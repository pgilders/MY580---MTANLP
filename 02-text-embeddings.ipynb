Unique words in a document give us more information about the document, so they receive a higher score.

    "\n",
    "The aformentioned methods of representing text are known as **bag-of-words** models. They are simple and effective, but they have some limitations. For example, they do not take into account the order of the words in the text, and they do not capture the meaning of the words. Without some dimensionality reduction attempts they are also too unwieldy to work with. This is where embeddings come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, an embedding is a dense vector representation of a piece of text (could be a word or document) such that the vector captures the semantic \"meaning\" of the text. Words or documents that are similar in meaning should end up with vectors that are close to each other in this vector space. This idea underpins a lot of modern NLP – instead of dealing with words as discrete symbols, we embed them in a continuous multidimensional vector space that a machine learning model can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Word embeddings\n",
    "  * Map individual words to vectors. These models learn from large corpora such that words used in similar contexts end up near each other in the vector space (i.e. their vectors look similar). For example, “king” and “queen” might be close in space, and analogies can be solved with vector arithmetic (classic example: king – man + woman ≈ queen). Word2Vec and GloVe are classic algorithms that produce word embeddings. More advanced models like BERT and GPT also produce contextualized word embeddings, meaning the same word can have different vectors depending on its context in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentence / document embeddings\n",
    "  * Produce a vector for a whole sentence or larger text. This is often done by using models like BERT (a transformer) or specialized sentence embedding models (like Sentence Transformers) that aggregate meaning over multiple words. Sentence embeddings are useful to compare similarity of entire sentences or to feed documents into clustering or classification algorithms."
