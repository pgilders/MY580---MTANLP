141742,"Johnson’s decision is political, but it’s right to end Covid restrictions in England | Simon Jenkins",2022-02-21 17:51:35+00:00,Opinion,"Boris Johnson’s use of apocalyptic demons to aid his survival in office knows no limit. Since his near-death experience of “partygate”, he has shamelessly exploited war, floods and pestilence. All have responded. Pestilence is now his greatest ally. The decision announced today to end all remaining pandemic restriction measures in England goes flatly against his more cautious advisers and appears highly political. That does not make it wrong. The prime duty of government is to protect people from death and disease. After two years of Covid, the most basic measure of that protection is the “excess death rate” from all causes. In England this is now negative, that is, running below the seasonal norm, while Covid-related hospitalisations across the entire UK are falling fast. The crisis is over. Were Covid not in the air, mass testing for, say, infectious flu would seem an excessive precaution, given the government’s claims that it costs an astronomical £2bn a month. Whether this continues apparently remains a matter of argument. It is true that excess deaths also fell a year ago before the return of Covid via the Omicron variant, a return not remotely as serious as previous variants. It was countered by the clearly effective remedy of vaccination. Nonetheless, the return was enough for “the science” to challenge Johnson’s decision to end quarantine requirements and scale back mass testing. He is determined to “return to normal” after two years of national disruption, leaving individuals and organisations to make their own judgments on caution, as with other diseases. Yes, he says, it is a risk, but his job is to judge risks, and sometimes to take them.
In this case Johnson is surely right. Leaving aside vaccination – unquestioned hero of the hour – the external cost of the Covid lockdown has been unquantifiable but appalling. In medicine alone, cancers have gone unreported, with other illnesses untreated and mental health neglected. The money spent on lockdown compensation, much of it reckless and some even corrupt, has been denied to other welfare uses. The cost to child welfare is inestimable, as has been the cost to education. It is, of course, possible that ending mandatory self-isolation may lead to another upturn, though whether this should justify a return of lockdown must be doubted. Support for the clinically vulnerable should remain, and be shored up with new resources. More to the point is that the government – and the country – should now be able to turn its resources and attention to recovering from Covid’s wider damage to the nation’s welfare caused over the past two years. It is worrying how rarely those pleading for continued lockdown refer to this damage. It is as if because a cost is unquantifiable in the short term it does not exist. Too often scientists sound like just another interest group out to protect its reputation and budget. As Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College London modelling group were quoted as admitting: “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression.” It is why Sweden’s decision to avoid a draconian lockdown merits serious analysis. Its GDP fell by 2.9%, Britain’s by 9.4%. In the European league tables Sweden falls around the middle in deaths per capita, still well below Britain. Experts should be on tap, not on top. They should be listened to but not obeyed. We vote for politicians to rule us and no one else, thank goodness. Now Johnson can get back to his other demons, still dancing attendance at his door.

114331,Ten reasons why we got Covid-19 vaccines so quickly without 'cutting corners' | Adam Finn,2020-12-26 13:44:04+00:00,Opinion,"The speed at which effective Covid-19 vaccines have come through to authorisation has caused surprise. Compared with previous vaccines, the process has been very fast and so, naturally, people are asking how can it have happened without some kind of compromise on standards and care. Explaining it all as simply a result of the wonders of the latest scientific advances seems vague. So how has it actually come about? In reality, there are at least 10 reasons: some are about good planning, some good science and some just good luck. 1. Pandemic plans were already in place Long before the Covid-19 crisis, there was an awareness that a pandemic of some sort was likely in the coming years and plans had already been made to tackle it. Governments, international agencies and foundations had been pooling resources. The international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in 2017, and when Covid-19 arrived they were ready. In addition, several companies and academic institutions, notably including BioNTech, Moderna and the University of Oxford, had also been working on new technologies capable of generating vaccines from the genetic codes of infectious pathogens and cancers, and testing them for several years. 2. China identified a novel coronavirus early on Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang at Fudan University, Shanghai, and colleagues in China quickly obtained material from an early case of Covid-19 and identified a novel coronavirus. They elucidated the genetic sequence of the RNA in the virus very quickly and made the information public. That fired the starting gun for vaccine production. The fact that the RNA and viral vector vaccine platforms needed only the nucleotide sequence of the virus (the genetic code used by all living things from viruses to whales to reproduce themselves – in effect a series of letters you could send as a text message), and not a sample of the actual virus, allowed design and manufacture to happen very fast. 3. Substantial funding was granted immediately The vaccine developers had access to immediate and substantial funding. Normally, getting money to develop new vaccines takes time: either you have to persuade grant-funding agencies or charities and their advisers – who are often your competitors – that your ideas are sound, or, if you are a company, you have to persuade your own directors or external funders to invest. With the health and economic costs of the pandemic so great, funders enabled all plausible options, while CEPI was also ready to support the most promising proposals immediately. 4. The clinical trials process was speeded up The processes of writing clinical trial protocols and getting the necessary approvals to carry them out was speeded up. This usually evolves very slowly – ethics committees and regulators have to fit them into long queues of proposals. But this time researchers were working and meeting at all hours and extra personnel were drafted in. Committees received applications, prioritised them and made decisions usually within 24 hours. Everyone redoubled their efforts to put these studies first. 5. Vaccine trials started straightaway Experienced vaccine teams were swiftly able to run Covid-19 vaccine trials. In the UK, there were already four centres ready to start the Oxford vaccine study immediately and, through the National Institute for Health Research, which coordinates all clinical trials done by the NHS, an additional 14 sites were identified and set up for the larger phase 2-3 studies that followed. 6. Research data was collected electronically Information technology was readily available and made use of. Clinical trials have been slow to embrace electronic methods of data recording and collection for fear of glitches. Paper records are familiar, solid objects that everyone can see and believe in, but they are slow and error-prone. Where other sectors have led, research has now finally followed. When you buy an airline ticket, you do it online and the form does not allow you to make mistakes or omit important pieces of information before you complete a purchase. Such characteristics are also vital for data collection and, during the three to five years prior to this pandemic, research trials have been switching to this approach, with data collected straight into computers and tablets in the clinic. Mistakes and omissions are rare. Information is immediately available for analysis even as it is being collected. 7. Studies attracted a huge number of volunteers There is massive public support for, and engagement with, these studies. Many people wanted to take part and help out. Typically, vaccine trials take weeks or months to recruit, but for these studies – assisted by the speed of media information, social media and the ability of subjects to register interest instantly online – it was possible to identify willing volunteers within just a few hours. Without the participants the studies could not happen. 8. Trials have yielded rapid results For results, there need to be cases of disease. Even with all this speed, large-scale trials only got going towards the end or after the first wave of Covid-19 cases in most countries. While low rates of disease during the summer in many places was great news for our health, sanity and the economy, it actually made the trials more difficult. If you have large numbers of people who have had vaccine or control injections, in order to find out whether the vaccine works you need cases of Covid-19 to occur. You hope the cases will mostly be among the controls. But if no one gets sick you are none the wiser. The arrival of the second wave is a massive public health challenge, but it has enabled these trials to yield results rapidly. 9. Early vaccines worked well It’s much quicker to get a result on a vaccine that works well than one that only works feebly. Even a vaccine that only prevents a small proportion of cases could be useful in the context of a pandemic, but it takes longer to find out whether a weaker effect is really there. If a vaccine were 100% effective (no such vaccine exists but just for the sake of argument) then you might only need about 20 cases of disease in your study – which would all occur among the controls – to be almost certain that the vaccine caused the imbalance of 20 sick controls and no sick vaccinated people. But if the vaccine was only moderately effective, 20 cases would not be nearly enough. Seven cases in vaccine recipients and 13 in controls could be due to vaccine-induced protection, but could also easily be chance and a vaccine having no effect at all. You would want many more cases – for example, 70 to 130 – to be more sure of your result. But getting 10 times more cases would take much longer. The fact that the early vaccines have worked well has made it quicker to be much more certain about the strength of their protective effects. 10. Regulation took place while the studies were continuing Using “rolling review”, a completely different approach was taken to regulatory approval this time. Normally all the trial results and data are prepared in a massive package once the studies are finished, a process taking months. The whole lot is then presented to the regulators, which are the agencies that issue licences for drugs and vaccines, and they then begin their review, another process taking months. This time the data was provided to the regulatory agencies as they were being generated and was being reviewed while the studies were ongoing. When the final results came in, those were the only results left to be reviewed. The whole process took months, but the last steps took only days. Authorisation is not the end of this “fast vaccines” story. Rollout and administration of vaccines began almost immediately. That isn’t normal either. No sensible company would start manufacturing vaccine until it knew it would definitely be allowed to sell it, but this time the manufacturing was done at risk and in advance. If the vaccines had failed, all of the doses already made would have had to have been scrapped. Fortunately, that has not happened. There are more vaccines in the pipeline and we have more to learn about the ones that have arrived – much more information about safety and side-effects will accumulate as they are given to far larger numbers. But the fact we are already in a position to start protecting vulnerable and the highly exposed people by immunisation is the result of foresight, hard work and some lucky breaks.

114744,Travel bans aren't an effective response to the new Covid variant | Angela Rasmussen,2020-12-23 10:17:31+00:00,Opinion,"By now we all know a new variant of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been detected in the UK and is spreading rapidly. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, announced that the variant, called B.1.1.7, is up to 70% more transmissible based on modelling studies. B.1.1.7 caused many infections in south-east England in a short period of time, rapidly displacing other circulating variants. Patients infected with B.1.1.7 also had higher viral loads. While this is certainly concerning, and warrants urgent scientific investigation, data supporting that this variant alone is driving the associated increase in cases is preliminary and inconclusive. Nonetheless, politicians began implementing sweeping policies right away. Multiple countries have imposed travel bans, greatly reducing travel from the UK or blocking it entirely. France closed its borders to most freight transport. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, called on the US government to impose numerous restrictions, including banning travel from Europe. He later settled for mandatory rapid testing for all travellers on US-bound flights from the UK. Given the high prevalence of all variants of Sars-CoV-2, including in the UK and many countries abroad, imposing onerous travel restrictions alone is unlikely to make a significant impact in the overall pandemic. Furthermore, they may be too late. The B.1.1.7 variant has been reported in other European countries, as well as in Australia. These policies appear to be based more on the fear of variants with unknown properties rather than the actual data, and are due to a persistent and fundamental misunderstanding of viruses and how they evolve and change when spreading through a population. Genetic mutation, the process that drives all evolutionary adaptation, is normal and expected, particularly for viruses. Every time the virus copies its genetic material – called its genome – it can make a mistake. If that mistake isn’t corrected, it will be copied the next time the virus replicates its genome. Mutations occur by chance, but if they happen to occur in a critical place and give the virus an advantage that allows it to outcompete other viral variants, they are said to be under positive evolutionary selection. For example, mutations in the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, which allows the virus to enter and infect cells, can be selected for if they make the virus more efficient at establishing an infection. We can probably expect to see other variants that may be more effective at spreading, causing disease or circumventing our immune responses. We must be prepared to respond in an informed and thoughtful way, rather than reactively. Unfortunately, because Sars-CoV-2 is spreading so widely, the virus has many opportunities to develop mutations that give it a competitive advantage. The only way to stop the virus from mutating is to take away its ability to replicate, which means drastically reducing community transmission. Mutations do not automatically make a virus a more exceptional pathogen. The advantages conferred by positively selected viral mutations are good for the virus, but aren’t necessarily always bad for the human host. Many mutations can make the virus better at infecting cells, replicating, or transmitting to new hosts, but will have no effect on the severity or type of disease that they cause. In the case of B.1.1.7, there is fortunately no indication that the 23 mutations distinguishing the variant result in more severe Covid-19. The claim that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible is based on primarily epidemiological evidence and data on increased viral loads, and is compelling but far from decisive. To demonstrate conclusively that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible, that needs to be quantified experimentally in animal models of Sars-CoV-2 transmission. Even if B.1.1.7 does prove to be more transmissible, it is not likely to be transmitted in a different way from all the other circulating Sars-CoV-2 variants. It has not acquired viral superpowers that render existing precautions irrelevant, and it is still transmitted primarily through inhaling or having direct contact with infectious respiratory aerosols and droplets. One thing that is unlikely to make much of an impact is the kind of travel ban ostensibly imposed to prevent the export of B.1.1.7 from the UK. This reflectsa simplistic understanding of how viruses spread and evolve, as well as how we detect the emergence of new, potentially consequential variants such as B.1.1.7. The UK is a global leader in genomic surveillance, the practice of sequencing the genomes of the viruses causing new cases. B.1.1.7 is likely to be circulating in other countries already, and simply hasn’t been detected yet because of already high Sars-CoV-2 prevalence and less comprehensive genomic surveillance. Draconian measures can encourage panic and make the situation worse. When the lockdown and domestic travel restrictions were announced in the UK, passengers packed train station platforms and crowded carriages to leave London prior to enforcement of tier 4 restrictions, creating conditions conducive to virus spread. Rather than harsh and largely ineffective travel bans, we should instead focus on encouraging compliance with proven interventions such as masking, distancing, avoiding crowds and enclosed spaces, avoiding gathering outside of one’s household or quarantine pod, and practising good hand hygiene. By emphasising the additive nature of risk reduction, transmission can be reduced in a way that empowers people with the information to make good decisions to protect themselves and their families. Though we do not yet know for sure whether or not B.1.1.7 is substantially more transmissible, we do know that the pandemic is out of control throughout most of the world. We must balance scientific uncertainty with sensible approaches that we already know are effective at reducing community transmission, regardless of what we learn about B.1.1.7. Dramatic measures put in place through fear and uncertainty squander an opportunity to increase participation in the measures that are known to reduce transmission, regardless of a virus’s innate propensity to spread to new hosts. We have already suffered unacceptable losses from Covid-19. To truly contain the pandemic, leaders and policymakers should calmly educate and engage the public, rather than risking panic through scrambled, incoherent measures.

137811,"Small steps or an irresponsible lack of action: Australian experts react to national cabinet’s announcement | Catherine Bennet, Nancy Baxter, Raina MacIntyre",2021-12-22 16:30:32+00:00,Opinion,"‘National consistency would be helpful’ With the advent of Omicron, we have a little more national accord in aspects of our public health strategy; we need to slow Omicron down as it moves through the population, and we should aim to do so while avoiding lockdown. The national vaccine program – especially boosters – is central to containing Omicron, and will be boosted itself with better funding incentives from the commonwealth to GPs, and pharmacies and the states ramping up hubs once again. But the other two areas of control focus may continue to be inconsistent across jurisdictions – partly due to different infection pressures, but also down to differences in risk tolerance that Omicron has not nudged aside. The package of proven strategies that help contain spread, whether the virus is already circulating in the community or to reduce impact if it is reintroduced, are one and the same; masks, physical distancing, hygiene and managing gatherings safely. These were recognised today as a critical pillar in disease control, but the management of these resides with our states and territories, and there wasn’t agreement on how these should be implemented.
What is critical is how well the advice is adhered to, and whether measures already in place need to be tightened. National consistency would be helpful to convey a clear message on the importance of these measures. If there is high compliance in New South Wales already with reportedly 85% mask wearing in retail settings, then introducing a mask rule is not really an impost. Conversely, if rules in other jurisdictions are not achieving high compliance, then that needs to be looked at too. We are moving to greater consistency in case and contact follow-up, but priorities change as resources are spread more thinly when case infection rates grow, and states with low case numbers want to continue more aggressive case follow-up while they can. QR codes still have a role, whether as an outbreak investigation tool in low infection settings or allowing automatic notification of contact with an exposure site or as a memory prompt of your movements in high transmission areas. Small steps on Wednesday, but at least this may be a platform for greater national consistency as the coronavirus progressively moves through our community and both our goals and our case load become more uniform. • Catherine Bennett is chair in epidemiology at Deakin University ‘Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly’ It seems it is still not a race. There is a clear need to mandate minimally intrusive but highly protective measures such as masks and QR codes anywhere that Omicron is spreading in the community. The lack of action after the national cabinet meeting held on Wednesday is difficult to understand. We need leadership in making mask-wearing indoors mandatory – leaving this to “personal responsibility” is frankly irresponsible. Wearing a mask to prevent Covid is not analogous to putting on sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. No amount of sunscreen I slap on will protect you from skin cancer. In contrast, Covid is an airborne transmissible virus so if you wear a mask it protects me and vice versa. And all of us wearing masks consistently will protect the health system.
We need to ensure high testing and tracing capacity – for the latter, QR codes are the only way to keep up when case numbers are high. We have invested in the infrastructure for digital tracing so it makes no sense to throw it all away. The 3,763 cases in New South Wales on Wednesday will have up to 80,000 contacts, and the contacts are the most likely to become the next cases. If we don’t alert the contacts, the epidemic will explode, health systems will collapse and we may be forced into the lockdown that we never wanted after all. Magical thinking will not stop this – only a smart, layered strategy will do that. For NSW to abandon everything as cases surge during the time of maximal gatherings, will result in avoidable illness and death. But it seems that any national strategy for TTQI can wait another two weeks for the next cabinet meeting. We learned on Wednesday there are 20m doses of mRNA vaccine in Australia. It is fantastic that we have the supply but vaccine in the fridge won’t help manage the Omicron surge. Maintaining the delivery of boosters over the Christmas holidays will save lives but that won’t happen without a plan. Other countries have called in the army. We are giving a $10 a dose incentive. With surging cases, NSW Health is already preparing us to turn our homes into hospitals – they advise if you are under 50, manage your Covid at home, and call your GP if you need help. Most GP practices are operating on skeleton staff over the holidays, so good luck with that. There will be preventable deaths of people at home who were unable to access care. We all need to take responsibility for avoiding the worst-case scenario of the Omicron wave. Our leaders are relying on Australians to act responsibly. Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly as well. • Nancy Baxter is head of the school of population and global health at the University of Melbourne.
