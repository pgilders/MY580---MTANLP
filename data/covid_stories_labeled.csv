137504,"The pandemic is a warning: we must take care of the earth, our only home | Bruno Latour",2021-12-24 14:00:26+00:00,Opinion,"There is a moment when a never-ending crisis turns into a way of life. This seems to be the case with the pandemic. If so, it’s wise to explore the permanent condition in which it has left us. One obvious lesson is that societies have to learn once again to live with pathogens, just as they learned to when microbes were first made visible by the discoveries of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. These discoveries were concerned with only one aspect of microbial life. When you also consider the various sciences of the earth system, another aspect of viruses and bacteria comes to the fore. During the long geochemical history of the earth, microbes, together with fungi and plants, have been essential, and are still essential, to the very composition of the environment in which we humans live. The pandemic has shown us that we will never escape the invasive presence of these living beings, entangled as we are with them. They react to our actions; if they mutate, we have to mutate as well. This is why the many national lockdowns, imposed on citizens to help them survive the virus, are a powerful analogy for the situation in which humanity finds itself detained for good. Lockdown was painful enough, and yet many ways have been found, thanks in part to vaccination, to allow people to resume a semblance of normal life. But there is no possibility of such a resumption if you consider that all living forms are locked down for good inside the limits of the earth. And by “earth” I don’t mean the planet as it can be seen from space, but its very superficial pellicle, the shallow layer of earth in which we live, and which has been transformed into a habitable milieu by the aeons-long labour of evolution. This thin matrix is what geochemists call the “critical zone”, the only layer of earth where terrestrial life can flourish. It’s in this finite space where everything we care for and everything we have ever encountered exists. There is no way of escaping our earth-bound existence; as young climate activists shout: “There is no planet B.” Here is the connection between the Covid lockdowns we have experienced in the past two years, and the much larger but definitive state of lockdown that we find ourselves in: we are trapped in an environment that we have already altered irreversibly. If we have been made aware of the agency of viruses in shaping our social relations, we must now reckon with the fact that they will also be moulded for ever by the climate crisis and the quick reactions of ecosystems to our actions. The feeling that we live in a new space appears again at the local as well as the global level. Why would all nations convene in Glasgow to keep global temperature rises below some agreed upon limit, if they did not have the sensation that a huge lid had been put over their territory? When you look up at the blue sky, are you not aware that you are now under some sort of dome inside which you are locked? Gone is the infinite space; now you are responsible for the safety of this overbearing dome as much as you are for your own health and wealth. It weighs on you, body and soul. To survive under these new conditions we have to undergo a sort of metamorphosis. This is where politics enters. It is very difficult for most people used to the industrialised way of life, with its dream of infinite space and its insistence on emancipation and relentless growth and development, to suddenly sense that it is instead enveloped, confined, tucked inside a closed space where their concerns have to be shared with new entities: other people of course, but also viruses, soils, coal, oil, water, and, worst of all, this damned, constantly shifting climate. This disorienting shift is unprecedented, even cosmological, and it is already a source of deep political divisions. Although the sentence “you and I don’t live on the same planet” used to be a joking expression of dissent, it has become true of our present reality. We do live on different planets, with rich people employing private fire fighters and scouting for climate bunkers, while their poorer counterparts are forced to migrate, suffer and die amid the worst consequences of the crisis. This is why it is important not to misconstrue the political conundrum of our present age. It is of the same magnitude as when, from the 17th century onward, westerners had to shift from the closed cosmos of the past to the infinite space of the modern period. As the cosmos seemed to open, political institutions had to be invented to work through the new and utopian possibilities offered by the Enlightenment. Now, in reverse, the same task falls to present generations: what new political institutions could they invent to cope with people so divided that they belong to different planets? It would be a mistake to believe that the pandemic is a crisis that will end, instead of the perfect warning for what is coming, what I call the new climatic regime. It appears that all the resources of science, humanities and the arts will have to be mobilised once again to shift attention to our shared terrestrial condition.

97883,Coronavirus is the first crisis Johnson has faced that can't be played for laughs | Rafael Behr,2020-03-24 16:06:06+00:00,Opinion,"The years running up to the present crisis will be remembered as a period of complacency, although it felt tumultuous enough at the time. A pandemic and the steps taken to contain it force a dizzying adjustment of perspective. With one twist of the lens, events that once loomed large are made remote – dots on the horizon in a bygone era.
In the parallel universe where there is no Covid-19, British politics is gearing up for local and mayoral elections; a second round of Brexit trade negotiations began this week, and Labour leadership contenders are out on the stump. Yet instead we are in a place where elections are suspended along with nearly every other outdoor expression of political freedom. Democracy is confined to quarters, as is necessary to prevent transmission of the virus. We know that lockdown can save lives. We do not yet know which muscles of civil society will atrophy from lack of exercise. The coronavirus bill, rushed through parliament this week, is a totalitarian beast on a constitutional leash, held by MPs whose grip is unproven. The government had sought extreme powers for a year but acquiesced to cross-party demands for a six-month expiry date, with an option to renew. Meanwhile, ministers can shut businesses, disperse crowds, detain citizens. Police can treat the nation as if it were under house arrest. Those are the headline cuts in liberty but the law’s finer print tells a chilling story of cultural changes yet to be imposed by Covid-19. The bill gives local authorities power to requisition facilities for storing and disposing of dead bodies. It eases rules designed to prevent wrongful detention on grounds of mental ill health. Such measures can be justified for the greater good, as efficient marshalling of limited resources. But every compromise on due process scatters seeds of negligence in shaded corners of the state, where cruelties and injustice can grow. The gravity of the moment was not lost on the depleted ranks of MPs who debated the bill. None of them had confronted an equivalent challenge: to suppress public activity without wanton violence to democracy. The respectful tone of debate would be unfamiliar to anyone who only tunes into parliament for its rowdiest fixtures. Even the participants found the mood unusual, prefacing speeches with generosity for old enemies – Scottish nationalists praising former Tory cabinet ministers who praised Labour front benchers. The comparison is naturally made with wartime solidarity, although the likeness is inexact. A military foe does not hijack banal social relations as insidiously as viral transmission. And there is not much collective memory of what it really means for individuals to submerge selfish needs in an enterprise of collective duty. Too many people became accomplices to the virus by ignoring government advice. Voluntary submission was not working. Andrew Bowie, Tory party vice chair, said over the weekend: “This is not a game.” It should not have needed saying, except it did because games are what politics has seemed to be all about in recent years. People can be forgiven if they were slow to take a threat seriously when Westminster culture has so often projected frivolity. The prime minister has built a career from raffish disobedience, seeing diligence as the mark of a “girly swot”. Boris Johnson was not elected to be the nation’s head prefect, and has struggled to adapt to the role. Only in his address to the nation on Monday night, declaring mass lockdown, did he find the right pitch – assertive simplicity. He stripped away the rhetorical ornamentation that usually laces his phrases with playful insincerity. He finally achieved gravitas without it sounding like a pastiche of statesmanship. He wisely eschewed any references to the Blitz spirit or other pseudo-Churchillian vibes, perhaps recognising that he has devalued that currency with over-use in less deserving circumstances. The prime minister’s supporters say he has been reluctant to impose social controls that grate against his liberal instinct. There is some truth in that defence, although it flatters the man to prop up his wobbly indecision with a sturdy-sounding philosophy. Johnson likes freedom, but above all for himself. His creed that is now said to be anti-authoritarian is just the stuff of old Daily Telegraph polemics against pettifogging bureaucracy. Its ethical core is hardly more developed than the loathing for ’elf-and-safety that tickled many a Tory conference fringe meeting. There is a continuum between the Johnson who once described the obligation to put children in car booster seats for their own safety as “utterly demented”, and the man who resisted closing pubs in a public health emergencybut it is not a connection that casts the prime minister in the best light. Johnson likes to be liked, so he tells people what they want to hear. He is a master of politics that makes no moral demands of citizens. He offers freedoms unburdened with responsibility. He brilliantly swept away doubts about Brexit, belittling the hazard as a figment of timid imaginations. He has sauntered through a charmed life believing that risks are mitigated by declaring them exaggerated. Coronavirus does not respond to that treatment. It might be the first adversary Johnson has met that cannot be outmanoeuvred with political chicanery. It is revealing how a politician who has always talked his way out of trouble took so long to find his voice in this crisis. He is used to people rallying to his charisma, but the precedent was misleading. His method has been to offer treats without naming a price. A different political quality is needed to persuade people to make sacrifices. The gap between official advice on social distancing and its being followed had to be bridged with moral authority, which was hard to summon for a prime minister who has always invited his audience to be complicit in his complacency. Thousands of lives were put at risk because Downing Street was slow to grasp the magnitude of the threat and hesitant with remedies. The most generous account of the delay suggests that Britain was blessed with a prime minister who did not itch to grab dictatorial powers. There is some reassurance there, although we cannot yet say what the effect of those powers might be on ministers who get into the habit of wielding them.
We must entrust our civil rights to parliament but also to some supposedly liberal substance coursing through the prime minister’s veins. That would be easier if he did not come to the job with a record of recklessness and indifference to the cost his gambles force on other people. Only when confronted with a crisis that cannot be played for laughs has Johnson understood that politics is not a game. And he was persuaded by nothing nobler than the feeling that his old way wasn’t winning any more. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",0
96704,"As the west is in lockdown, China is slowly getting back to business | Daniel Falush",2020-03-30 05:00:14+00:00,Opinion,"When China shut down its economy at the end of January to try to control the coronavirus outbreak, it was a bold and terrifying experiment. No one had tried anything similar. It was unclear whether the virus’s spread could be curbed, let alone halted. It was also possible that, as a respiratory virus with highly variable symptoms, coronavirus was simply too transmissible and too difficult to detect for these measures to work. But work they did and now China is the first nation to enter into the next phase of the pandemic – attempting to reinstate everyday life against the backdrop of coronavirus. But how much can economic life and daily freedom be restored without risking a “second wave” of the virus? Since I returned six weeks ago to my home in Shanghai from a trip to Europe, the city has progressively come back to life. First, the number of people on the streets started to increase. Then restaurants began to reopen and, slowly, filled up. As of this past week, it is no longer compulsory to wear a mask when going shopping or on public transport, and it is no longer compulsory for restaurants and shops to take the temperatures of customers, as they had been doing previously. Nevertheless, people here are still being careful. The only ones you see on the streets not wearing masks are old men, who never obeyed the rules anyway. Most venues still take temperature readings and do an increasingly good job. All of my recent readings have been between 36C and 37C – rather than the improbable 33C to 35C range I was registering a couple of weeks ago.
For the adventurous, there is even a bit of nightlife. I have gone clubbing twice in last six weeks. Steps in this direction though are slow and cautious. After announcing that cinemas would reopen this weekend, the authorities immediately announced they would close again after an uptick in reported cases. Meanwhile, stringent measures are in place reducing travel from the outside world. Scepticism exists in the west as to whether China has been as successful in suppressing the virus as it claims. What I can say concretely is this. The chief tools that China has used to control the outbreak are rapid detection and isolation of symptomatic cases, together with 14-day quarantining, normally at home, of everyone who is even remotely likely to have recently come into contact with them. The extensive army of busybodies responsible for detecting and isolating cases remains firmly in place, as do the frequently used apps that chart the positions of every known case, with a colour code indicating how long ago that case occurred. Red for less than a week ago, orange for between one and two weeks and yellow for more than two weeks. I do not believe there has been a cover-up. Covering up cases would render the tools used for controlling the outbreak ineffective. There might be a few local officials who are unwise enough to attempt it, but at the regional or national scale it appears extremely unlikely. As in every other country, there are caveats to interpreting the numbers, especially in badly affected regions, but the overall evidence is unequivocal: suppression has worked. China has had a few advantages over other countries in dealing with the outbreak, resulting from its social and political system. One is the ability to deliver consistent messaging. When the lockdown took place, the normal television schedule was suspended and replaced with wall-to-wall coronavirus coverage, devoted to the importance of not letting the disease spread. As a result, the people of China are, generally speaking, more afraid of catching the virus than of running out of food or losing their livelihoods. Whether or not Xi Jinping is personally scared of infection, I do not know, but he has done a disciplined job of behaving so. This falls in stark contrast to Boris Johnson, who caught Covid-19 himself after boasting of attending a hospital treating sufferers and shaking lots of hands. Xi waited until the outbreak was firmly under control before visiting Wuhan. When he spoke with patients and healthcare workers, he did so by video link, even keeping a healthy degree of social distancing from his microphone. Due to the broad adherence to government edict, a blanket lockdown has thankfully never been necessary in Shanghai or most other places in China. I, just like almost everyone else, stayed at home anyway.
Everything now could be, to a degree, harder in the west. It looks very much as if lockdowns will, on average, need to be longer and stricter than in China – with freedoms regained over a longer period. The numbers of cases in the population have been higher on the date at which lockdowns were imposed. Once the numbers of cases in the community are down to manageable levels, technological solutions – such as antibody tests and contact tracing – might do some of the job of the army of busybodies here. But until that point, mass physical distancing will remain necessary. In my own opinion, the costs of suppressing the outbreak are absolutely worth it. What many people on the right in the west, including Donald Trump, have failed to appreciate is that, in economic terms, harbouring coronavirus is unfeasible. Until a country has shown that it has brought transmission under control, normal economic life cannot resume. Tourists will not visit and international travel will not be permissible – meaning that, until they get coronavirus under control within their own borders, countries will not be able to again join the world community of freely trading nations. That community today seems to consist of China alone. • Daniel Falush is a professor at the Centre for Microbes, Development and Health at the Institute Pasteur in Shanghai",0
135051,Scientists sharing Omicron data were heroic. Let’s ensure they don’t regret it | Jeffrey Barrett,2021-11-28 09:00:21+00:00,Opinion,"One of the positive experiences during two years of pandemic gloom has been the speed of scientific progress in understanding and treating Covid. Many effective vaccines were launched in less than a year and rapid large-scale trials found a cheap and effective drug, dexamethasone, that saved thousands of lives. The global scientific community has also carried out “genomic surveillance” – sequencing the genome of the virus to track how it evolves and spreads at an unprecedented level: the public genome database has more than 5.5m genomes. The great value of that genomic surveillance, underpinned by a commitment to rapid and open sharing of the data by all countries in near-real time, has been seen in the last few days as we’ve learned of the Covid variant called Omicron. The surveillance requires a remarkable amount of cooperation between scientists to build compatible laboratory protocols, software systems and databases. Many of these scientists are not directly paid for this work and do it in addition to their existing jobs. They are motivated by a belief that sharing data relevant to public health, especially in a pandemic, can help speed up scientific understanding, aid in decision-making and contribute to the next generation of medicines. This commitment to rapid data sharing has deep roots in genomics. At a 1996 summit in Bermuda, the leaders of the Human Genome Project established a set of principles to release a new DNA sequence to public databases within 24 hours. This approach departed from the established convention that experimental data only needed to be released when a study was published, months or years later. Sir John Sulston, founding director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “All of this [genome data] should be in the public domain... I think we need a public social welfare attitude to the use of this information.” That attitude now prevails around the world, as evidenced by the rapid sharing of more than 1m Sars-CoV-2 sequences by the Sanger Institute since March 2020. On 23 November, scientists in Botswana uploaded 99 Sars-CoV-2 genome sequences to this database. Like most submissions that day, nearly all the sequences were the dominant Delta variant. But three of them looked different from anything seen before. Later the same day, an independent team in South Africa uploaded seven nearly identical genomes. These teams noticed that the new variant contained an eye-watering number of mutations in the part of the virus’s genome that encodes the spike protein, which it uses to infect human cells. Most concerningly, nearly half of these mutations had previously been seen in the earlier variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) or predicted in laboratory experiments to increase the virus’s ability to latch on to human cells. They notified health authorities of their concerns and began an immediate investigation into how widespread this new variant might be. While these scientists worked around the clock, the fact that they had shared the sequences with the world as part of their routine process, before they even knew what they were, meant that other scientists, thousands of miles away, could study them as well. Within just a few hours of the sequences being shared, a post was made on the pango designation forum, a corner of the internet where virus genome experts discuss new sequences and assign name that makes it easier to refer to specific parts of the Sars-CoV-2 family trees. The mutations in the new variant also alarmed the international scientists. It was quickly dubbed B.1.1.529 and prioritised for further study. Once additional evidence gathered by the local teams in South Africa had been presented, the World Health Organization (WHO) made it the fifth variant of concern, Omicron. Just 72 hours had passed since the original discovery.
The scientists who sounded the alarm because they are committed to the moral imperative of rapid data sharing knew that in the midst of the pandemic it would have consequences. Tulio de Oliveira, one of the leaders of the South African genomics team, announcing the variant, tweeted: “The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it! By protecting and supporting it, we will protect the world!” By the next day, dozens of countries, including the UK, had announced new travel restrictions on countries in southern Africa. Some restrictions may have been unavoidable to buy time to understand this new threat, but travel bans come with serious consequences for people and economies in affected countries. Previously, they have delayed, but not prevented, the spread of new variants. There is some chance in this situation that they may be more effective, precisely because of the excellent work done to share information so rapidly. Genomic surveillance in India when Delta appeared was less comprehensive and the seriousness of that new variant did not become apparent until weeks after it had been circulating widely, and exported around the world. While scientists around the world are scrambling to understand Omicron, and national governments are making response plans, we must also find ways to reward the critical early warning provided by South Africa. Less than 25% of South Africans are fully vaccinated, and while that may be due to complicated reasons involving both supply and demand, it is not for us in the rest of the world to determine what would be most helpful. Countries with an abundance of vaccine doses and other resources should offer whatever is asked for by countries now at the front edge of the confrontation with Omicron. The pandemic has emphasised that we are a single global community and our policy responses must reflect that reality. It would be a disaster if the global response to this heroically open science sent the message that the reward for such bravery is isolation. • Jeffrey Barrett is leading the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute",1
99032,Coronavirus can only be beaten if groups such as Sage are transparent and accountable | Richard Coker,2020-04-27 10:51:46+00:00,Opinion,"Earlier this month in the Guardian, the Lancet editor, Richard Horton, suggested that “coronavirus is the greatest global science policy failure in a generation”. He recalled the many experts who have been predicting such a pandemic, some for decades, and argued that in the UK, “the experts – scientists who have modelled and simulated our possible futures – made assumptions that turned out to be mistaken.” If he is right, and I think he is, then we should ask, why? I’ve been researching the control of infectious diseases for 30 years, and I believe that an earlier debacle – one perhaps forgotten by many – offers insights. In 1976, fearful that an outbreak of swine influenza at Fort Dix army camp in New Jersey was the centre of an influenza pandemic on a scale potentially similar to the 1918 Spanish flu, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised President Gerald Ford of the urgent need for a mass immunisation programme.
The similarity between this swine influenza and the 1918 pandemic was overstated. But in the meantime, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. And the vaccine was associated with cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, some fatal. In the immediate aftermath, the affair was seen as a fiasco. In their remarkable study of the event, Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg set out the lessons learned. Their report, The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease, is unlike almost every other report I have ever read. It is a candid, unsanitised analysis that aims to determine the managerial errors made and draw lessons so that they would not be repeated. The report was commissioned by Joseph Califano, Ford’s secretary of health, education and welfare: “Lessons were what he wanted,” wrote the report’s authors, “not a history; finger-pointing did not interest him in terms of last time; his concern was with next time.” What lessons from that report should we reflect on now? Two, I think, are especially important. First, we should be cautious that experts may be overconfident in theories that are “spun from meagre evidence”. Second, we should question “scientific logic and implementation prospects”. The key issue the authors identified was that groupthink led to misjudgments of the evidence, and failed to question assumptions; and voices that opposed were silenced, excluded or denied entry. “Collegial relations” in key advisory committees were too close, many members worked “with mutual confidence”. They “would talk it out together before writing memoranda to each other”. In a critical passage, the report states: “Panels tend toward ‘group think’ and over-selling, tendencies nurtured by long-standing interchanges and intimacy, as in the influenza fraternity. Other competent scientists, who do not share their group identity or vested interests, should be able to appraise the scientific logic applied to available evidence.” I know many of the current members of the UK’s key government committees. The membership of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) is publicly available. The membership of the more important committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is responsible for scientific advice to the Cabinet Office briefing room, was revealed on Friday after a list was leaked. I like all the people I know on these committees. They are extremely bright. And I believe their values and motivations are “good”. But I worry that their intimacy, their familiarity, lends itself to groupthink. Are there sufficient contrarian views? Are critically important assumptions subjected to sufficient critique? Is groupthink acknowledged as a risk, and if so, how is it addressed? The roles taken on by the members are enormously important. The decision-making process is challenging, but must be scrutinised. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and self-identified member of Sage, has talked of receiving personal abuse because of his position on Sage. But the deliberations and minutes and, in my view, the academic disciplines of the members should be made public, if not members’ names. Transparency and scrutiny are critically important if groupthink is to be avoided. The revelation that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s adviser, has been attending Sage meetings, adds urgency to this demand.
Without this, the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the committee and its members will continue to be regarded as suspect. When political influence is added to groupthink among scientists – should it have occurred – then the result can only be a diminution of the committee’s authority and the advice it gives. In their report, Neustadt and Fineberg wrote: “Policy decisions regarding influenza rest on judgments about the behaviour of the virus, the impact of the disease and our ability to interdict its course. But the virus is capricious, the disease elusive, and our remedies imperfect.” All of us involved in attempting to control Covid-19, which means all of us, should reflect with humility, embrace those who challenge our assumptions, and draw on these lessons. • Richard Coker is emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine",0
120811,People are wary of pandemic art – but it will help us process the trauma of the time | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett,2021-03-24 12:00:01+00:00,Opinion,"I’ve been thinking a lot about David Wojnarowicz’s jacket, worn to a 1988 protest a year after the artist’s HIV diagnosis. Emblazoned on the back over the subverted pink triangle that came to be a symbol of the gay community’s fight for liberation were the words: “IF I DIE OF AIDS – FORGET BURIAL – JUST DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF THE FDA.” These words have echoed through the decades, transmitted and mutating, cultural commentators have noted, like a virus: “IF I DIE IN POLICE CUSTODY …”; “IF I DIE IN A SCHOOL SHOOTING …” A year ago, the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power, Act Up, the grassroots group dedicated to ending the Aids pandemic through political and artistic activism, and who put on a “political funeral” for Wojnarowicz when he died of Aids at the age of 37 in 1992, posted a new manifestation online: “IF I DIE OF COVID-19 – FORGET BURIAL DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF MAR-A-LAGO.” We are a year in, but in terms of Covid’s artistic impact, it’s obviously early days. On the one hand, the potential for great art is huge: the grief and the fury is ripe for channelling. “No, #COVID19 isn’t AIDS but the parallels are clear as day,” Act Up NY tweeted in March last year. “Vulnerable communities are taking the brunt of this pandemic due to overwhelming neglect. All the barriers in place (healthcare, pharma greed, housing, stigma, etc) that have kept HIV alive will keep this virus alive.” Yet there is also fatigue and an unwillingness to engage with any form of cultural response to the pandemic. Online, it has become fashionable to express dread about the slew of Covid novels, art, TV shows or films that will emerge. “I completely understand why the Spanish Flu was rarely if ever mentioned in 1920s literature and art. I do not want to watch any TV shows/movies or read a single novel about this fucking time,” tweeted the writer Rebecca Fishbein this week (340,000+ likes). She then added: “I can assure all of you that even if every single movie/film/book were exclusively about Covid going forward, humanity would still learn no lessons. See: Holocaust.” Perhaps it is unfair for me to single out the sentiments of a lone writer, but her words are symptomatic of a view that I have now seen and heard expressed countless times, both online and off, and they raise some interesting questions. Is the purpose of art to teach us lessons? Did not the Holocaust provoke a major 20th-century artistic shift? In asking the question, “how do we make art after Auschwitz?” ways of moving forward were found. The rise of abstraction resulted. And what about Primo Levi, Charlotte Salomon or Gerhard Richter, among others? The art and literature of the second world war, and the Great War before it, were a necessary processing of the trauma of mass death and destruction.
It is true that, as Fishbein notes, Spanish flu was called “the forgotten pandemic”. The reason usually cited for this artistic void is that it was overshadowed by the first world war. Certain works, of course, do come to mind: Edvard Munch’s two self-portraits, one of him with the Spanish flu, the other after he had recovered; Egon Schiele’s drawings: one of Gustav Klimt on his deathbed before he succumbed to the flu following a stroke, another, in 1918, of his dying pregnant wife Edith – Schiele himself would die several days after Edith and their unborn child, leaving behind his haunting unfinished painting The Family. There was literature, too, most notably in the 1930s, which saw The Doctor’s Son, a short story by John O’Hara, They Came Like Swallows by William Maxwell, and Pale Horse, Pale Rider by Katherine Anne Porter, which was inspired by Porter’s own experience of almost dying from influenza. However, the way the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic synthesised in cultural works was far more subtle than simple depiction. From the clean, hygienic lines of the Bauhaus and 1920s architecture – Charles Jencks said that “the deep metaphor of modernism was that of the operating theatre, the hospital, of a place where the difficulties of everyday life could be fumigated out” – to the morbid absurdism of dadaism, it cast a shadow. In literature, the pandemic can be “contact traced” again through modernism: Mrs Dalloway, The Waste Land, The Second Coming – it’s a spectre in all of them. This is the thesis of Elizabeth Outka’s Viral Modernism: The Influenza Pandemic and Interwar Literature. Outka speculates that the Spanish flu manifests spectrally because trauma itself is spectral – people remember it “diffusely”. And diseases, of course, are invisible. Furthermore, as Virginia Woolf notes in her essay On Being Ill, illnesses are essentially “plotless”: “the public,” she writes, “would say that a novel devoted to influenza lacked plot.” So where does this all leave us, in terms of making and consuming cultural products? Friends who work in television and publishing tell me that editors and commissioners are approaching works that deal with Covid with caution, suspecting that the public desperately want cheering up and a return to normality. One contact tells me that TV commissioners keep saying they “want works that feel like sinking into a warm bath”. Is this repression, or could it be that we are still in the midst of the trauma? Perhaps, like the art of the Spanish flu pandemic, Covid will make itself known artistically as a sort of shadow spectre, or perhaps, as with much of the art of the Aids pandemic, it will operate powerfully at the intersection of art and activism. The political rage is there, and if not the same degree of stigma and marginalisation faced by queer artists, the suffering of vulnerable people has been great indeed. There has been enormous grief, too. Forgive me for sounding like an armchair psychologist for a moment, but it has to come out somehow. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",0
100271,"When there’s an app that can save lives, there will be no need to download it out of a sense of duty",2020-05-31 07:00:06+00:00,Opinion,"The NHS Covid-19 alert app will be available nationwide in June. It’s voluntary, so those of us with smartphones must decide: should we download the app? The health secretary, Matt Hancock, thinks we should, claiming that we would be “doing our duty and helping to save lives”. If only it were that simple. Even if 80% of smartphone users (60% of the UK population) download the app, which is the adoption rate epidemiologists say is needed to make it work, the app won’t save lives. Our first problem is that the UK’s testing capability is too slow stop the spread of the virus. Once you’re infected, you’re contagious for two days before the onset of Covid-19 symptoms and most contagious on the first day of symptoms. To break the chain of transmission, you must alert your contacts within that narrow window of opportunity, so that they can quarantine for the 14-day incubation period and report if they too show symptoms and need testing. Yet many people struggle or are unable to get tested, and the average return time for a test result is five days – with the longest taking 13 days. If we could improve our testing capacity to meet the tight turnaround needed to alert people within the “window of opportunity”, and if we built an app that sent alerts based on a positive test result, then we might have something useful. However, the app we are being invited to download doesn’t rely on a positive test result. Instead, it asks us to self-report symptoms. This introduces several pathways to failure. The app only asks if you have two out of 14 Covid-19 symptoms recognised by the World Health Organization: fever and continuous cough. This means it may fail to account for infected people who show the other symptoms – and thus will not alert their contacts. The app may not flag up people who don’t have a fever, who account for about a third of positive cases. No self-reporting app will work for people who are infected but never show symptoms, which the US Centers for Disease Control estimates could amount to as many as 30% of cases. Only a test will detect those cases. Still, it can’t do any harm to download the app, right? Actually, no. Unless the government compels employers to pay people to quarantine for 14 days every time they receive an alert, people may feel pressured to ignore the alerts and keep working, even if that risks their health and that of their contacts. Also, not every worker is entitled to sick pay. Those are policy problems, not an app problem, but if we don’t solve them, the app won’t work and the virus will continue to spread. The app also puts our data and privacy at greater risk of an accidental breach or a cyberattack because it is based on a centralised model, which stores our data on a central server. A decentralised model, which keeps our data on our devices, minimises this risk. Most other countries have opted for a decentralised model for their app. There’s still time for the UK to change course. Most worrying of all, the government has so far denied parliament the opportunity to pass primary legislation to protect and limit the use of our data relating to using the app. Without such legislation, we risk creating a new set of problems. For instance, do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine? Do we want our employers to be able to know our Covid-19 status, or to be able to pressure us to download this “voluntary” app as a condition of returning to work?
Do we want private companies to access this data, the way they already access so much else? Can we request that our data be deleted after the pandemic or will the government retain it indefinitely, and use it however it wants? Will this app exist only for the duration of the pandemic, or could the government require it to be used as a permanent health tracker, as is already being planned in the Chinese city of Hangzhou? The answers to these questions could change our lives and the balance of power between individuals, employers and the state. Parliament must therefore scrutinise all of this and, where necessary, legislate and specify oversight and enforcement mechanisms. A contact tracing app could play a useful role in our pandemic response, but only if we set it up to succeed, not fail. If we create an app that really could help save lives, and which we could use with confidence, there will be no need to ask us to download it out of a sense of duty. We’ll want it. • Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster",0
105226,"I'm a Covid-19 'long-hauler'. For us, there is no end in sight | Jemma Kennedy",2020-07-26 06:30:16+00:00,Opinion,"As a writer, I spend my days trying to craft believable, satisfying narratives. But as a Covid-19 “long-hauler”, I have given up trying to find an internal logic to the story of my illness. As we now know, thousands of people are suffering a range of bewildering and debilitating post-Covid symptoms that don’t follow any predictable act breaks or intervals. Happily, the recent news about the emergency rescue package for the UK’s cultural industries, including my own, was followed by the NHS announcing an online Covid-19 rehab service, promising a “personalised package of aftercare”. It’s a promising start, but we are still nowhere near understanding the long-term effects of this vicious, capricious virus.
I fell sick in mid-March. My diagnosis of “mild” Covid meant that I avoided going to hospital, but still needed three trips to A&E as the illness peaked. Frustratingly, my tests revealed the “normal” blood, heart, lung and organ function typical of long-haulers. But my body told me otherwise. For six weeks, it felt as though every cell had been poisoned, accompanied by constant chest pain and shortness of breath. During May, I recovered from the worst of it, only to be felled again by a bout of post-viral fatigue that is almost as bad as the disease itself. Before falling ill, I had enjoyed a stable, long-term relationship with my body. I nourished it with good food, exercise and sleep and it did more or less what I asked it to. Now it has turned on me. My heart, which had gone quietly about its vital work, like so many NHS and care workers, has become a showgirl, nightly pirouetting on the stage of my ribs. I dread going to sleep, which usually occurs sitting up, to avoid the crushing lung pain that comes when I lie flat. Months of viral gastroenteritis have left me with mild colitis of the bowel, necessitating a strict dietary regime; my head aches, my skin prickles, my fatigue covers me like a weighted blanket stitched from dead dogs. It’s hard to resist the pull of tragedy in the absence of medical answers. Last week, I gave in and spent all day in bed howling. My husband, now required to dress, wash and partially feed me, looked at me with resigned sorrow. “I don’t know how to help you,” he said. I didn’t know either – nobody did – hence the gnawing fear and depression, an ongoing symptom in itself. Thankfully, this low point of incapacitation has eased a little. Certain things are helping; a nutrition and supplement regime, acupuncture (good but expensive) and total rest (free but not good for the self-employed). As I move from bed to sofa and back again, I learn that Gwyneth Paltrow has designed a new £58 candle that smells like her orgasm. If I had the energy I would do the same but I’m not sure it would sell; my Covid candle has top notes of gluten-free oatcakes, middle notes of humid sheets and a base note of despair. And yet compared with many others, I am doing reasonably well. I don’t have small children, dependants or live alone. And I have work lined up for when I’m physically stronger – I can at least write by using a transcription app.
Countless others, however, will struggle to manage crippling post-viral symptoms without help. We don’t yet know if post-Covid recovery is worse according to gender, ethnicity or age, but we know that those who are poor or disadvantaged socially will suffer disproportionately. Jobs will be lost, long-term care may be needed. Will long-haulers be eligible for state financial support and free specialist medical care beyond the 12 weeks offered by the NHS? Can we avoid the battle faced by chronic fatigue or ME sufferers, our closest cousins, who have historically found it difficult to a) get diagnosed, b) treated and c) recognised as even having a bona fide disease? We long-haulers are also at the mercy of the medical establishment, which has not always responded to our dilemma with sympathy. George, a friend and fellow long-hauler, fought her GP for weeks to get a chest MRI, knowing that her lungs weren’t working properly. The MRI revealed she has fibrosis – scarring – in her lungs. The potential long-term effects are sobering, as the lungs feed the other organs with oxygen. Like so many of us, she has yet to understand the impact on her future life. Those with sympathetic GPs like mine may fare better, but this virus has baffled scientific experts at every turn and it’s the same with recovery. Forget the predicted second wave of Covid-19 – we long-haulers are the second wave. And we need reassurance and help now. It cannot be left to the charity and voluntary sectors to drive research and support, as has happened with those with chronic fatigue. So the NHS programme is a good start, but the government must also pledge help and recognition of the havoc wreaked by post-Covid syndrome. Above all, it must ensure the new narratives that are emerging from the long-haul frontline are disseminated widely, particularly to the young, who have been endlessly told they are not at risk. Our stories show this to be palpably untrue – plenty of young long-haulers who were physically fit before a mild attack of the virus are now partially disabled. Our post-Covid narrative may not have an end, but as we attempt to resume normal life, grieve our dead and lick our wounds, it should act as a cautionary tale to those healthy people who believe the worst is over. For others, it may just be beginning. • Jemma Kennedy is a novelist, playwright and screenwriter",0
133690,What price human life? Overworked NHS staff have to answer this every day | Rachel Clarke,2021-10-26 15:00:05+00:00,Opinion,"A cynic, wrote Oscar Wilde, is somebody who “knows the price of everything and the value of nothing”. Nowhere do those words appear truer than in the matter of human life itself. What could be more distasteful than attaching a price tag to a person – as though their worth can be measured in pounds and pence? A human life, surely, is priceless; no amount of mere money or stuff comes close. The pandemic has destroyed such simple certainties. First, we stared in collective disbelief as Covid ravaged northern Italy. Next, we recoiled at the grotesque implications of achieving “herd immunity” by allowing the virus to race unchecked through the UK population, culling those deemed expendable by covert decree and government inaction. Quickly though, counter-narratives emerged. Lockdowns were pernicious and caused more harm than good. Economic Armageddon was deadlier than allowing older and economically unproductive people to die. The nation’s mental health mattered more than anything. This death was worth it, to avoid that one over there.
As we now approach our second winter with Covid-19, these debates – if you can call them that – have never been more poisonous. Healthcare workers in particular are subjected to slurries of hatred and abuse. Newly qualified nurses, volunteers at vaccination hubs and even children on their way to school have all been harangued in person by Covid anti-vaxxers. Perhaps the only thing anyone agrees on for certain is that we are all sick to death of the virus. Moral absolutes – such as clapping for key workers – now seem like ancient history. In this febrile context, it is easy to dismiss the current dire warnings from the NHS frontline – or to use them to push the case for privatisation. As the Telegraph’s associate editor, Camilla Tominey, puts it: “We have now locked down three times for the NHS. How many more do they need? Taxpayers are already pouring £3bn a week of their hard-earned cash into the health service … Forgive me, but what on earth have they been doing for the past six months, when the NHS hasn’t been overwhelmed by Covid?” A Times editorial goes one step further, declaring “the pandemic has intensified pressures on the service’s budgets. There is no realistic alternative to charging for treatment and extending the role of private insurance.” Confusingly, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, claims to the contrary that Covid plan B measures are not necessary since the NHS does not, apparently, face unsustainable pressures. From the perspective of NHS staff, Javid’s assertion feels like an outright denial of reality. I do not know a single colleague who thinks conditions inside the NHS right now are anything other than desperate. We are striving to address the vast backlog of care postponed due to Covid, but the truth is that the NHS has been in crisis for months now. Many hospitals – my own included – have been on black alert virtually continuously since early summer. This means that every bed in the hospital is full. Until a patient is discharged, no one new can be admitted. The knock-on effects for patients are pernicious. Paramedics are spending entire 12-hour shifts trapped on hospital forecourts, unable to hand over their sick patients to A&E. This means that some 999 calls are going unattended. Patients are dying at home or in the back of stationary ambulances, never receiving the hospital care that might have saved them. Last week, an anonymous paramedic in Cornwall said: “Imagine if we piled the bodies that have died because we have arrived too late outside the hospital next to each other so that everyone could see how badly the system is failing the public, then there would be public outcry … if they knew how many were dying needlessly then it would be on the front pages of every national newspaper.” These are “never events” in NHS parlance: these are events that fall so far short of acceptable standards of care they should not occur even once, let alone routinely. Never events are blighting cancer care too. For months, cancer operations have been intermittently cancelled due to lack of intensive care beds, but now even chemotherapy is being rationed too. Lucy Gossage, a consultant oncologist based in Nottingham, recently described her anguish at being forced to reserve chemotherapy for only those patients whose cancer is deemed curable. “Currently, we are unable to offer chemotherapy that aims to prolong life or palliate symptoms for many people with advanced cancer,” she wrote. “We hope this is very temporary, but it’s indicative of a system on its last legs.” If you are lucky enough to be brimming with health – the kind of person who rarely needs to see a GP, let alone pay a visit to hospital – all of this may feel remote and esoteric. It is very easy to turn a blind eye. In the NHS, though, we do not have that luxury. Ours is a gut-wrenching, zero-sum game in which there is absolutely no spare capacity. It does not matter that there are fewer Covid inpatients now than in January, when we are frenetically trying to deliver business as usual. Every patient in hospital with Covid takes resources away from another patient with cancer, heart disease, a stroke or sepsis. All of this highlights a fundamental truth. Human life, however much we want to pretend otherwise, most definitely has its price. We may feel squeamish voicing it out loud, but society permits some people to die because the cost to others of preventing those deaths is deemed too high. In short, we place a monetary value on human lives every day. Democratic elections simply set the parameters. The question we all need to ask as winter looms is: how much dying are we happy with? Are we OK with A&Es too full to function properly? Or with cancelled cancer surgeries and rationed chemotherapy? And if not, then what costs are we willing to incur so that these “never events” do not become routine occurrences? These are hugely difficult and uncomfortable conversations, with no glib or easy answers. It is our immense misfortune to have a prime minister who chooses to dodge rather than answer them.

106674,Local lockdowns based on arbitrary figures are punishing England's poorest | Carl Heneghan,2020-08-27 15:58:06+00:00,Opinion,"As a general practitioner, Julian Tudor Hart lived and worked in south Wales. He pioneered much of what now constitutes modern routine preventive care, seeking out those most in need. His research from the 1960s onwards in Welsh mining communities showed that medical care was often not available to those with greatest need: the most deprived in society. Today we are seeing a corollary to this with the imposition of restrictive Covid-19 lockdown measures that target the most deprived – those who can least afford to endure them. The government has now announced trial payments for some people on low incomes who must self-isolate, but more is required.
In the week ending 8 August, there were 110 positive cases of Sars-CoV-2 per 100,000 in the town of Oldham – breaking through the 50 cases threshold that puts it on the government’s “red alert” watchlist. Each week Public Health England (PHE) publishes a Covid-19 report that summarises information from the surveillance systems used to monitor the pandemic in England. Currently, 28 local authorities are on the at-risk watchlist following the weekly Local Action Committee meeting. In 18 of them, households are not allowed to mix. While weekly rates in Oldham have come down, they are still among the highest. The current watchlist is dominated by areas of deprivation: Bradford (ranked the 13th most deprived local authority in England), Blackburn with Darwen, Hyndburn, Oldham and Leicester are at the top of the watchlist. They are all in the top 10% of the most deprived areas in England.
The higher number of detected cases in these deprived areas is highly predictable. A built environment provides numerous opportunities for transmission of infection: high population density and overcrowded housing present the ideal conditions. In England, about 3% of the population live in overcrowded accommodation; this is much more prevalent among lower-income households. And while 2% of white households experienced overcrowding from 2014 to 2017, that number is much higher in ethnic minorities – it shoots up to 30% in Bangladeshi households. Oldham town has a greater proportion of minority-ethnic residents than Greater Manchester or England: one in 10 of the population is of Pakistani heritage, one in 14 of Bangladeshi heritage. These communities primarily live in the most deprived areas and have already been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The death rate among people of Bangladeshi heritage is twice that of white people even when accounting for age, sex, and levels of deprivation. The risk for other ethnic minorities is 10-50% higher than for white people. PHE’s review in June promised to discover why the infection had such an unequal effect on people of different ethnicity. However, the report has been widely criticised for mentioning nothing about what could be done to improve the situation or suggesting plans for protecting at-risk groups. Are the restrictive measures, therefore, justified? The current watchlist level is based on an arbitrary figure that does not represent how we have assessed epidemic levels of community infection in the past. An epidemic is said to occur when weekly GP consultations for new episodes of flu-like illness exceed 400 per 100,000. This figure, therefore, refers to a person who has symptoms and is presenting to healthcare. On the contrary, current PCR testing is being used as a screening tool: in affected areas, testing is on the increase due to hypervigilance and active case-finding strategies that include knocking on doors. This strategy frequently picks up asymptomatic people. The watchlist figure of 50 per 100,000, therefore, does not consider the impact of the disease. Only nine people are currently in hospital with Covid-19 across the Pennine Trust hospitals that cover Oldham, Rochdale (also on the watchlist) and North Manchester. Increased testing leads to more detection of the virus, but it has not necessarily translated into infections that cause symptomatic disease. Many of those who have tested positive would be classed as weak positives – their risk of transmitting the disease further is low. Politicians’ urge to intervene is a sign that the test-and-trace programme has failed. But restrictive interventions are often too quickly deployed. Nevertheless, there is a radical need to improve living conditions; improve access to health and social services; address the urban environmental exposures that contribute to infectious outbreaks; and rethink the social factors that cause high infection rates in deprived areas. Tudor Hart died in 2018. He is best known for his “inverse care law” that showed the availability of good medical care tends to correspond inversely with the need for it in the population served. The case for improving health outcomes in deprived populations is clear. But there is a pressing need for our politicians to think carefully before deciding what to do next and consider the wider needs of the people affected by such restrictive measures.

120046,The Observer view on emerging from Covid lockdown,2021-03-28 05:15:32+00:00,Opinion,"It will be hard for many people to suppress feelings of relief tomorrow as they enjoy the first lockdown freedoms of a spring that will hopefully lead to summer months devoid of all Covid restrictions. The country has endured a grim winter and the urge to step out and share time with friends and relatives has become increasingly intense. Such urges should be tempered with the recollection that we have been here before. Lockdowns were lifted last summer yet the virus quickly returned. The fear that it could re-emerge in a third, deadly wave cannot therefore be ignored, although two key factors should give us confidence that we are now better placed to control Covid-19 than in 2020. The first reassurance is straightforward. We can thank the remarkable success of a vaccination campaign that has seen more than 32 million people in the UK receive jabs, a programme that puts the nation on target to offer vaccines to all adults by July. And with vaccines not only warding off death and hospitalisations but also inducing reductions in virus transmissions, we can expect daily case rates to remain relatively modest. At least, that is the forecast, one that scientists will be monitoring with considerable care over coming months. The second factor is less striking but still provides comfort – for it is clear that a sense of caution now pervades the government, which seems better prepared to accept scientific advice and which appears less likely to indulge in bluster and on an insistence on the early reopening of the country at all costs. This has not always been the case, as Wellcome Trust director Jeremy Farrar made clear yesterday. As Farrar said, terrible damage was inflicted on the country when ministers recklessly refused to impose a September circuit-breaker lockdown urged on them by advisers who had become alarmed by new cases of Covid-19 soaring across the country. The end result was a jump in admissions to hospital that eventually led to a seven-week period in January and February when Covid deaths reached their highest levels of the last 12 months. People need reminding of this very dark statistic. Boris Johnson’s government may have learned its lesson but it has done so only after tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths have occurred in the UK. The current lockdown that we are only now preparing to leave could have been lifted long ago had the government demonstrated caution, listened to its advisers and acted more swiftly. Let’s hope it now sees sense. Certainly, Johnson’s rhetoric is showing some restraint at present. How long it stays that way is another matter. The country needs to remain diligent over the next few months. As we make clear elsewhere, there are genuine fears for the health of employees returning to workplaces that have not been assessed for Covid risks – at a time when our vaccination programme is still incomplete and when dangerous variants are still circulating. An example is provided by staff at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea, who are preparing to strike over safety concerns after more than 600 workers tested positive for Covid-19 in recent months. Those who continue to work at home face other problems, with one group of call centre employees having been told that webcams could be installed to monitor their activity and work levels at home. It is clear that after all our lockdowns, the route back to normality is going to be a hard one, a journey littered with problems as we try to readjust to the lifestyles we abandoned a year ago. We are going to need time, effort and support to adapt to post-Covid life in Britain – and a government that recognises the long-term nature of the problem.",0
98179,Boris Johnson must impose a lockdown now | David Lammy,2020-03-23 12:51:21+00:00,Opinion,"We are at the start of a global health crisis incomparable to any since the Spanish Flu of 1918, which killed more people than the first world war. Coronavirus is spreading silently and malignantly, from our work and social spaces, out to our homes, into shops and back again. It preys particularly on vulnerable people – those already sick, people over 70.
In the UK, by the end of Saturday, we had reported more than 5,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 233 deaths. This is almost the exact number of cases and deaths Italy reported on 7 March. Two days later, the Italian government imposed a national quarantine. Even despite these extraordinary measures, which should start having an effect this week, in its latest figures, Italy reported 59,138 cases and 5,476 deaths. Its hospitals are overflowing far beyond capacity. Military trucks are transporting dead bodies to cemeteries in the country. The grim truth is that the UK is two weeks behind Italy, following a similar trajectory, with significantly fewer hospital beds. The British government has failed to properly digest the lessons from the countries which were infected before us. We wasted precious weeks pursuing an outlier “herd immunity” strategy, which contradicted World Health Organization advice and has been criticised by many public health experts. On Friday, Boris Johnson finally, reluctantly, and reportedly only because of pressure from French president, Emmanuel Macron, closed pubs, restaurants and social spaces. But many other shops and public spaces remain open. This weekend, images of packed London parks and flower markets circulated on the internet. The prime minister has advised people to stay at home, but there are no measures to limit crowds on public transport. Lives are different, but Brits are still going out.
It is not enough. The failure to take drastic public health measures now could have a disastrous impact on our NHS in April. Nurses and doctors are already struggling to cope. Given the exponential rates at which this disease spreads, hospitals are on track to be decimated in a few weeks’ time. Unnecessary deaths will happen because our hospitals are just too full. There is no doubt those in government are working incredibly hard, under immense strain, in unprecedented times. However, a picture is emerging that a combination of complacency and British exceptionalism may have cost lives which could have been saved if we acted more boldly. Despite what decision-makers may have thought, Britain is not naturally more resilient than Italy. Johnson should also have recognised the danger emerging in London by including its mayor, Sadiq Khan, in the coronavirus Cobra meetings from the start. An examination of what went wrong in the UK government’s management in the early stages of this crisis will come at a later date. What matters now are the actions we can take to limit the numbers of coronavirus patients in the immediate future and prevent our health service from being over-run. First, Johnson should announce an urgent enforced lockdown in areas which are highly affected by the virus, including London, as has been demanded in an open letter by more than 40 of the country’s most senior scientific academics. Health interventions based on individual agency are never fully effective, as is demonstrated by decades of campaigns urging people to only drink in moderation. A regional approach to containment and travel restrictions, with strict limits on movement between areas of high and low infection, has been shown to be successful in China, which yesterday reported no new local cases for the third day running. France, another liberal democracy, has introduced its own strictly enforced lockdowns.
The urgent introduction of mass testing, alongside case isolation and contact tracing, is just as vital. As of 20 March, the UK had tested just 64,621 people for the virus. In South Korea, which has been testing up to 20,000 people per day, there has been a dramatic slowdown in infection. It was a relief last week when Johnson announced plans to increase testing to 25,000 per day, but, it is unclear when this promise will be fulfilled. We must support everyone trying to make this happen – in the NHS, in universities and research centres, in manufacturing and distribution – to speed things up. Health workers must be prioritised for tests. Without doing so, we do not know how many staff are self-isolating unnecessarily when hospitals need them. An enforced lockdown in London, and other hotspots, will rightly discomfort anyone with even the faintest liberal disposition. The freedom to move around is fundamental to our social contract. But if we continue to live as we please over the coming few weeks, the result will be thousands of unnecessary deaths. Us Londoners must be prepared to temporarily sacrifice our liberty to save lives. • David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham",0
111098,Carry On Coronavirus: why a vaccine trial has saucy potential | Tim Adams,2020-10-25 07:30:02+00:00,Opinion,"Love in a cold climate The news that the government is to fund “human challenge studies” into Covid-19, in which young, healthy volunteers will be infected with the safest possible dose and paid to be quarantined to test the efficacy of vaccines, was a reminder that this country has a unique history in such trials. The Common Cold Unit in Salisbury was set up just after the war at a former Red Cross hospital. By the time it closed in 1990, 20,000 people had taken up its offer to be dosed with cold and flu viruses and monitored for reactions. The camps were advertised as vacations: “How would you like a cheap and comfortable holiday, everything free and no expense, and even 35p a day pocket money?” one typical advert ran in 1974. “It’s true there’s a risk of catching a cold – but in a very good cause!” Much of what is known of the way coronaviruses are transmitted is a direct result of the unit’s scientific work. David Tyrrell, who ran it for 30 years, identified more than 100 strains of the common cold virus, which had been thought to be a single type of infection. Though a cure was never found, there were occasional beneficial side effects for those involved. Information given to new arrivals seemed keen to play up the Carry On potential, advising that “chatting up other volunteers in a different flat can only be by telephone or at a very long range outside”. Despite these restrictions, romances apparently blossomed; at least one viral couple returned to the cold clinic for their honeymoon. Roll of honour In the new British Library exhibition devoted to feminist protest, even the three-foot-long, sequin-encrusted tampon created by the artist Sam Dawood for the charity Bloody Good Period is upstaged by the prison poems of Sylvia Pankhurst. For nearly a century, it has remained a mystery how the suffragette managed to write a volume of poems and a five-act play in solitary confinement in Holloway with only a single slate and a piece of chalk. That mystery has been solved by her biographer, Rachel Holmes, who has catalogued and collated hundreds of perforated sheets of lavatory paper on which Pankhurst wrote with a blunted pencil. The sheets were hidden in the underwear of her prison uniform and passed to other prisoners on release. Subsequently, the papers, bundled in envelopes, travelled with Pankhurst to her final home in Ethiopia, before being archived by the British Library among a cache of her correspondence. Their preserved presence in the exhibition, Unfinished Business: The Fight for Women’s Rights, is not only testament to the extraordinary spirit and fortitude of the suffragette, but also to the disturbing resilience of rough, beige, HM prison-issue loo roll.

98940,The Guardian view on coronavirus tests: political choices have hurt the UK | Editorial,2020-04-27 18:05:43+00:00,Opinion,"The coronavirus pandemic struck the United Kingdom when its National Health Service was on its knees suffering from staff shortages and the longest waiting times ever recorded. A decade of austerity had taken a terrible toll. Yet public satisfaction in the NHS went up. This surprising gap between the NHS failures and the public’s belief in the health system seems to have been driven by the support from across the political spectrum for more funding. This probably, say researchers, started to impact on public perceptions, most notably on their optimism for the future. It would be a mistake to think the spread of Covid-19 can be checked by hope alone. The last 10 years have undermined the ability of the government to respond effectively and efficiently. As the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty told the Guardian, the “most damaging aspects of ‘austerity’ cannot and will not be undone” and represent “the fatal weakening of the community’s capacity to cope”. Even today ideology plays a bigger part in the government’s response than many insiders care to admit. A more proactive mindset might have seen the state mobilise an effort to track down those in need of a coronavirus test and offer it to them. Instead voluntarism remains the creed of the current government which opted for an online booking system for tests that was predictably overwhelmed within hours. In the coming weeks there will be an argument about whether the shutdown is more deadly than the virus. The case for lifting the current restrictions can be rooted within Conservative thought which privileges individual autonomy and the promotion of individual responsibility. Calls for these to be dogmatically pursued run in the face of evidence that the old and the poor are more vulnerable to the disease. A virus as communicable as Sars-Cov-2 means that the health of the richest is dependent on the health of the poorest. It does not make sense for at-risk working-age adults to return to jobs in which there are numerous social contacts. Having emptied Covid hospital wards, would this not just risk filling them up again? Whitehall also has to find a way of ensuring press releases are realised on the ground in the country. Before the Conservative state-shrinking began in 2010, there had been government offices of the regions which could operate between ministerial departments and the various bodies, often very local, that are charged with implementing policy. These overlapped with regional health bodies and could deliver policy around the country. It is an open question as to what coordinating body will do that today. Another aspect of Conservatism is, as Samuel Johnson opined, that “order cannot be had but by subordination”. The government has had to be pushed into saying it will be transparent about its scientific advice. It has a track record in adopting tactics to choke off critical voices. Tory ministers neutered the Health Protection Agency and brought the often loud scientists and doctors who led it to heel 10 years ago. Its successor is Public Health England, which is accountable to the health secretary, and led by a career NHS manager. Lost is an opportunity for an independent voice to speak influentially about important health matters. Ministers are about to make a series of political choices that they will undoubtedly present as a natural response to be instituted so life can rebound. These choices may be informed by science. But they will be guided by a particular political morality, which will not be as evidence based or as rational as science.",0
111710,Have hope – the UK has a track record of successful vaccine campaigns | Fiona Culley and John Tregoning,2020-11-30 13:59:54+00:00,Opinion,"The first death from Covid-19 was confirmed on 11 January 2020. In less than a year, we have not one but three promising vaccines. Subject to regulatory approval, the focus will be on the next phase: getting the frontrunner vaccines to the people who need them. The logistics of such a huge vaccination campaign are critical. From early on, while scientists were designing a vaccine and undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials, governments, pharmaceutical companies, funders and health authorities have been planning how to manufacture and deliver the vaccine to the population. The first hurdle for a mass vaccination campaign is in the manufacturing process. Not only do we need the vaccine itself; manufacturers also need enough glass vials, which will be filled in specialist facilities to ensure the vaccine remains sterile.
The next challenge is having enough doses to vaccinate as many people as possible. Initially, there will not be enough doses for the whole of the UK. The most recent information about the prioritisation of who gets the vaccine first comes from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, an independent expert group which advises the government on immunisation. The priorities combine age profiles with risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms: older people, care home staff and healthcare workers are in the top priority groups. To roll out a vaccine on a national and international scale will require maintaining supply chains for the raw materials to make vaccines, as well as materials to distribute and administer them – including syringes and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. We also need to think about how to keep the vaccine at the right temperature from factory to clinic – a “cold chain”, which poses big logistical problems, especially in countries where the electricity supply is not widespread. Different vaccines will have different requirements: one potential issue compared with existing vaccine campaigns might be the requirement for ultra-low temperature freezers for some of the vaccines. Training staff to vaccinate people will be essential, as will the huge task of coordinating people to receive the two doses of vaccines they are likely to need, all while maintaining social distance. The Royal College of General Practitioners has recently considered the logistical challenges of such a large vaccination campaign in the context of a pandemic. The good news is that we are not in entirely uncharted territory. Mass vaccination campaigns have been successfully delivered before. Smallpox, the only major human disease to be banished into history, was successfully eradicated in the late 1970s thanks to mass vaccination. More recently, a shining example of global cooperation effectively eradicated meningitis A from sub-Saharan Africa (the MenAfriVac campaign). Within a month of the MenAfriVac vaccine becoming available, 20 million people had been immunised. In the UK, too, we have ongoing experience of mass vaccination campaigns. The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, for example, was introduced in 2008 to help reduce HPV-linked cancers. By 2014, 2.3 million girls had received the vaccine and analysis shows it may protect against 90% of cervical cancers. But for the best example of a rapid and timely mass vaccination in the UK, we need look no further than our old foe, influenza. Because of the way that the influenza virus mutates, the flu vaccine needs to be given annually. It also needs to be given in quite a tight time window – between when the vaccine becomes available (about September) and the beginning of the flu season (late October). The flu jab is given to many of the same people who will be a priority for the Covid-19 vaccines – healthcare workers, older people, people with underlying risk factors for severe viral lung infection – so we can build upon existing networks as a framework to expand the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines across the UK and around the world.
It is vital to remember that vaccines are most effective when as many people as possible have them. The pandemic will not be over until the vaccine is available to everyone around the world. The UK has taken an important lead in this area, providing funding and vaccines to the Covax initiative, a programme with the explicit purpose of providing equitable and fair access for every country in the world. Domestically, the UK has maximised chances of rapid access to a successful vaccine by prepurchasing hundreds of millions of doses from different suppliers. Investment in the logistics for mass distribution, as well as new vaccine technologies and manufacturing facilities, will potentially be beneficial to increasing development and availability of other urgently needed vaccines globally, and beneficial to bio-preparedness for future pandemics. There will be tremendous challenges in delivering the vaccine. And it won’t be cheap, but it will be cheaper than the impact of a prolonged pandemic on the economy. We come at this from a place of hope. Through global collaboration, the scientific community has developed several promising vaccines; the next challenge is to administer these vaccines globally to save lives, enabling everyone to see their friends and loved ones once more. • Fiona Culley is a respiratory immunology lecturer at Imperial College London and John Tregoning is an immunology researcher also at Imperial",1
127660,"Are Covid jabs ‘Trump vaccines’? No, but I’ll call them that if it means people will take them | Arwa Mahdawi",2021-07-28 05:00:02+00:00,Opinion,"Forget Pfizer or AstraZeneca, the hottest shot this summer is the Trump vaccine. Hang on, you might cry: there is no such thing. Well, Donald Trump’s former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a woman who has always had an unusual relationship with facts – begs to differ. Sanders is running for governor of Arkansas, a state with one of the lowest Covid vaccination rates in the US. She seems to want to change that: on Sunday, she published a column explaining her reasons for getting “the Trump vaccine” and arguing that Covid vaccines are safe and effective. Are you wondering whether Sanders, a Trump sycophant, has turned over a new leaf? Is it possible she suddenly cares more about the public good than political gain? I’m afraid not. Sanders, you see, wasn’t content with using her platform simply to encourage her fellow Arkansans to get vaccinated; she also took numerous jabs at Democrats. The reason some people are scared that vaccines are not safe, according to Sanders, is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s fault. If “the left truly care about increasing the vaccination rate … they should admit they were wrong to cast doubt on Operation Warp Speed and give President Trump and his team the credit they are due,” Sanders wrote. Ah yes, of course. Vaccine hesitancy is entirely the fault of Democrats and the left! Fox News stars such as Tucker Carlson, who has spent months challenging the safety of the vaccines, have absolutely nothing to do with it. It’s incredible how some conservatives, who love preaching personal responsibility, are so quick to jump at the chance to blame others. That said, it’s important to concede that Sanders isn’t entirely wrong. We can’t blame conservatives alone for politicising the vaccines. A lot of Democrats – along with liberal media outlets such as the New York Times – curried doubt about a vaccine connected to Trump. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, said last September that New York would review Covid vaccines approved by the federal government because Trump’s “election day miracle drug” was not trustworthy. Biden and Harris said they wouldn’t take Trump’s word on the vaccine. This is something liberals need to reckon with. In the meantime, if Sanders calling the various vaccines “the Trump vaccine” results in more people getting it, I’m all for it. Heck, maybe we should introduce that strategy to different areas. The Trump Green New Deal, anyone? • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",0
92979,"The Guardian view on China and the coronavirus: scrutiny, not stigma | Editorial",2020-01-29 19:03:25+00:00,Opinion,"The coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan has shown how far and fast a disease can travel in our globalised age. It has also shown us how quickly fear, misinformation and blame can spread, only hindering the fight against the pneumonia-causing virus. The alarm is understandable. More than 6,000 cases have been confirmed, and more than 130 people have died: a public health expert at Imperial College has suggested that 100,000 may be infected already. World Health Organization officials think it is impossible to predict when the outbreak will peak. Though only a few score people outside China have been confirmed as infected, they are scattered from the US and Australia to Thailand and the UAE. In Japan and Germany, patients who have never been to China have been taken ill. The response has been dramatic. China has placed around 50 million people under lockdown in Hubei province. Villages and even housing compounds have imposed their own quarantines, and many people are simply staying at home. Neighbouring Mongolia has closed off its border with China completely and banned all public gatherings. British Airways and other airlines have halted all flights to and from mainland China. These drastic measures may have an economic impact even beyond China’s borders. Already the new year holiday has been extended, affecting factories across the country whose customers may well rely on just-in-time manufacturing. Wuhan itself is an industrial hub. At present, key questions remain unanswered. We do not know how the new coronavirus first emerged, how easily it spreads, or its fatality rate. Mild cases and shortages of diagnostic kits means that the tally of cases and deaths may be inaccurate. Until we have better answers, it is hard to judge how much of a threat this poses compared to, say, existing flu strains. Some gaps in our knowledge are inevitable when a new disease emerges. Others are likely to reflect China’s handling of the crisis, in spite of the WHO’s praise for Beijing and the dedication of scientists and medical staff. Its response has been a vast improvement on 2003, when the Sars outbreak was covered up for months. But there is little doubt the Wuhan authorities, at least, badly mishandled matters – encouraging tourism and holding a banquet for 40,000 people days after confirmation of the new coronavirus. Strikingly, the mayor of Wuhan has said he could not disclose information on the virus until authorised to do so by more senior officials. Lack of knowledge facilitated its spread. The outbreak has also exposed the limits of a health system struggling to cope under normal circumstances, and the weaknesses of a party-state which justifies its existence not through an electoral mandate, but its ability to answer basic needs. Two hospitals in Wuhan are being built from scratch, within days. Yet hospitals have had to issue appeals for masks and protective gowns. Complacency, incompetence and cover-ups are hardly unknown in democracies. But an authoritarian political culture which punishes rather than rewards transparency prevents accountability and struggles to change course. It also, perversely, encourages rumours internally and externally. Conspiracy theories are spreading, along with discrimination towards people from Wuhan within China, and Chinese people abroad, the latter reflecting old racist tropes about disease and hygiene. Such prejudices do nothing to protect health. Justified scrutiny of the official response is necessary. It must not be conflated with hostility towards people who need and deserve help and sympathy.",0
119818,"When Covid hit Britain, I was a new doctor. Here's why I didn't give up | Shaan Sahota",2021-03-29 09:00:07+00:00,Opinion,"I was eight months into my career as a doctor when the first wave of Covid-19 hit London and the hospital where I work. Before this time, as a medic, I felt powerful – not as an individual, but as one part of a formidable system. There were times when I observed my team and saw how together we seemed to acquire a superhuman mightiness. We could see your past (medical history), and use algorithms to predict the future. We had X-ray vision (and MRI, and PET, and CT). Together we could perform near miraculous feats, from transplanting hearts to dissolving pain. When the pandemic hit, surgery was cancelled at the hospital where I work and I was redeployed to critical care. There I found myself drowning in the first swell of Covid cases. I saw up-close the death of patients who would have expected many years of good health ahead of them. Not that the statistically “timely” deaths were any less painful to watch, as gasping individuals tell you that they are afraid, and all the reasons they aren’t ready to die. Working in the ICU meant I saw no one with mild disease, no one who would go home after a few days of antibiotics and observation. I met only people whose Covid had left them intubated and ventilated. The most stable patients were transferred to other hospitals, leaving those with multi-organ failure, whom we could not oxygenate. As the pandemic raged on, I struggled to cope with the deaths that I was witnessing. All of a sudden, the practice of medicine didn’t seem so powerful. Stethoscopes became an infection hazard; we needed two pairs of gloves before we could feel for a pulse. Stripped of our tools, our workforce halved by sickness and fear, we staggered on. The work felt painful and futile. Why am I doing this, I thought, and on what terms do I find it rewarding? Do I, deep down, want to care only for patients who have a chance of getting well? It was an early stage in my career to face so much death and suffering, but I know that my more experienced colleagues have also struggled. I have now seen every grade of doctor cry. And it was through the casual guidance of my senior colleagues that I began to glimpse a path through it all. One night shift, I spoke to a consultant thyroid surgeon in a halogen-lit corridor. “You seem frazzled,” she said. “You should go home.” “I’m fine. I just want to go on a ward round outside ICU. I just want to speak to one patient who’s not dying.” “That doesn’t help anyone. Tell me, who of us isn’t going to die?” It was a simple question but it jolted my perspective. That same week, a senior orthopaedic surgeon, now redeployed to the “proning team” – turning patients on to their front to alleviate acute respiratory distress – quietly threw me another lifeline. As we exchanged scrubs for civilian clothes in the ICU locker room, she said, “I went through the same thing as you in my third year, when I was attached to a neurosurgery firm. There was so little we could do, for so many of our patients.” I saw what she was telling me: this isn’t exceptional – this is the fabric of medical practice. Another colleague casually reminded me at a handover what a privilege medicine grants us, to be the one stranger in the room during these painful, private moments of existential transition. They may appear obvious, but these lessons were a revelation Once more, I was able to find strength outside of myself. These are fragments of conversations that amount to minutes, but I was able to distil them into three principles. 1) To die is not bad luck, but an inevitable result of being born. This does not make the practice of medicine futile. 2) Our job is not just to save lives, but to care for people when they are sick, and do anything we can to promote more time in health. 3) We have chosen the realm of suffering and sickness; as much as we wish (for our patient’s sake) that everything will be well, we train for the times that things aren’t right. We meet people when they are at their lowest, feeling weak and sick. That is where we will make a difference. I feel acutely what a responsibility and privilege it is to care for people when they are unwell. The practice of medicine isn’t about negating death, but valuing life – and all we can ever hope to gain is a little more time. The application of so much training, effort, resource and expertise to something so small in absolute terms is remarkable when you think about it. I could not be prouder to be a part of it.

138062,"Omicron is spreading at an alarming rate, and there's no solid evidence it's 'milder' | William Hanage",2021-12-21 10:00:10+00:00,Opinion,"Once again we have seen a new variant of the Covid virus emerge, and health officials are warily eyeing the data from around the world. With Omicron, a key question is whether infections are as severe as those caused by previous variants. Many are speculating that it could be inherently milder, especially after several preliminary reports from South Africa seemed to suggest fewer hospitalisations and less severe symptoms. In my opinion this judgment is premature. Especially in such a rapidly changing situation. Accurately estimating the severity of a new infection is a nightmare. Especially at such an early stage. However, there are some things we should keep in mind when evaluating the numbers coming in. Looking at the severity of infections in South Africa, it is important to remember differences in populations. South Africa has a younger population overall, and Covid in younger age groups has been consistently milder than in older ones. There is also the issue of time, and how long it takes for people to fall ill and get sick enough to require care, and for those numbers to be reported. We are still only a few weeks into this newest wave. Similarly, we do expect infections in a highly vaccinated population such as that of the UK to be milder overall, because vaccination is expected to protect against severe illness. However, that is little comfort to those who have been unvaccinated for various reasons, or otherwise unable to mount a robust immune response after vaccination. The surge of Omicron makes it more likely such people will be exposed. Indeed, because Omicron appears to spread even more quickly than previous variants, we need to be cautious even if breakthrough infections are only occasionally severe, because there are going to be so many breakthrough infections. The ultimate number of severe outcomes is determined by the number of opportunities the virus gets to cause them, which is the result of infectiousness. This is one reason why the Alpha variant wreaked such havoc last winter.
You cannot simply compare Omicron with Delta by adding up the numbers of cases and hospitalisations for each over a short timeframe. The numbers of Omicron cases have been growing faster – much faster – than those of Delta, and it takes time for people to become seriously ill. To accurately gauge the severity, we will need to compare the numbers of cases that end up in hospitalisation or death. Mortality is often assessed as death within 28 days of diagnosis, and Omicron was reported to the WHO less than 28 days ago. We cannot afford to wait to find out exactly how dangerous it is. There is a widespread belief that infectious diseases evolve to become less virulent, leaving many hopeful that Omicron will be less severe for everyone, regardless of age or vaccination status. This is false. Viruses do not necessarily get selected to be milder or more severe. If virulence (the severity of the disease) is not connected to transmission (the factor that makes a virus successful or not) there’s no real link between the two in most real situations. The great majority of Covid transmission occurs before people become seriously ill, and so the virus has already moved on. We should remember that Delta was actually more virulent than Alpha, which itself was more virulent than the original virus. Remember the issue with Covid has never been its virulence. It’s the number of people infected. Everyone wants to believe Omicron is milder. I would like it to be milder myself, but I am very careful to not allow what I want to colour the way I interpret the data. The growth rate of Omicron is such that even if it is milder in most cases, cases can still rapidly add up and threaten the NHS. The UK has a healthcare system already struggling with decades of underinvestment and which was teetering on the brink after months of Delta. People seem to forget that nearly 20,000 people have already died from Covid in the UK since “freedom day” in July. The virus has been much more manageable, but that attrition has not been without consequence. The most definitive estimate of severity that we can expect will come in a few weeks when the UK Health Security Agency (which has done a phenomenal job in terms of analysis in a dizzying turnaround time) reports on the comparison of the outcomes of infections with Delta and Omicron over the same time period. Before then, the South African data should start to become informative on longer-term outcomes. Very early data suggest hospitalisations in Guateng have peaked at a lower level than previous waves. But this is the first wave to have taken place in the presence of immunity of previous infection, which makes things more complicated to interpret. Epidemics of rapidly transmitting viruses are not kind to overstretched healthcare systems, especially ones that have been fighting a pandemic bear for nearly two years already. Boosters will help, but Omicron will be infecting a lot of people receiving boosters now before the doses have had time to act to prepare the immune system. This is why Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust was right, even before Omicron, to propose “vaccines plus” rather than relying solely on the jabs to preserve healthcare. Even if, and it is an exceedingly big if, Omicron is milder than Delta, that is no reason to relax. The transmission properties alone make this serious. The difference between a caress and a slap is largely in the pace with which it is given.

102878,The Guardian view of Covid-19 politics: Boris Johnson must come clean about the perils,2020-06-26 17:30:12+00:00,Opinion,"The flashes of antisocial behaviour found in mass gatherings on Bournemouth beaches, London streets and Glasgow parks ought to worry a government trying to lead the United Kingdom out of the Covid-19 lockdown. Britain is a tinderbox of inequality and, after weeks of Black Lives Matter protests, there’s simmering anger at the police. The inability of Mr Johnson to get children in England back to school this term, and the news of thousands of employees being let go from what were regarded as secure jobs, have added to a wider sense of discontent. The coercive nature of the lockdown had been eroded by the lingering anger over the Dominic Cummings affair. The heatwave then made enforcement of restrictions almost impossible. Instead of thinking about its role and the state of the UK, Downing Street has decided in England to shirk its responsibilities and shift the burden to local government. Councils are going bust as the government outsources more the responsibility for the fallout from the pandemic without adequately resourcing them. This is dangerous, and could feed into a situation over the summer months where confrontations with the police, tasked to quash local virus outbreaks, swell to such a scale that social cohesion is threatened. There’s a lack of effort to ensure that the public’s best interests are upheld in the prime minister’s messaging. The use of political rhetoric has consequences. The public did not wait for the lockdown to be lifted on 4 July, a date that looks like it was picked so newspapers could describe it as “independence day”. Instead of abiding by the current rules, people gathered in large numbers with no apparent concern for the pandemic. They may have got the impression that they could do so because Mr Johnson said he couldn’t wait to go the pub or for England to get its bustle back. People are perhaps unwilling to take steps to avoid disaster because the messaging from Mr Johnson emphasises the reopening rather than the risks. There’s a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy. The government understandably wants the country to get back to normal, but has not used the time afforded by the lockdown to chart a route out of the crisis. With no vaccine or treatment against the virus, countries can only track its spread with comprehensive testing, isolate those infected or potentially infected, and convince everyone else to take precautionary steps such as washing hands regularly and wearing face masks in crowded places. It is inexplicable, therefore, as to why the government decided to ease restrictions while daily infections are still running into four figures, there is a projected death toll of 20,000 more people by next April and a largely privatised “test, trace, isolate” system has yet to prove its effectiveness. Across the Atlantic is a cautionary tale. Confronted by the pandemic, Donald Trump’s response was to minimise it, downplaying the realities of the lockdown while bragging about what an “amazing” job he’s doing and spreading conspiracy theories. Today, almost all the surges in coronavirus cases are in Trump-voting parts of the country, which were the quickest to ease restrictions and are now having to reimpose them. The more populist a leader the less they trust their public. Mr Johnson revels in the unprincipled tyranny of his parliamentary majority. He seeks to avoid any decision for which he would have to take political responsibility and wants unequivocal answers from advisers that will protect him from criticism. But this will not foster the deeper engagement and buy-in from the public that is essential to break the pandemic’s grip on the UK. • This article was amended on 20 June 2020. An earlier version referred to a projected death toll of 20,000 by next April. The projection is for 20,000 more people by April, not 20,000 in total as an earlier version implied.",0
95372,"Amid the coronavirus lockdown, Chinese social media is full of laughter and anger | Yuan Ren",2020-02-25 11:14:35+00:00,Opinion,"In many ways, the coronavirus outbreak in China has been one big social experiment, testing the thesis: what happens when an entire country goes into hibernation for weeks? Since the outbreak was officially announced more than a month ago, less than one-third of China’s 300 million migrant workers have returned to work a fortnight after the lunar new year break; 270 million children, according to China’s official news agency, are staying home as schools remain shut throughout China. There’s strictly no congregating – or socialising – in this new world order. Many cities have banned public gatherings altogether, and official advice has been “Stay in, don’t go out unless necessary”, resulting in many empty streets. Nationwide, cinemas are closed and performances at Beijing’s top arts venues have been cancelled until April. Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million, remains in lockdown. As a result, online social activity and subcultures have bloomed, and state media has joined in too.
To begin with, it was memes showing bats in soup, or people eating the animals whole, as health authorities announced that bats may have been the source of the viral outbreak. But as celebrations for new year slowed down, hashtags such as #whattodowhenstuckathome and #learnanewskill trended on Weibo, China’s Twitter, giving life to a host of funny videos and entertainment. Recreating outdoor life indoors became a hit: a man sitting on a high chair in his living room “fishing” from his own goldfish tank; masked women dancing with doctors in Wuhan’s hospitals, reminiscent of the popular group-dancing seen in parks and public squares; Ferrero Rochers being flipped inside their box with cotton buds, a parody of the way that street food stalls cook popular octopus-ball snacks. People’s Daily made montages of the funniest clips, which also went viral on social networks. Cabin fever has meant that downloads of fitness apps such as Keep, and views of exercise videos on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) and its rival Kuaishou (or Kwai, overseas) soared. One man even reportedly ran a marathon in his flat, evidenced by the step counts he posted on social media. On the video-streaming site Bilibili, views of fitness content jumped by almost 50%. Videos of cats “cooking” – kneading dough with their paws – also gained a large following. The special restrictions seemed at first to create a burst of life online. A livestream showing the emergency construction of hospitals in Wuhan attracted millions of viewers, making stars of the tractors involved. On Weibo, each type of tractor has its own page and is ranked, with the “cement mixer” coming in at number three with 8,000 followers and the “small fork lifter” at number one with more than 40,000. The citizens of Wuhan seemed to have banded together in hard times. On 28 January, five days into the lockdown, synchronised chants of “Wuhan add oil” (a reference to car engines that functions as a rallying call), was heard across the city’s apartment blocks, pre-organised by residents’ groups on WeChat. The rally was sustained for several minutes until someone suggested that all the shouting could increase airborne transmission. But as the number of coronavirus deaths jumped and the severity of its impact became apparent, discontent brewed. Then on 7 February, doctor Li Wenliang, the “whistleblower” who first sounded the alarm of a “Sars-like” virus, died. The government’s mishandling of the situation was already facing intense scrutiny – news outlets such as Caixin published a series of in-depth analyses of the delayed response to the virus. The fact that Dr Li had been gagged by police for speaking the truth and trying to alert others led to an outpouring of anguish online. Many blamed his death on the government’s failure to provide medical workers with adequate protection. The hospital where Li died denied his death for hours after it was first reported, fuelling further resentment. The hashtag #wewantfreedomofspeech had nearly 2m views on Weibo before it was deleted. As rage erupted, censors quickly waded in, deleting posts, shutting down accounts and group discussions. Several hours after Li’s death, the social media landscape already seemed more pacified.
Many examples of “negative news” online about the outbreak have now disappeared. An article that was titled “If there were bolder media outlets, could the coronavirus outbreak have been avoided?” is inaccessible; the poplar Weibo account of the Wuhan writer Fang Fang, who wrote about what she saw in Wuhan, was shut down. While citizen journalists and news agencies continued exposing “the reality” inside Wuhan, they faced a new level of repression. A man called Fang Bin who shot scenes inside local hospitals showing body bags is thought to have been arrested. In recent weeks state media has ramped up its efforts to portray unity and boost patriotism. On the last day of lunar new year, a day after Li’s death, buildings in Beijing lit up in red with “Wuhan add oil”. Similar light displays marked the Communist party’s 70th anniversary in October last year. Today, social media is still awash with entertaining videos, many portraying acts of selflessness. A short video showing a guard at a “coronavirus test station” in a thick army coat in the blustery, snowy landscape has been viewed millions of times. Xinhua, China’s official news agency, has found its own protagonists of this blitz spirit, such as the crying guard who sits on the ground eating his lunch but jumps up seconds later “when duty calls”, or an Egyptian family who “chose” to stay in Wuhan.
A series of star-filled songs about the outbreak have added to the culture of positivity and patriotism. Jackie Chan sings on both Wuhan, are you OK? and Believe Love Will Triumph. For now, while plenty bemoan the censor’s heavier hand, government channels remain essential sources of information and updates. The truth is that most people are not interested in being controversial, and are just trying to pass the time and are happy for a morale boost. Yesterday, a friend urged me not to ask too many questions about coronavirus on WeChat, as it has become “too sensitive”. But beyond the funny memes and songs of unity, you can still find devastating personal stories – the disease has now claimed 2,592 lives in China. Long after posts are deleted, their screenshots linger: look and you can still find reposted threads and articles detailing families torn apart, and gravely sick patients unable to access treatment. • Yuan Ren is a former editor at Time Out Beijing, and has written extensively on China",0
114463,How did scientists tackle Covid so quickly? Because they pulled together | Charlotte Summers,2020-12-25 10:00:43+00:00,Opinion,"The raw numbers around Covid-19 are simply incredible when you consider that this was a disease almost no one had heard of in December 2019. At the time of writing, this year about 240,000 people in the UK have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, and more than 70,000 people have had Covid-19 listed as a cause of death on their death certificate. I began 2020 anxious about the reports emerging from Wuhan: they seemed to imply an asymptomatic transmission of a respiratory pathogen that was serious enough to put sufferers into intensive care units. I am a clinical academic with specialist training in respiratory and intensive care medicine; I also lead a research programme that focusses on the lung inflammation caused respiratory infections – to me, and others, what was being reported looked like serious trouble. In response to the emergence of Sars-CoV-2, a World Health Organization clinical characterisation study was activated on 17 January 2020, in time for the first wave of patients with Covid-19 being admitted to hospitals in England and Wales. This observational study of patients was first established in 2013 to ensure the necessary infrastructure would be available to learn about rapidly spreading novel respiratory infections when needed. The first confirmed patient with Covid-19 in the UK was reported on 31 January 2020. By early February, it was clear there was a serious problem, and the ICU where I work began preparing for what might come our way. We held our first multidisciplinary meeting to discuss how we would manage the emerging threat, with colleagues from public health, virology, microbiology and others all joining us on 12 February. At this point there had been 10 reported cases of Sars-CoV-2 in the UK. Things progressed rapidly, and March was a frantic month for the UK response to the emerging pandemic. There was concern that the situation may become so bad the UK would run out of vital equipment such as mechanical ventilators, resulting in the government launching the Ventilator Challenge, to seek out, approve and manufacture the apparatus from a wide variety of sources. Much has been written about this process, but I am certain it was needed – I wouldn’t have agreed to help the endeavour were I not. March also saw the launch of the Recovery trial. It is testament to the responsiveness of the UK research system in the face of the pandemic that by 17 March, the trial had been devised, received ethical and regulatory approval, and was ready to start recruiting patients. Since then, more than 20,000 people have participated to help us understand which therapies work for hospitalised patients with Covid-19 – a phenomenal achievement. By April we were at the peak of wave one of the pandemic, and ICUs in many areas were under significant strain. On 12 April, there were 3,301 people with Covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation in the UK. Thankfully, by August this number had reduced to fewer than 70. However, by the end of October, it had once again climbed above 1,000, where it has remained, and currently shows little sign of abating. It is clear that Covid-19 is far from done with us yet. In the autumn, data emerged suggesting that what many thought would be near-impossible had actually been achieved – multiple effective vaccines against Sars-CoV-2 had been developed in under 12 months. December 2020 has seen the beginning of what will be a massive UK vaccination programme starting with 50 NHS hospitals. Such a tumultuous and difficult period prompts you to reconsider the events and your role in them. Something in particular I have learned this year: prior to 2020, I had never written a newspaper article, appeared on TV, or even spoken to a journalist about my work. I am embarrassed to admit, I had failed to appreciate the importance of communicating science to a wider audience. The torrent of noise and misinformation during the pandemic changed my view, and persuaded me to begin trying to these explain issues more clearly. It is not always easy to grasp, but we need to plainly state why specialist healthcare staff (and not bed) availability matters, and why we need both therapies and vaccines for Covid-19 to be available to everyone, among many other issues. This year has also reinforced my view that to build global, national and local healthcare resilience requires long-term commitment and planning. For the NHS, this means we need to ensure we have the appropriate specialist staff, equipment and other infrastructure to cope with the storms that we may face – with the coronavirus and beyond. No one can honestly say the UK has sailed through 2020 without having to make hard choices and compromises we would rather not have faced – the impact of the pandemic on the provision of healthcare for people with non-Covid conditions has been, and continues to be, significant. On many occasions this year, clinicians, patients, families, policymakers and politicians have all faced having to choose the least bad option under difficult circumstances. No one has been immune to the strain of this. Most of the “wins” this year have come from preparedness and collaboration. One example of this is the amazing contribution of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to the UK’s pandemic response. It has allowed us to rapidly learn about Covid-19 by supporting recruitment to observational studies such as Isaric-4C (the WHO Covid-19 study described above), React (a Covid-19 home-testing study), and GenoMICC (a global initiative to understand critical ilness), and has offered many thousands of people the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of therapies and vaccines. This work has helped to change clinical practice across the world by delivering important research. As we head towards 2021, I once again find myself anxious about what the new year might hold. However, I am convinced that preparedness, flexibility and a commitment to collaboration are what is needed to weather the storms that we may face in the coming months and years. • Dr Charlotte Summers is a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge",1
100115,Lockdown is nothing new. We’ve been kept off the land for centuries | George Monbiot,2020-04-22 05:00:36+00:00,Opinion,"In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In his speech in Greenwich on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had “panicked” about the coronavirus, inflicting “unnecessary economic damage”. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to “buy and sell freely among each other”. But as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm. In other words, it would take up the call to open London’s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are 131 golf courses in Greater London, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to open their playing fields and extensive grounds. And it would open London’s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access. But a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land. Throughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the “ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom”. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to criminalise trespass in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland’s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam. In November last year, Johnson announced an expansion of police powers to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement. Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are on average eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people. Some young black men have the sense of living in a permanent state of partial lockdown. The government’s own assessment shows that an expansion of stop and search powers has “at best, only minimal effects on violent crime”. In fact, as a primary cause of both the 1981 and 2011 riots, the policy is likely to exacerbate it. Until 1984, police stop and search powers were exercised under the remarkably brutal 1824 Vagrancy Act. Beggars, hawkers, sex workers, Gypsies and Travellers, rough sleepers and anyone “not giving a good account of himself or herself” could be arrested and summarily sentenced to three months’ hard labour. Astonishingly, large sections of this barbaric law remain in force , and it is still sometimes used by the police against homeless people. Police powers to move people on are necessary during this pandemic. But well into the first half of the 20th century, they were used as a form of social control, securing public space for “the right sort”, while excluding “undesirables”. They were a source of great resentment in Victorian England, and commemorated in several satirical ballads, various of which had the title Move on There. One song complains that “swells” (rich and extravagant young men) could get away with anything, while those without the means to bribe the police were “collared”. Today, much of what looks like public space in our cities is in fact privately owned. Many of these pseudo-public spaces are patrolled by security guards, enforcing opaque rules. As a homeless man interviewed by the Guardian observed, most people wouldn’t notice the difference between a publicly and privately owned open space. But “to me, the difference is everything, because I’m not the sort of person they want over there”. Typically, in these places, homeless people are moved on, no music or photography is allowed, and political gatherings are banned. In some of them, the only acceptable activity appears to be spending money. There’s an interesting parallel with urban parks in the 19th century, many of which were also then privately owned. As the historian Katrina Navickas documents, the owners typically banned music and political meetings. The Salvation Army, then an extreme temperance movement, waged its wars against people enjoying themselves in any public places, sparking confrontations that sometimes turned violent. Last year, the Guardian revealed that some London housing estates were excluding children in social housing from playgrounds used by richer residents. The developers of one estate had been granted planning permission on the grounds that its playground would be available to all, after which it replaced a gate with an impenetrable hedge to shut out the poorest residents. We might look for freedom in the countryside, but for centuries it has been the scene of extreme exclusion and injustice. Here, enclosure (the seizure of land from commoners) violently deprived many people of their liberties. The labouring poor were forbidden to live in “close parishes”, where their homes were ripped down by the lords of the manor, to avoid liability for poverty relief. As a result, until the late 19th century in some places, people were crowded into filthy, dilapidated cottages sometimes an hour’s walk from the fields in which they worked, for which they were charged astounding rents.
Today, we have no right of access to 92% of England. The great majority of the accessible land is in the north-west of the country, a long way from where most people live. While in London four times as many BAME people are stopped and searched as white people, in Suffolk they are 17 times more likely to be stopped, and in Dorset, 25 times. Is it any wonder that, despite government efforts at persuasion, so few people of colour visit the countryside? For the moment, our freedoms have to be restricted. But when the lockdown ends, let’s celebrate by demanding a right to roam on open land in both cities and the countryside. Let’s have a legal definition of public space, in which peaceful use and assembly is established as a universal right. The freedom to roam is as fundamental a right as freedom of speech. When the pandemic is over, let’s make this the free nation Johnson boasts about. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",0
120725,It's not 'greed' behind the Covid vaccine success. It's state finance and the NHS | Owen Jones,2021-03-24 17:50:39+00:00,Opinion,"In desperate times, take what you can: in this instance, a glimmer of self-awareness from Boris Johnson. After boasting to his MPs that “the reason we have the vaccine success is because of capitalism, because of greed, my friends”, a voice within his head – or perhaps an alarmed WhatsApp message from an aide – demanded a prompt U-turn as he attempted to withdraw the comments. While his retreat speaks to concerns of image management, his instinctive advocacy of greed represents a fundamental belief. This is a man, after all, who boasted that nobody “stuck up for the bankers as much as I did” during his victorious bid for the Conservative leadership, and who once declared that inequality was essential to nurture “the spirit of envy” and that greed was a “valuable spur to economic activity”. However, ascribing Britain’s mass vaccination triumph to “greed” and “capitalism” is simply incorrect. As the British Medical Journal notes, the AstraZeneca vaccine “was originally discovered by Oxford’s Jenner Institute and has received more than a billion pounds of public money”. AstraZeneca was involved in trials and manufacture, but it took no financial risks: as it stated last year, “expenses to progress the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments”. The vaccine programme is being delivered successfully via our state-run National Health Service, while the country’s test-and-trace system has made “no clear impact”, despite private consultants charging up to £6,250 a day and Serco’s profits surging thanks to the £37bn programme. Indeed, greed and capitalism enter the equation as blocks to global vaccination. Countries such as India and South Africa, plus the World Health Organization, plead for patents on the intellectual property rights of vaccines to be waived to ensure immunisation is extended to low- and middle-income countries. This is not only for the benefit of the people of the global south – whose lives are as sacred as our own – but for humanity as a whole. As we have learned at considerable cost, allowing the virus to circulate increases the risk of dangerous mutations with resistance to existing vaccines. Our own government is among those blocking poorer nations from manufacturing their own versions. Here is greed in action. Johnson’s comments, however bungled on his own account, serve to highlight a common myth about capitalism. Cheerleaders of an economic system driven primarily by short-term profit – whatever the social or environmental cost – venerate it as an engine of innovation and entrepreneurial flair. That isn’t to deny that capitalism has played an often ingenious historic role: as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels noted in the Communist Manifesto, the capitalist class – having shattered a feudal system that represented a deadweight on human progress – had “accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals”. But today’s great achievements are often the ideas of the state and public sector. Our NHS is often forced to pay extortionate prices for drugs developed at huge public cost: in 2017, it spent £1bn on medicines developed with the help of public investment. This goes way beyond big pharma. The iPhone is a striking case study of public sector ingenuity: its touchscreen technology, GPS, battery, voice recognition – and indeed the internet as a whole was developed thanks to state research.
Given industrial scale tax avoidance on the part of so many large corporations, here is an argument that needs reiterating time and time again. Without much demonised state largesse, no company could profit. The state provides them with roads and other basic infrastructure, and protects their property. It educates their workforce and, through public healthcare, prevents them from becoming so sick they cannot work. When the financial sector imploded – the greatest private sector failure of our time – the state bailed it out, while the wider population was left paying the costs through slashed public services and social security payments. Other market failures piggyback off state generosity, too: such as a hopelessly fragmented privatised railway system which receives more state subsidies than in its nationalised epoch. As greed and capitalism pose a devastating threat to human life and the future of the planet – with private companies lobbying against clean air regulation to mitigate the consequences of pollution, which kills millions each year, along with critical environmental protections – Johnson was surely right to stumble. Britain’s vaccination programme should be lauded as it saves lives and paves the way for the restoration of our freedoms. But it is no vindication of either greed or capitalism: indeed, quite the reverse. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",0
123229,As an Australian I’m lucky that I got my first jab. I’m confounded why luck had to come into it | Van Badham,2021-05-31 01:25:17+00:00,Opinion,"I got my coronavirus vaccine last week. I celebrated at a favourite burger joint, slurping a milkshake as big as my head and dancing around the table to Daft Punk, even as news broke that an outbreak in my home state of Victoria foreshadowed another lockdown. Even as my needled arm began to gently throb. Missing a childhood measles vaccine almost killed me; it’s now unlikely coronavirus will have that chance. I woke up the next day with a warned-of hazy brain, a little nausea and a strong feeling I may need to gnaw my aching arm from a bear trap. Mostly, however, I felt relieved – as if the one decision I made to try my luck with eligibility, book an appointment and hop to the pop-up clinic at my local Mercure has negated a lifetime of more – ahem – questionable self-care choices.
As an Australian, I’m lucky that I got my jab. I’m also confounded why luck had to come into it. Australia is a prosperous western nation with a cohesive public healthcare system, but the Morrison Liberal government has spectacularly mismanaged the vaccine rollout, blaming supply shortages and relying on a “hermit kingdom” shut-border containment policy. Now the virus is spreading again and a local firewall of vaccinations that may limit spread of this devastating “Indian strain” isn’t built. So the political rhetoric has switched and citizens are now copping the blame for under-vaccination, government MPs deployed to fault us for our own “vaccine hesitancy”. “Vaccine hesitancy” is a term the World Health Organization uses to describe why people don’t get vaccinations when vaccines are available. In Australia, we sometimes hear about it as a potential effect of aggressive anti-vaccination campaigns. The idea is that the problematising of vaccination dissuades other people from participating in it. Vaccine hesitancy, though, is complex and context-specific. Dropping a term with strong anti-vaxx associations into the discourse around Australia’s low coronavirus vaccination rate is a sly bait-and-switch that demonises victims of the vaccination rollout failure in lieu of addressing it.
Yes, pandemic-related distress has certainly seduced increasing numbers of Australians into conspiracist beliefs – like anti-vaxxism – but these beliefs still remain marginal to the majority. Yes, there have been aggressive attempts from hard-right agitators to insist coronavirus is a hoax (it isn’t) and that vaccines are a scam (they aren’t) and something-something-government-overreach-don’t-tread-on-me (whatever). A couple of hundred people marching against lockdowns in Melbourne last week is still only a couple of hundred people in a city of 5 million and numbers are not growing from last year. If you’re still seeing anti-vaxx material online, it’s not because of a mass movement behind it. It might just be the online Russian-influence operations which have been sprung pushing such messages in the past. The reality is that Australians are overwhelmingly predisposed to embracing public health measures without complaint. Dr Aaron Martin from the University of Melbourne describes mainstream Australia more accurately as a “pragmatic” community, not bound to historical rebellious individualism that dogs American attitudes. Monash’s Prof Graeme Davison also argues that Australians habitually and consistently appreciate collective measures for public safety. His evidence? Seatbelts, breathalysers … oh, and our recently demonstrated mass compliance with mask mandates and lockdown directives. There’s further proof: 6,000 Victorians got vaccinated two weeks ago, but in the wake of the new outbreak, 15,000 Victorians were jabbed in a single day. That doesn’t sound like “hesitancy”. It sounds like they may have had the pure good luck that I did to hear Victoria’s acting premier James Merlino announce there’s “no problem” with the state’s vaccine supply.
Alas, within the Morrison government’s relentless vaccination mess lies a staggering confusion of messages, despite a whopping $40m spent on an ad campaign. Significant numbers of vaccine-eligible Australians don’t know they’re eligible or that the vaccines are now in plentiful supply. We do know people who’ve fronted clinics, been deemed ineligible and turned away, though. We know some deemed eligible can’t access the vaccine. We know “prioritised” aged care and disability sectors whose uneven vaccine supplies have alternatively delivered no doses or “abject failure”. Into this information morass stumbled the government’s hopeless PR mishandling of a scare campaign about a six-in-a-million blood clot risk from the AstraZeneca vaccine that overshadowed the coronavirus’s 20,000-in-a-million fatality rate. Is Australia really in the grip of “vaccine hesitancy” or is the national affliction “government vaccine failure, leading to total confusion”? I nurse my aching arm and the hard lump under the skin and consider that getting a coronavirus vaccine shouldn’t be a matter of luck. It should be the most base expectation of government competence, in a pragmatic, collective commitment to protecting Australia.",0
108375,The Tory revolt against new coronavirus rules shows Johnson is not secure | Simon Jenkins,2020-09-28 11:56:58+00:00,Opinion,"For rule of six read rule of 50. It is hard to believe that the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, will appease Boris Johnson and refuse this week’s amendment to the Covid lockdown bill from the Tory backbench leader Graham Brady. Brady wants parliament to be free to monitor Johnson’s six-month emergency pandemic bill of unprecedented curbs on personal liberty. He claims to have 50 Tory MPs behind him, enough to get his way. Britain cannot allow its ruler dictatorial powers for a full half year. It might be otherwise. Were Britain’s test-and-trace regime remotely operational, were its Covid “case rate” better than near random (as it is related only to testing), had the government communicated convincing evidence for social distancing, and were sufficient economic counter-measures in place, public confidence might be greater. None of this applies. Rumours that Johnson’s science advisory group, Sage, wants a two-week lockdown as a “circuit breaker” have been the last straw. On whose say-so, on what evidence, with what degree of criminal enforcement? Johnson says he could bring in the army, Trump-style. This week has seen the astonishing sight of students in Manchester and Scotland having been first allowed back to college and then at once incarcerated for some of them predictably testing positive. This has led to medieval scenes of the imprisoned having to be fed by their families through the bars. There is no information that any of these students are actually ill. Meanwhile, parliament’s bars were briefly freed – until a U-turn on Monday – from the 10pm curfew. Discipline is in chaos.
This is Johnson’s individual doing. He is not a party man. His support within the Tory hierarchy is based purely on his 2019 success in securing a Commons majority of 80. But these are not normal times. Johnson’s rating is falling. One poll at the weekend showed his popularity and that of his party falling for the first time behind Labour and its leader Keir Starmer. Johnson’s Commons base was built on Brexit-voting seats, while his popular vote showed barely any advance on Theresa May’s in 2017 – 13.9m against her 13.6m. This man is not secure. Finding a focus of power in Britain at present is hard. There are rumours of rifts between Johnson’s secretive government scientists and his popular chancellor Rishi Sunak. His powerful aide, Dominic Cummings, is toxic to both the cabinet and parliament. As happened under May, a leadership vacuum in Downing Street sees power inevitably drift towards the Commons. Brady’s amendment is hardly outrageous. It offers reassurance to the nation and thus a safety valve to Johnson. It would give parliament some steerage over a government that is now all at sea. It would give Johnson some space to breathe. He needs it. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",0
118983,We need to stop scapegoating individuals during Covid outbreaks. The virus is the villain | Van Badham,2021-02-20 19:00:41+00:00,Opinion,"In the bible, a scapegoat is one of a pair of animals employed within a ceremonial ritual to represent sin, admission and purification. One goat is slain as an offering to God. The other goat is “presented alive before the Lord”, and symbolically made to “wear” all the sins of the community, before being released into the wilderness so as to take those sins elsewhere. In Australia, in a time of pandemic, a scapegoat is some poor bastard who works in a pizza shop, forcibly recruited within a pair of media and political rituals to be demonised and ostracised for having a second job in a quarantine hotel, and personally blamed for spreading the virus. You know, that virus that is insanely contagious, rapidly mutating, has infected 110,000,000 worldwide, killed nearly 2.5 million of them, and has even been found in the unpopulated ice content of Antarctica. You might have thought that transmission and spread of the virus may have been facilitated by an intersection of everything from its virulence and suddenness, to short-falls in public health governance (America), poor public policy leadership (hello Boris Johnson!), inadequate resourcing, the physical properties of urban design, trade routes, grifting culture war campaigns run by political opportunists, an as-yet-incomplete scientific understanding of it, and the inevitable fuckups made when actual, live human beings are tasked to do anything at all. We’ve been living with this thing for a year now. These facts are on record. But if you read certain newspapers – or, if you’re only on Facebook, filled with the kind of rumour-mongering that your ex’s step-brother might half-remember from a newspaper – you’d have a firm case to make that this year of misery and mass death was all due to the dude in the pizza shop, definitely him. The Australian reported this week that “two men who became hate figures” in South Australia are trying to rebuild their lives after becoming the target of political blame for spreading the coronavirus they caught while working in a quarantine hotel. A 20-officer police taskforce was deployed to “go over” Adelaide’s Woodville Pizza Bar, watching 400 hours of CCTV footage and seizing staff members’ mobile phones. Meanwhile, denizens of social media sharpened their goat-gutting knives and speculated the pizza shop simply must have links to organised crime, drug dealing, illegal work practices, aliens from space, Bigfoot, Bill Gates and a magical poop-shovel that when deployed on an Adelaide pavement created temporal portals for the entry of nefarious airborne whales. I may have made several of these accusations up, but given the present state of Facebook, satire of this sort, alas, does not stay satire for too long. The police, of course, found nothing, two men endured public humiliation while suffering terrifying infection from a lethal virus, the pizza shop owners were “decent and law abiding” and the investigation was closed in December. The pizza shop experience was a repeat of the humiliation that ensued back in July when two teenage girls did something careless, naughty, indulgent and self-endangering by thinking rules did not apply to them, which has apparently never happened in this history of teenagers anywhere, and certainly not in Queensland. They were not only photographed, named, shamed and doxxed on the front page of newspapers, but vivisected on social media. All the while, they were not only facing police charges and serious fines but they, also, had coronavirus. Before that, there was a villain in Hobart, who disgracefully brought his infected self to work, at a time when no one knew much about the virus and, also, he had to work. There have been others – conspicuously, it’s people of colour, the working and the poor who have faced the naming and vitriol that spared whiter, richer and perhaps more Aspen-visiting vectors of infection. But there should be none. Careless individual acts are part of our risk matrix but our systems have overwhelmed them, again and again. Australia has had some physical advantages that limited the spread of the virus, our public systems were for the most part robust, state governments were prepared to weather the consequences of correct but difficult decisions, the vast majority of the population diligently followed public health guidelines, and we did not face the ravages in other countries because we also had a lot of luck. Don’t believe in luck? Say the words “Ruby Princess” into a mirror three times at midnight, I dare ya. “Scapegoat theory” holds that people seek to focus resentment on others when they themselves feel victimised and powerless, and seek a target onto which feelings of hostility can be safely displaced. Strangers mentioned in social media posts for their self-harming mistakes or compromises are handy substitutes for an invisible killer virus whose behaviour won’t be shamed or changed even if it cops a by-name bollocking in the Herald-Sun. But it’s not healthy. Not when such targeting can feed into tribal in-group/out-group discourses that morph into classism, racism or xenophobia all too quickly, especially on the internet. The fixation on individual behaviours ignores and makes silent the crucial lesson that this miserable year has to teach the world – yes, even the Americans. It’s the strength of collective systems that ultimately help us or harm us. People can be goats, that’s true. Twelve months in, we should know by now; the virus itself remains the villain here.",0
116014,The Guardian view on vaccine nationalism: think again | Editorial,2021-01-28 19:02:52+00:00,Opinion,"Crises bring out the best and worst in societies as well as individuals. The commitment, expertise and relentless efforts of scientists produced not one, but multiple vaccines, at astonishing speed. Manufacturing and distributing sufficient doses to meet global demand is an equally demanding feat. One result is the ugly and escalating row between the EU and AstraZeneca, which could see millions of doses blocked from being sent to the UK within days. The pharmaceutical firm warned last week that it would deliver only 25% of its expected supplies to the bloc in this quarter, following production problems. The aggressive tone of commission officials speaks to the domestic pressure that European leaders face. The EU has so far given only two doses per 100 residents, while the UK has delivered 11. Facing the backlash for a somewhat sluggish procurement programme, it cannot afford more delays. The legitimacy of the bloc and of individual governments are at stake, along with economic recovery. But instead of issuing threats, the EU should be working with suppliers and other governments. In essence, the commission argues that AstraZeneca made a firm commitment to deliver the doses, while the firm says it promised its “best efforts”. It is in no one’s interests to turn a contractual dispute into a political row which can be exploited by anti-EU movements. When a life-saving good is in short supply, there will always be difficult decisions to make, within and between countries. As pressing as the European shortages may feel, they are part of wider tensions. If richer nations must ration supplies, poorer ones so far have little or nothing to ration. The US has now joined the astounding number of countries which have signed up to Covax, the pooled procurement scheme designed to ensure a fairer distribution of vaccines. It hopes to deliver 2bn doses by the end of the year, with tens of millions due to be rolled out in the first quarter. Yet while countries such as the UK pat themselves on the back for their generosity in funding lower income countries, they have signed their own huge contracts with manufacturers – putting Covax further back in the queue. According to the chief executive of vaccine alliance Gavi, richer countries have ordered 800m surplus doses and have options for another 1.4bn. Britain alone has ordered 367m doses (albeit including as-yet unusable candidates) for its 67 million population. The desire to look after one’s own is understandable in both human and political terms. But to consign others to taking their chances is inhumane and short-sighted. The head of the World Health Organization said recently that we were on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure, with younger, healthier adults in richer countries being vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer ones. The emergence and rapid spread of new variants have demonstrated what global health experts warned all along: that none of us is safe until everyone is safe. Good international cooperation on vaccine policy would also boost the global economy by $9tn over the next four years, the International Monetary Fund has estimated. Richer countries should agree to share their surplus – as Norway has done – and ensure lower income countries have priority for Covax supplies. The rapid development of vaccines was possible because scientists shared knowledge, with Chinese researchers quickly publishing the genome sequence of the new coronavirus. The rest of us should learn to pull together, too.",0
115878,What can moral philosophy tell us about the Covid 'vaccine nationalism' row? | Alexis Papazoglou,2021-01-29 13:00:02+00:00,Opinion,"In normal times, a row between the EU, the UK and a private company over the timely delivery of a contract would be of interest to few apart from the two sides’ lawyers. But these are not normal times, and this is no ordinary contract. The battle over the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine raises deeper ethical questions about who deserves priority access to a life-saving drug. It’s a discussion many countries have already had in a domestic context, where a consensus hasn’t been hard to reach: priority should be given to those who are most likely to catch or die of Covid-19, and therefore stand to benefit the most from a jab. But who should be prioritised for vaccination in the global context? “Vaccine nationalism” refers to a Trumpian kind of response to the issue, demanding “My country first!” It assumes that each country is responsible for the safety and wellbeing only of those living within its territory, not abroad. This seems to be the approach of the UK government so far: if the EU has problems with the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, then tough luck. This argument finds justification in communitarianism, the philosophy that argues our identities and values are intricately linked to the communities we belong to, and therefore our moral obligations are first and foremost to those who belong to our community – in this case, our political community. But according to a different, more cosmopolitan, approach, moral responsibility doesn’t stop at a country’s borders. The value of a person’s life isn’t dependent on where they live: everyone has equal moral worth. Utilitarianism, the moral philosophy that measures the value of an act by measuring its impact on overall wellbeing, doesn’t discriminate between British, French or Brazilian wellbeing. It sees the preferential treatment of those close to us as immoral, and as an unfortunate feature of human nature. According to this framework, the UK shouldn’t prioritise its own citizens, but treat the citizens of the EU, and indeed of the rest of the world, as equally deserving of the vaccines it has secured. The most vulnerable from around the globe should, as in the domestic case, take priority. So, which of the two ethical frameworks gets it right? One way that philosophers assess ethical principles is by testing them in thought experiments. Imagine a neighbour asks you for a favour, say to help them move, and a stranger asks you the same. Would it be immoral to prioritise your neighbour? That doesn’t sound quite right. In fact, the special ties you have with your neighbour make helping them seem like a kind of obligation, one you don’t have towards a stranger. Now imagine a different scenario: your neighbour is again asking for help with moving, but a stranger is at the same time crying for help, drowning in the lake next to your house. Here your moral duty is to help the stranger, not your neighbour. Both the ethical principle that says we should always prioritise those we have ties to, as well as the one that suggests it is always wrong to do so, have their limitations. No one moral rule can capture the particularities of every ethical conundrum; each case deserves its own attention. So, what about the particular situation the UK and the EU have found themselves in? By the time the UK had vaccinated over 10% of adults, including the vast majority of over-80s, the EU had vaccinated only 2% of adults. This means the proportion of people still highly vulnerable to Covid is much greater in the EU than in the UK. Should Britain let its neighbours have some of the 100m AstraZeneca doses it has secured? Let’s consider the extreme cases. If, say, the UK had vaccinated exactly the same percentage of people as the EU, there wouldn’t be any moral demand for the UK to share its vaccines. But if the UK had managed to vaccinate all of the groups most vulnerable to Covid, while the EU was still lagging behind, there would be a good argument for the UK to allow some of its vaccines to be diverted to the EU. Doing so would almost certainly save more lives. Given the current situation, and the fact the UK is suffering one of the world’s highest number of deaths relative to population size, there is a moral argument for prioritising its people. But it’s important to keep in mind that even though the political leadership of the country is democratically accountable only to its citizens, its moral accountability doesn’t stop with them. If and when the UK finds itself in better epidemiological shape than other countries, it will be time to help them out. Alexis Papazoglou is host of the podcast The Philosopher & The News.

148514,"No masks, no free tests, low sick pay – the UK government is back in Covid denial | Frances Ryan",2022-06-28 07:00:09+00:00,Opinion,"If you’re reading this in the UK, odds are that by now you’ve had coronavirus: 7 in 10 of us have watched the dreaded red line appear. You may have been stuck in bed with it twice or even three times by now; by April 2022, England alone had recorded almost 900,000 reinfections. When the public asked to “return to normal”, I’m not sure a regular hacking cough was what they had in mind. It is an odd situation. Last week, Covid infections were reported to have soared by 43%, while hospitalisation from the virus rose by 23%. An estimated 1.7 million people in the UK tested positive over those seven days. Two million of us now have long Covid, with about two in five of those – or 826,000 people – having symptoms for at least a year. And yet, listen to Boris Johnson or his ministers and you’d be forgiven for thinking none of this was really happening. As a new coronavirus wave threatens to hit the country once again, the government appears more interested in scrapping human rights than protecting human lives. Welcome to sick man Britain: where the public are left to catch coronavirus repeatedly, and ministers pretend everything is fine. Back in February, Johnson said the government had created a plan to start “living with Covid”, but what it really did was form a plan to catch and spread Covid. After all coronavirus prevention measures were dropped on 1 April – from the legal obligation to isolate if you had Covid, to the end of most free testing – the public were left wide open to mass infection. Even hospitals were told by ministers to ditch mask mandates, though some worried trusts have defied the rules and kept them. That all precautions were pulled back just when most people’s vaccine immunity was beginning to fade, and the virus was evolving to be more transmissible, gives a hint at how little logic ministers applied. One of the biggest problems facing Britain’s attempts to quell the virus is that this government doesn’t really want to. There is hope – the number of people dying from Covid has reduced since its peak – but excessive focus on this has long hidden the fact that loss of life has never been the only thing that matters: how many people are infected with the virus matters too. A strategy that lets the virus rip through the population increases the risk we all face, be it from surges, new dangerous variants, or in developing long Covid. Fundamentally, it means accepting a reality where it is deemed normal for many of us to be (possibly severely) sick, from a virus whose long-term effects – and the effects of repeated reinfection – we still know little about. The likely longterm impact on the economy and society is similarly grim. It means more pressure on an NHS that’s already creaking under the weight of backlogs. It means sickness absences across key sectors and frontline workers, from nurses to teachers. Children missing more school. Not to mention soaring social security bills from long Covid patients who are too sick to work (the government’s solution to this appears to be turning them down for disability benefits).
There will be few greater casualties though than the 3.7 million clinically extremely vulnerable people, especially the 500,000 who are immunocompromised and can’t get much or any benefit from a booster jab. Trying to avoid the virus in a country that has forgone all safety measures means risking your life when you pop to the shops. Ministers who are content for repeated coronavirus infection to just become part of British life are content for isolation to be part of clinically vulnerable people’s. There is an alternative. Campaigners are calling on the government to reinstate free lateral flow tests, the isolation requirement for those with a positive test, and financial help such as sick pay – few rational voices could disagree. Fixing our dire sick pay rates is only becoming more pressing in a cost of living crisis that means low-paid and insecure workers are likely to feel obliged to go into work when they have Covid. We must also start a long-term investment in ventilation and air filtration that can help make schools and workplaces safer, as well as making lifesaving antiviral treatment more accessible to clinically vulnerable patients. It’s also time for a renewed public health campaign for boosters; as of this month, around a fifth of people aged 75 and over in England are yet to have a fourth Covid jab. And fiddly though it is, wearing masks in busy and enclosed spaces again is the right thing to do; just under half of Britons (48%) reported wearing a face covering when outside their home last month, down from about 95% during the January Omicron wave. After two long, tough years, no one wants to still be dealing with coronavirus. I don’t want to be writing this column. But unless we wish to sign up to getting repeatedly sick for the foreseeable future, and to the risk of long-term disability from long Covid, we are going to have to bring back low-effort protective measures to curb it. A recent public health campaign in Ireland, which encourages people to think of clinically vulnerable people in their daily interactions, shows how easy it is to do things differently. The government may want to stop thinking about coronavirus, but in doing so, it is ensuring that all of us have to think about it for a long time to come. That’s something we will surely all get sick of fast. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist",0
97658,"It takes a whole world to create a new virus, not just China | Laura Spinney",2020-03-25 15:31:29+00:00,Opinion,"When I get stressed, a patch of annoying red eczema appears on the inside of my upper right arm. The doctor gives me some cream to rub on it, but I also know that to stop it coming back I have to deal with the underlying problem. Too much information, you’re thinking, but let me make the analogy. The reason we shouldn’t call the Sars-CoV-2 virus causing global misery the “Chinese virus” is the same reason I shouldn’t blame my eczema on my upper arm: there is clearly a superficial weakness there, but the real cause lies elsewhere. All the evidence gathered to date suggests that the now notorious Chinese “wet markets” – places selling live and dead animals for human consumption – provide an opportunity for coronaviruses to jump easily from animals to people. It happened with the Sars-CoV virus in 2002-3 – which was contained before it caused a pandemic – and it has happened again with its close relative, Sars-CoV-2.
But to understand why the emergence of such zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – has accelerated in recent decades, you have to understand the forces putting those viruses in our path. They are political and economic. They have to do with the rise of industrial-scale farming concerns in China and the resulting marginalisation of millions of smallholder farmers. In order to survive, those farmers have moved into the production of more exotic species – animals that were once eaten only for subsistence. But the bigger operations have pushed the farmers out geographically too, as they have taken up more prime farming land. The smallholders have been forced closer to uncultivable zones such as forests, where bats – reservoirs for coronaviruses – lurk. The stars have aligned, and not in a good way, to channel bat viruses through intermediate mammalian hosts such as pangolins, and into humans. Even so, to play devil’s advocate for a moment, the problem could still be regarded as uniquely Chinese. But there are two reasons why that’s not true. First, with the opening up of China, its agribusiness has ceased to be wholly Chinese-owned. It is a big recipient of foreign direct investment. Second, as the American pandemic expert, David Morens, and his colleagues pointed out last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, we’ve been watching a similar drama unfold over a much longer timescale with influenza – the disease that has caused more pandemics in the history of humanity than any other. Flu viruses that infect animals, including poultry and pigs, have periodically spilled over into humans ever since we domesticated those animals millennia ago. But the factory farms that produce our food today ratchet up the virulence of those flu viruses just before they spill over. This ratcheting up has been documented in Europe, Australia and the US more than it has in poor or emerging economies, and it’s what gave rise to the last flu pandemic in 2009. The first cases of that pandemic were recorded in California, but nobody calls it the American flu – and it’s right that they don’t, if only because American farms aren’t wholly American-owned either. China, for one, has invested in them. It’s not just the industries that produce our food that are creating the conditions in which new zoonoses emerge. Logging, mining, road-building and rapid urbanisation are also contributing, and the profits from those are shared internationally too. “We have created a global, human-dominated ecosystem that serves as a playground for the emergence and host-switching of animal viruses,” wrote Morens et al. The resulting diseases are suffered locally at first, as is reflected in their names – Ebola and Zika virus diseases and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, to name just three – but the irony is that some of them, such as HIV and Covid-19, go on to become global. It’s hard not to see a terrible natural justice in that. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines on how to name diseases, which stipulated that such names should not single out particular human populations, places, animals or food. Names that commit those sins often turn out to be wrong anyway, but by the time that becomes clear the damage has already been done. Gay-related immune deficiency or Grid, the first name given to Aids, stigmatised the gay community while stymying research into how the disease affected other groups. President Trump’s labelling of Sars-CoV-2 as the “Chinese virus” is also unhelpful. At a time when the main centres of Covid-19 infection are outside China, and Americans and Europeans could be learning valuable lessons from the Chinese, he is exchanging insults with Chinese politicians who have accused him of racism and hinted – just as preposterously – that the US military brought the virus to China. The slanging match suits Trump, distracting from his mishandling of the epidemic at home, but it does the rest of us no favours.
That doesn’t mean China shouldn’t be held accountable for its shortcomings. Americans know where their weak points are – they include agricultural fairs, where pigs and humans come together – and they police them ferociously. Their infectious disease experts can detect a virus circulating in a herd and generate a vaccine to it within hours. The Chinese have got better at this lately. They now vaccinate their poultry flocks against a dangerous flu virus, H7N9, which first infected humans in 2013, for example. But nearly 20 years after Sars-CoV spilled over in a wet market, those places still appear to be a liability. Controlling that animal-human interface is obviously important, but it shouldn’t blind us to the bigger problem, which is those globalised industries. Economists use the term “tragedy of the commons” to describe a shared resource – common grazing land, say – that is spoiled by individuals acting in their own self-interest. It has been applied to the climate crisis, but as University of British Columbia geographer Luke Bergmann and his colleagues have pointed out, it doesn’t quite fit what has happened here. In the case of these industries, it would be more accurate to say that they have excluded the nearly 8 billion of us who depend on the commons from participating in their governance. Yet we are bearing the costs of their industrial exploitation, in the form of pandemic disease. We have our share of responsibility, as individuals, in the foods we choose to eat and the lifestyle choices we make generally. There are a lot of us on this planet and sustaining us is costly. But as has become increasingly clear, these industries have decoupled themselves from consumer choice; they’re driving it rather than responding to it. It’s time we took back the commons, which means voting for politicians who will hold those industries accountable, rather than ones who deflect the blame. We need leaders who understand that the treatment for this particular eruption cannot only be topical, it has to be systemic too. • Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World",0
103561,The Guardian view lifting lockdown: setting a dangerous pace | Editorial,2020-06-23 18:37:07+00:00,Opinion,"For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic gripped Britain, Boris Johnson was able on Tuesday to offer a glimpse of the “Merrie England” kind of prime minister he so longs to be. Announcing a further lifting of the lockdown that he imposed belatedly at the end of March, Mr Johnson told parliament that “our long national hibernation is coming to an end”. One backbencher cried “hallelujah” as it was announced that pubs would reopen on 4 July. The upbeat tone was understandable. The prospect of a pint in a pub, a meal in a restaurant or an overnight stay with relatives will lift spirits in a way that would have seemed inconceivable three months ago. The nation is desperate to have a haircut and exit a kind of collective purdah that, by and large, has been dutifully observed. It is also true, as the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, observed, that the risks of prolonging stringent restrictions – for the economy, schooling and mental health – were very real. But while the direction of travel is welcome, the timing is suspect. Mr Johnson is justified in saying that the pandemic now appears to be under control. But as one World Health Organization expert told Radio 4’s Today programme, this is precisely the moment at which the country needs to be “super-careful” in what it does next. Unfortunately, with this slapdash prime minister and government, therein lies the rub. It is hard to avoid a queasy sense that, in a race to head off a terrible recession, lockdown is being exited somewhat on the fly and corners are being cut. The reduction of the physical distancing rule from 2 metres to 1 metre-plus, albeit with supplementary precautions intended to mitigate the impact, was transparently driven by the desire to help the hospitality industry open up. At Tuesday’s Downing Street press conference, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, conspicuously failed to offer full-throated support for the move. There are other grey areas and hopeful assumptions. The new guidelines for pubs, which may involve registering patrons’ details and discouraging prolonged face-to-face contact, seem ambitious to say the least. Self-policing the new physical distancing regime during exuberant summer nights out will also be a mighty challenge. The danger is that the new normal will start to look too much like the old normal, at a time when Britain’s Covid-19 numbers are lower but still substantial. Another 171 deaths were reported on Tuesday. The daily number of new infections in the United Kingdom is steadily declining but still averaging over 1,000 – significantly more than France or Italy. A serious resurgence of cases this week in one part of Germany, which has handled this pandemic so much better than Britain, underlines the stakes. Test and trace, deployed to great effect in Germany, is still not properly in place in England. There are concerns over ongoing delays in processing test results. The NHS contact-tracing app, described as crucial in April by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been abandoned. Manual contact tracing is still a work in progress. According to the head of the NHS Confederation, current arrangements are “some way short of an effective system”. The consequence is that the country’s exit from lockdown in July will be a bigger gamble than it may have been at a later stage. In weighing the risks to public health of easing lockdown against the economic risks of not doing so, Mr Johnson has opted to prioritise the economy and hope his bet pays off. The prime minister said that the government’s guiding principle would be to trust people to “use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks”. As a scramble takes place to bring the test-and-trace insurance strategy up to speed, the country can only hope his faith in the public is borne out.",0
98309,Coronavirus deaths: how does Britain compare with other countries? | David Spiegelhalter,2020-04-30 13:56:56+00:00,Opinion,"At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Keir Starmer said he had added up a total of 27,241 coronavirus deaths so far, leaving the UK “possibly on track to have the worst death rate in Europe”. Is he right? Unfortunately, measuring the impact of the virus is a fiendishly complex task. It’s nothing like keeping score in a game. Starmer, as a lawyer, would know that we have to define our terms carefully. And so, assuming we want to make a comparison based on death rates, we first need to decide what a death rate is. You would think it would be easy for a bean-counting statistician to count deaths – the one certain thing (apart from taxes). But it is remarkably difficult. I have stopped taking much notice of the number given out at the daily press conferences, as it is only based on reports from hospitals, oscillates wildly around weekends, and recently included deaths that occurred a month ago. And this week the number of UK deaths jumped up by nearly 5,000 to 26,097 in one day – rather close to Starmer’s count – by retrospectively including non-hospital deaths that had tested positive for the virus. But even this is too low, as it does not include the many deaths of people who were not tested. The Office for National Statistics data on death registrations is the last word, although inevitably delayed by around 10 days, and these figures would be expected to take the current total to significantly more than 30,000. But we should be very cautious in comparing even this uncertain total with those of other countries.
Every country has different ways of recording Covid-19 deaths: the large number of untested deaths in care homes have not featured in Spain’s statistics – which, like the UK’s require a positive test result. The numbers may be useful for looking at trends, but they are not reliable indicators for comparing the absolute levels. If we were naive enough to take the counts at face value, the new figures propelled the UK past France and Spain into second place in Europe behind Italy, which is not encouraging because we are behind Italy in terms of what stage of the epidemic we are at. A more equitable metric might be Covid-19 deaths per million. Ignoring tiny countries, our current score of 388 puts us fourth, behind Belgium (632), Spain (509) and Italy (452).
But these are still deeply unreliable numbers, as it is not clear if we should just be looking at Covid-19-labelled deaths anyway. The effects of seasonal flu are not based on tests or death certificates, but at looking at the total number of deaths over the winter, seeing how many extra there are than a baseline, allowing for climate, and assuming these excess deaths were linked to flu. On average, over the last 10 years this has come to about 8,000 flu-related deaths, rising to 26,400 in 2017-2018 and 28,300 in 2014-15. Many feel that excess deaths give a truer picture of the impact of an epidemic. The latest ONS figures reveal that in the week ending 17 April, the week after Easter, around 22,500 deaths were registered in England and Wales, compared with an average of around 10,500 a week at this time of year. Nearly 9,000 of these had Covid-19 on their death certificate, but that leaves 3,000 extra deaths – more than 400 a day – essentially unaccounted for. Many of these will be indirect effects from the disrupted health service: routine treatments have been largely abandoned, A&E attendances and non-Covid-19 hospital admissions have plummeted. But, of course, people are not so interested in the numbers themselves – they want to say why they are so high, and ascribe blame. But if it’s difficult to rank this country, it’s even trickier to give reasons for our position. Covid-19 mainly harms the elderly, with the average age of deaths above 80, and its fatality rate doubles every seven years as a person ages. Italy’s population is elderly (it has a median age of 47), while Ireland’s is much younger (a median age of 37), so we would expect different effects. And Covid-19 is a disease of crowded areas – New York is rather different from Reykjavik. An obsessive comparison is being made between Norway and Sweden: Sweden’s more relaxed social distancing policies may or may not have been instrumental in their current death rate being 233 per million, compared with Norway’s 38. Even if we reach some sort of stable situation – if we can imagine it – will we ever know the direct and indirect health effects of the epidemic, taking into account reduced road accidents, the benefits of reduced pollution, the effects of recession and so on? Many studies will try to disentangle all these, but my cold, statistical approach is to wait until the end of the year, and the years after that, when we can count the excess deaths. Until then, this grim contest won’t produce any league tables we can rely on. • David Spiegelhalter is a statistician and professor of the public understanding of risk. • This article was amended on 1 & 8 May 2020. The UK has the fourth-highest number of Covid-19 deaths per million, not the third-highest number as an earlier version stated. And it is untested care home deaths which do not feature in Spain’s statistics, rather than all care home deaths.",0
142977,"The ‘zero-Covid’ approach got bad press, but it worked – and it could work again  | Laura Spinney",2022-03-28 12:22:57+00:00,Opinion,"It was the alt-history, the policy that didn’t get enacted. No-Covid, zero-Covid or elimination aimed to stamp out community transmission of Covid-19 in a given area, rather than just reduce it to “manageable” levels. Most of the world eschewed it, and it got bad press from the start. Only autocratic regimes could pull it off, one mantra went. Countries like China and ah, New Zealand and, oops, that notorious police state Davis in California. There was something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about this. Many people thought No-Covid was impossible, but the handful of places that embraced it proved them wrong. Now that some of those places are themselves shifting to a reduction or mitigation strategy, countries that opted for mitigation from the beginning are enjoying a “we told you so” moment. But No-Covid’s early champions had to shift in part because other countries let the virus rip. Even if their strategy didn’t remain the optimal one, it bought them time to prepare others. It’s important that we remember that when the next pandemic sidles along. The power of language is terrifying sometimes. We talk about pandemics “erupting” – I’ve done it myself – but sidling seems a more appropriate verb for something that grows quietly in the dark before exploding into the light. The concept of exponential growth is one we have trouble grasping, yet grasping it empowers us. It means that for a time the disease spread is limited and potentially controllable. It means that explosive growth falls off rapidly once it is deprived of fuel. And it means that not everybody has to pursue elimination for it to succeed – as long as a critical mass do.
No-Covid was dogged by problems of definition. People confused elimination with eradication, for example. Only one human disease, smallpox, has been eradicated, but plenty have been eliminated. The UK was measles-free until 2017, when partly, due to low vaccine uptake, it lost that status. Elimination is not an unattainable dream, but it does require a concerted effort. In the current pandemic, the word often applied to such efforts was “restrictions”, as if the efforts themselves deprived us of liberty. No. The virus deprives us of liberty; the efforts preserve it. That’s why nobody in Davis is complaining, 18 months into their No-Covid experiment, and why they’re puzzled other US towns haven’t followed suit. Though lockdowns might have been necessary in the beginning, because we had no other shields against the virus, they soon stopped being synonymous with elimination. Cheap mass testing plus isolation of the infected, ventilation, masking, distancing and – importantly – social and financial support for those inconvenienced by these measures, became the preferred tools, used most effectively in combination. The claim that elimination exacerbates inequality is a red herring; it doesn’t, with the right support. A circulating virus certainly does, on the other hand, by preferentially encountering gig workers, keeping kids out of school, and closing mental health clinics. It’s true that some diseases are easier to eliminate than others. Many western countries assumed that Covid would behave like flu, and decided that elimination would be too difficult. China assumed that it would behave like Sars, which it successfully beat 20 years ago. It actually behaves a bit like both, but not exactly like either. Countries tended to get the outcome they aimed for. Last June, a study in The Lancet showed that those that chose elimination over mitigation did a better job of protecting life, the economy and civil liberties – the hat-trick. But no country is an island to a highly transmissible virus – even those that are islands – and the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, combined with the rollout of vaccines that protect against severe disease and death, was bound to change the calculus. Some who favoured elimination previously now think it has outlived its usefulness. New Zealand, for example, has switched to a mitigation strategy. Epidemiologist Michael Baker expects his country’s high levels of vaccination will protect it from a wave of hospitalisations and deaths as Omicron sweeps the country. Hong Kong, which also pursued No-Covid until recently, has tragically not avoided that fate, due to its relatively low vaccination rates. The lesson from Hong Kong is not that elimination doesn’t work, it’s that you need a plan B in case the context changes. Baker and economist Donald Low, who has chronicled Hong Kong’s experience, agree that elimination was the right strategy for the first 18 months of the pandemic. Baker stands by his analysis of December 2020 that, “Elimination might be the preferred strategy for responding to new emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential and moderate to high severity, particularly while key parameters are being estimated.” What we’re learning about long Covid – or post-Covid-19 condition as the World Health Organization (WHO) now calls it – only strengthens that case, since it’s looking increasingly likely that countries that tolerated high infection rates, including the UK, are facing a sizeable burden of long-term disability. The vaccines do not stop transmission completely, and by abandoning the non-pharmaceutical interventions that do, those countries also increase the likelihood – far from trivial, as scientists highlighted again this month – that a variant more severe than Omicron or its “stealth” subvariant could arise. These emerging facts demonstrate how pointless it is to cost elimination, or any other containment strategy. How do you measure what it has saved you? In speculative fiction terms, what’s the counterfactual? The right way to respond to an unknown disease is to fix a goal and work towards it, adjusting your strategy as you learn. Because there’s another unknown in the equation, human determination, no response should be ruled out initially.

129243,"For most of the world, the pandemic is not over | Devi Sridhar",2021-08-29 14:01:58+00:00,Opinion,"The Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 is causing major problems across the world. Estimated to be at least twice as transmissible as the original virus, it is challenging the measures that governments took in 2020. Thailand and South Korea are seeing accelerating cases and deaths, after having successfully managed their epidemics last year. New Zealand and Australia find themselves in snap lockdowns. Low- and middle-income countries are struggling to keep their hospitals from collapsing. Delta has changed the game radically: it is almost like managing a whole new virus. Though, while much of the world struggles, life seems almost normal in Britain. London nightclubs are full of those partying and enjoying themselves without a care in the world. Festivals are going ahead with tens of thousands of revellers. After incessant daily media coverage, Covid-19 has fallen off the front pages, receding into the background. Observing this, it feels as if the pandemic is over for most people.
The game-changer in Britain has been vaccination. When the first vaccine trial results were reported, the efficacy was much higher than anyone expected. And early studies from Scotland indicated that the Pfizer vaccine was even effective at stopping transmission. This gave real hope for using a vaccine to suppress the virus or reach a “herd immunity” threshold at which it would stop circulating. It’s true that Delta changed the picture again. While vaccines are still incredibly effective at stopping severe illness and deaths, those who are double vaccinated can still be infected with Delta and transmit it to others. But the important metric is case-conversion: the number of Covid cases in the community that translate into hospital admissions. When the virus first emerged in China, the estimates were around 20%. Wider testing for asymptomatic cases brought this down to about 13%, and vaccines have managed to bring this down even further to 3-4%. Yet these problems pale in comparison to the devastation in countries such as Indonesia, India, Nepal, Peru and Brazil. Hospitals have collapsed in several regions, with beds only becoming available if someone dies, and oxygen shortages are causing usually preventable deaths even in younger people. In June, 30 patients in an intensive care unit in Uganda were reported to have died on one night, as oxygen supplies ran out. Thousands of people have died at home, with teams of civilian volunteers formed to help take away their bodies and support the families of those who have died. What can be done to help and support these countries? In the short term, getting medical capacity such as skilled staff, oxygen, ventilators and more beds into countries is vital. In addition, institutions such as the World Bank have been supporting countries financially to implement lockdown measures with economic support for those who can’t work. But these are again short-term measures, given that Delta will keep spreading. The larger issue is that these countries need more vaccines to be able to protect their health and social workers first, then their elderly and vulnerable groups, and finally move towards broad-scale protection of their populations. Basically, they need to replicate what the UK has done but in a context of billions of people, not millions. And they need to do this in the face of a fast-moving virus that is causing devastation by the day. The main bottleneck to achieving that right now is in the supply chain. The solution proposed by rich countries and pharmaceutical companies is a donation mechanism: rich countries pledged money and doses to an international initiative, Covax, which then distributed these across the world. Alternatively rich countries could directly donate doses to their country of choice.
As is widely recognised, this charity model has failed. Under scarcity, rich countries kept their doses and didn’t share. This is being repeated now with the decision to give booster doses (third doses) in rich countries, while poorer countries are still waiting for first jabs. And it’s not surprising – whether with previous epidemics of Ebola or swine flu, rich countries always take care of themselves first, and then turn to the rest of the world. What does this mean looking forward? It means we need to move away from the charity model towards one where regions can produce enough supply for their own populations, ideally from local manufacturing hubs. This means setting up factories in strategic locations across the world, doing the required tech transfer and human capacity investments, and being prepared to pass emergency intellectual property waivers so that manufacturing can happen without the normal patent protection. The World Bank, and richer countries, should be helping these countries to become self-sustainable, instead of remaining in the 20th-century dependency model. As we look to the rest of 2021, what is emerging is a tale of two pandemics. Rich countries are storming ahead, trying to pretend the pandemic is over. Poor countries are being forgotten, yet again, and are struggling to see how they can emerge from this year without continual loss of life and deeper devastation.

104557,"If Britain ditches overseas holidays, we can eliminate coronavirus | David Hunter and Neil Pearce",2020-07-29 11:28:23+00:00,Opinion,"Last weekend’s rapid government U-turn over travel to Spain has left both tourists and holiday companies reeling. Who can be sure of flying to any country if a quarantine can be imposed at such short notice? Arguments are now raging over whether the government acted too impulsively and failed to consider the consequences. Yet, for the most part, these all miss an essential point: that encouraging travel abroad in the middle of a pandemic makes no epidemiological sense. With every arriving overseas visitor or returning holidaymaker, the risk of bringing Covid-19 into the country increases. The government has so far justified allowing this travel because it believes community transmission of the virus in the UK is inevitable until a vaccine arrives. It is not. Great Britain and the island of Ireland are just that – islands. Other islands, such as New Zealand and Taiwan, have shown that the Covid-19 virus can be eliminated like the first Sars virus. In these countries, life is going on largely as usual with families gathering, full stands at sporting events, and internal economies almost back to normal. Shakespeare called England: “This fortress built by nature for herself against infection.” And now the Independent Sage committee (which shadows Britain’s official science advisory group) and other experts have called for a goal of zero coronavirus – elimination of the virus – rather than settling for suppression. Of course, both New Zealand and Taiwan avoided substantial “first waves” – making their tasks much easier. Both also scaled up their public health workforces to aggressively test, trace and isolate cases and their contacts. But both, even now, have mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for incoming travellers. Yes, international tourism has dried up, but it has been replaced by domestic tourism. And despite this, these countries are hardly isolated – the proportion of Taiwan’s GDP accounted for by external trade is double that of the UK and continues largely uninterrupted. Can we replicate these successes in the UK and Ireland? Ireland and Scotland had large epidemics, with the death rate per million in Ireland being fractionally higher at its peak in late April than that of the UK. But both Ireland and Scotland have brought their infection and death rates down dramatically. Last week the Republic of Ireland reported 11 Covid-19 deaths, and Northern Ireland and Scotland reported none. England and Wales’ combined populations are five times higher than the other three countries’ total, yet the number of deaths in that week was many times greater. Ireland and Scotland demonstrate that the virus can be almost fully suppressed even after a strong first wave. Can we reach beyond that to elimination? There is a technocratic objection to the word “elimination”. In infectious disease circles it usually refers to absence of community transmission in a country or region, for some substantial period (for measles, it is 12 months). Because outbreaks may still occur, many specialists prefer the concepts of infection “control” or “suppression”. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, it seems reasonable to define elimination as a preliminary, though not necessarily durable, absence of community transmission. New Zealand has had no community-transmitted cases for nearly three months (all new cases have been in quarantined arrivals from overseas). In the context of a worldwide pandemic, as Australia has found, reintroduction of the virus from abroad is an ever-present threat. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has claimed that Scotland is “not far away” from eliminating coronavirus, and a committee of Irish scientists has called on their government to adopt a policy of virus elimination. Such a goal has three major advantages over suppression: absence of transmission means no Covid-19 illnesses and deaths; life and the economy can go back to a (guarded) level of normality; and it makes a second wave in the winter much less likely. So if we want to avoid a “November nightmare” and have a relatively “normal” Christmas, a push for elimination gives us the best chance.
But is elimination achievable? We think it is – though it would require major changes to the British government’s current thinking. A bold elimination goal would require further strengthening of the test, track and isolate system with clear, transparent and spin-free reporting of its successes and failures. The release of data to local public health authorities is a welcome first step. It would entail income support for people who are asked to self-isolate, and consideration of supervised hotel accommodation for those who represent a risk to their families. It would also require abandoning the troubled air-bridge system – the deficiencies of which are becoming increasingly clear. So, for British people planning their summer holidays, it would mean replacing trips abroad with UK travel. Of course, international airlines will need subsidies to avoid bankruptcy; it would also mean that lorries arriving in the UK would be driven to their destinations by British drivers. All this is a big ask. But the prize is huge. It would mean a relatively normal internal economy, with domestic tourists replacing international ones. The prize is getting children back to school; releasing our aged population from home isolation or confinement in care homes; protecting our black and minority-ethnic communities; revitalising the arts and sport. And a reduction in the probability of a second wave in the winter, crippling the NHS and requiring a second national lockdown. We all hope one or more vaccines will work and be relatively free of side-effects, but experience shows we cannot assume such a vaccine will be widely available any time soon. Compared to the costs, the benefits are huge. This prize is within our grasp. It’s up to our politicians to change course and seize it. • David Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford; Neil Pearce is professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine",0
99399,The coronavirus crisis has exposed China's long history of racism | Hsiao-Hung Pai,2020-04-25 08:00:40+00:00,Opinion,"“Clean up the foreign trash!”. “Don’t turn our hometown into an international rubbish dump.” “This is China, not Nigeria!” Resembling the anti-migrant racist hatred you frequently see on UK social media, these are just a few examples of countless anti-African rants from Weibo users in China in a surge of popular racism over the past month. Despite the huge amount of censorship on China’s social media, none of these posts have been removed. Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa have become the primary target of suspicion, racial discrimination and abuse amid public fear of a second wave of Covid-19. And this intolerance has peaked in Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people in the highly industrialised Guangdong province. It started with the local government in Guangzhou implementing surveillance, conducting compulsory testing and enforcing a 14-day quarantine for all African nationals – even if they had earlier been tested negative and hadn’t recently travelled outside China. In Yuexiu district, the largest African migrant community in China, many Africans were evicted by landlords – despite having paid their rents – and left to sleep rough on the streets.
In an echo of apartheid South Africa or segregation-era United States, a colour bar was imposed across the city: Africans were refused entry by hospitals, hotels, supermarkets, shops and food outlets. At one hospital, even a pregnant woman was denied access. In a department store, an African woman was stopped at the entrance while her white friend was allowed in. In a McDonald’s restaurant, a notice was put up saying “black people cannot come in”. The widespread racism has caused a huge public outcry across Africa, shared on social media under the hashtag #ChinaMustExplain. YouTuber Wode Maya, who has lived in China and is a fluent Mandarin speaker, urges fellow Africans to “wake up to what’s happening”. The global African diaspora has put pressure on African embassies and institutions to act. Last weekend the Kenyan government announced plans to allow its citizens stranded in China to be evacuated. The official Chinese responses were at first silence or denial. State media such as Global Times and Xinhua failed to report the story in the first few days after the news broke in African news outlets. Later, the Chinese authorities began to recognise the reports of racism as “reasonable concerns”, though migrants continue to feel unsafe. To outsiders, this horrendous racism may appear “unprecedented”. But ethnic minorities in China would find it all too familiar. In Shaoguan, not far from Guangzhou, the racist murder of two Uighur workers in 2009 triggered a series of events, such as the Ürümqi Incident, which led to further repression in the north-western region of Xinjiang. The ideology of “race” in China goes back a long way. In the late 19th century, Qing imperial reformers searched for an “answer” that could revive China in face of European and Japanese colonialist expansion. “Race”, “nation” and nationalism have since been embedded into Chinese republicanism in the early 20th century, and then into the establishment of the Chinese Communist party.
Nationalism has taken deeper root in the four decades since Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms. National revival has been a key ideological driver behind modernisation. Today, assimilationism is at the centre of the concept of nation. Minzu, a key term used interchangeably for both ethnic group and nationality, refers to a group of common descent, with a distinct culture and territory. In 2012, Xi Jinping began his rule by saying: “The China dream gathers Chinese aspirations and wishes for generations and manifests the interests of the whole Chinese nation (zhonghua minzu) …” The “China dream” became the political-economic programme for “the realisation of the great revival of the Chinese nation”. This century is the “Chinese century”, Xi said. His multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative was launched in 2013 as a massive global investment programme. From 2013 to 2018, the Chinese state invested nearly $614bnin developing countries. China’s foreign investment campaign is seen by some in Africa as colonialism, as the nations involved risk losing control of their essential infrastructure and natural resources, with their debt burden increased. China now holds 14% of the total debt stock in sub-Saharan Africa and has become the largest owner of public debt in Africa. China’s growing presence brought with it labour migration from African countries from the late 1990s. People from Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and other west African countries came for work opportunities, mostly in the metropolis of Guangzhou. Many work in the city’s wholesale markets as other types of employment, including factory work, are closed to them. It’s commonly said by them that Africans are often “accepted as traders but discriminated against as people”. There are currently more than 15,000 African migrants with formal immigration status living in Guangzhou. Although China has the lowest immigration in the world (migrants account for just 0.07% of the population), the authorities impose harsh “migrant management”. African migrants can often be criminalised in a similar way to the internal migrants from the countryside. Apart from immigration checks and crackdowns, the authorities consistently discourage migrants from living in certain neighbourhoods. There is no legal protection against racial discrimination. The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted this longstanding anti-African racism. With all the damage this pandemic has done to the economy and people’s livelihoods, scapegoating and hostility towards an imagined outside threat clearly helps to divert domestic frustration away from the ruling elite – a trend we are all seeing worldwide. As Asian communities in Europe and the United States become victims of racism during this pandemic, Africans in China are crying out, “We are not the virus!” To resist racism, we need to see it for what it is, wherever it occurs. • Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and the author of Scattered Sand: The Story of China’s Rural Migrants",0
97424,Can we trust the Oxford study on Covid-19 infections? | Adam Kucharski,2020-03-26 14:32:33+00:00,Opinion,"Earlier this month, the MSc students I teach at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ran an outbreak investigation as part of their epidemiology assessment. They were told several people had fallen ill, and it was their job to piece together various fragments of information – about symptoms, timings and locations – to work out what might have happened. We face the same challenge with every outbreak: we never have a single perfect dataset early on. Instead, we have to combine the information we do have to work out what might really be happening. This week, a preliminary study from a team at the University of Oxford gained a lot of media attention, with headlines suggesting it implied the majority of people in the UK might have already been infected with Covid-19. Few would dispute that there are more cases in the UK than already reported; our group recently published a rough analysis that suggested only 5–7% of people who’ve fallen ill with Covid-19 have been recorded as confirmed cases in the UK data. But how plausible is it that there have been millions of infections out there that were very mild (or symptomless) and went undetected? First, let’s look at what the Oxford team actually did. Its analysis focused on deaths in the UK and Italy. If we view the data in isolation, there are several scenarios that could potentially be consistent with the observed pattern of deaths. Perhaps there are lots of infections and a low severity. Or fewer infections and a higher severity. The Oxford researchers suggested there were multiple scenarios that could explain the deaths reported in the UK, including those in which there have been a huge number of infections that haven’t been detected. The media picked up on the most extreme of these scenarios, which implied the majority of the UK had already been infected. But remember, this analysis focused solely on deaths – and that’s not the only data we have for Covid-19. There are now several datasets that suggest many infections come with symptoms, particularly in older groups, and hence it is less likely that there are vast numbers of infections going undetected. Such datasets include testing on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, testing of passengers on evacuation flights, the age pattern of Covid-19 cases, and infections detected among contacts of cases. Based on these studies, it seems about 20–80% of people infected with Covid-19 could show symptoms. If this range turns out to be correct – and we combine it with our estimate that one in 15 people with symptoms are being reported – it would mean that hundreds of thousands of people in the UK have probably been infected with Covid-19 already, but not tens of millions. Of course, all these early studies have limitations in how the data was collected and what groups were being studied. To understand how much infection there has actually been, what we need are studies that collect blood samples from the wider population and test for previous exposure to Covid-19. As it happens, this was the key point made by the Oxford researchers in their paper, and it’s one I fully agree with.
There is growing evidence that, on average, people who show Covid-19 symptoms have a 1–1.5% risk of death. This has been estimated in studies of data from Wuhan, early international cases, and the Diamond Princess (with data adjusted to account for the older age of the cruise ship passengers). But this 1–1.5% risk just tells us what happens to people who have clear symptoms. If, as the above studies suggest, only 20–80% of infections come with symptoms, it would mean that for every 100,000 people who get infected with Covid-19, we would expect somewhere in the region of 200–1,200 deaths (ie between 100,000 x 20% x 1% and 100,000 x 80% x 1.5%). We still don’t know the exact risk, and we won’t until we have the results from a large-scale analysis of blood samples. But the early pieces of information we do have suggest that this is an infection that can cause a large amount of severe disease, and the majority of the UK population are still susceptible to it. Until we have evidence to the contrary, this is the scenario we have to plan for. • Adam Kucharski an epidemiologist and the author of The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop",0
110896,"Statistical illiteracy isn't a niche problem. During a pandemic, it can be fatal | Carlo Rovelli",2020-10-26 08:00:17+00:00,Opinion,"In the institute where I used to work a few years ago, a rare non-infectious illness hit five colleagues in quick succession. There was a sense of alarm, and a hunt for the cause of the problem. In the past the building had been used as a biology lab, so we thought that there might be some sort of chemical contamination, but nothing was found. The level of apprehension grew. Some looked for work elsewhere. One evening, at a dinner party, I mentioned these events to a friend who is a mathematician, and he burst out laughing. “There are 400 tiles on the floor of this room; if I throw 100 grains of rice into the air, will I find,” he asked us, “five grains on any one tile?” We replied in the negative: there was only one grain for every four tiles: not enough to have five on a single tile. We were wrong. We tried numerous times, actually throwing the rice, and there was always a tile with two, three, four, even five or more grains on it. Why? Why would grains “flung randomly” not arrange themselves into good order, equidistant from each other? Because they land, precisely, by chance, and there are always disorderly grains that fall on tiles where others have already gathered. Suddenly the strange case of the five ill colleagues seemed very different. Five grains of rice falling on the same tile does not mean that the tile possesses some kind of “rice-attracting” force. Five people falling ill in a workplace did not mean that it must be contaminated. The institute where I worked was part of a university. We, know-all professors, had fallen into a gross statistical error. We had become convinced that the “above average” number of sick people required an explanation. Some had even gone elsewhere, changing jobs for no good reason. Life is full of stories such as this. Insufficient understanding of statistics is widespread. The current pandemic has forced us all to engage in probabilistic reasoning, from governments having to recommend behaviour on the basis of statistical predictions, to people estimating the probability of catching the virus while taking part in common activities. Our extensive statistical illiteracy is today particularly dangerous. We use probabilistic reasoning every day, and most of us have a vague understanding of averages, variability and correlations. But we use them in an approximate fashion, often making errors. Statistics sharpen and refine these notions, giving them a precise definition, allowing us to reliably evaluate, for instance, whether a medicine or a building is dangerous or not. Society would gain significant advantages if children were taught the fundamental ideas of probability theory and statistics: in simple form in primary school, and in greater depth in secondary school. Reasoning of a probabilistic or statistical kind is a potent tool of evaluation and analysis. Not to have it at our disposal leaves us defenceless. To be unclear about notions such as mean, variance, fluctuations and correlations is like not knowing how to do multiplication or division. This lack of familiarity with statistics leads many to confuse probability with imprecision. Early during the pandemic, scientists mapping and modelling the spread of the virus in the UK were criticised for estimating rather than accurately depicting how severe the virus might be. Criticisms of their “dodgy predictions” proceeded from a misunderstanding: dealing in uncertainty is exactly why statistics is helpful. Without probability and statistics, we would not have anything like the efficacy of modern medicine, quantum mechanics, weather forecasts or sociology. To take a couple of random but significant examples, it was thanks to statistics that we were able to understand that smoking is bad for us, and that asbestos kills. In fact, without knowing how to deal with probability, we would be without experimental science in its entirety, from chemistry to astronomy. We would have very little idea about how atoms, societies and galaxies operate. What is probability? A traditional definition is based on “frequency”: if I roll a die many times, one-sixth of these times the number one will show; hence I say that the probability of rolling a one is 1/6. An alternative understanding of probability is as a “propensity”. A radioactive atom, physicists say, has a “propensity” to decay during the next half an hour, which is evaluated by expressing the probability that this could happen. In the 1930s, the philosopher and mathematician Bruno de Finetti introduced an idea that proved to be the key to understanding probability: probability does not refer to the system as such (the dice, the decaying atom, tomorrow’s weather), but to the knowledge that I have about this system. If I claim that the probability of rain tomorrow is high, I am characterising my own degree of ignorance of the state of the atmosphere. We know many things, but there is a great deal more that we don’t know. We don’t know whom we will encounter tomorrow in the street, we don’t know the causes of many illnesses, we don’t know the ultimate physical laws that govern the universe, we don’t know who will win the next election, we don’t know if there will be an earthquake tomorrow. If I catch the virus, I do not know if I will survive. But lack of complete knowledge does not mean that we know nothing, and statistics is the powerful tool that guides us when we do not have complete knowledge, which is to say: virtually always. Death rates, case rates and R numbers are now a feature of everyday news coverage. A better understanding of statistics and probability would help us all not only to better understand what we know of the pandemic, but also to take wiser decisions, for instance in balancing risks and evaluating whether certain behaviours are safe. There is no certainly safe behaviour, nor a certain way to get ill. In this uncertain world, it is foolish to ask for absolute certainty. Whoever boasts of being certain is usually the least reliable. But this doesn’t mean either that we are in the dark. Between certainty and complete uncertainty there is a precious intermediate space – and it is in this intermediate space that our lives and our decisions unfold. • Carlo Rovelli is a physicist and bestselling author.

114189,I'm a consultant in infectious diseases. 'Long Covid' is anything but a mild illness | Joanna Herman,2020-12-27 14:06:41+00:00,Opinion,"With the excitement of the Covid vaccine’s arrival, it may be easy to forget and ignore those of us with “long Covid”, who are struggling to reclaim our previous, pre-viral lives and continue to live with debilitating symptoms. Even when the NHS has managed the herculean task of vaccinating the nation, Covid-19 and the new mutant variants of the virus will continue to circulate, leaving more people at risk of long Covid. Data from a King’s College London study in September suggested as many as 60,000 people in the UK could be affected, but the latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics suggest it could be much higher. I was acutely ill in March, though – like many people with long Covid – mine was defined as a “mild” case not requiring admission to hospital. Nine months on, I am seriously debilitated, with crashing post-exertional fatigue, often associated with chest pains. On bad days, my brain feels like it doesn’t want to function, even a conversation can be too much. I have no risk factors, I’m in my 50s, and have always been fit, but remain too unwell to work – ironically as a consultant in infectious diseases. Watching the pandemic unfold from the sidelines when I should have been working in the thick of it has only added to the frustration of my protracted illness. My acute symptoms were over within 12 days, and I presumed I’d be back at work the following week. How wrong I was. In the following weeks I developed dramatic hair loss (similar to that post pregnancy) and continued to feel fatigued, usually falling asleep in the afternoon. I tried to steadily increase the amount I was exercising – but suddenly in mid-June I started to experience severe post-exertional fatigue. It could happen on a short walk or it could be while cooking dinner. It was completely unpredictable. When I felt really terrible, I would get chest pains, which I’d not had during my initial illness, and my body seems to need intense rest – and a lot of it. Graded exercise, an approach that has been used to manage patients with other post-viral fatigue, wasn’t working; in fact it seemed to be detrimental and could leave me floored for days. The one thing I realised early on was that pacing was vital.
For months it seemed there was no recognition of what was happening to so many of us, with numerous anecdotal reports of people being dismissed as anxious, depressed or histrionic. It felt as if we had been left in limbo, not followed up because we weren’t ill enough initially to be treated in hospital, but most without appropriate medical care and support for the duration of their illness. I am fortunate to have an excellent GP who has been extremely supportive throughout, but I could hear her frustration at the lack of anything concrete to offer or refer me to. In May, with no resource to turn to, I set up a long Covid yoga group (I am also a yoga teacher) for others I knew who were similarly affected. I focused on particular exercises to help them relearn how to access their lungs and breathe again. Much about this novel virus remains unknown, and we are all learning as the pandemic continues to unfold. With its myriad symptoms and presentations, Covid represents a major challenge to the compartmentalised specialist services that hospitals have become. But one thing has been evident for some time: this is not a straightforward post-viral syndrome, and requires a different approach. The announcement in October of £10m funding for clinics offering help for long Covid couldn’t have come soon enough. And then the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) updated guidance on “post-Covid syndrome” (as long Covid will now be known), including a definition, as well as plans for the 40 clinics across England. These clinics will bring physicians and therapists together to “provide joined-up care for physical and mental health”, and will include physical, cognitive and psychological assessment. I am yet to be seen by a physiotherapist, but who’d have thought the perching stool sourced by an occupational therapist for my elderly mother would become a necessity for me to cook dinner and brush my teeth?
There will also be allocated funding from the National Institute for Health Research for much-needed investigations into the mechanisms behind the long Covid symptoms. It is vital that long Covid is quantified and monitored in the same way we have been doing for hospital admissions and deaths. Additionally, there must be easy access to social services for people who need a care package because they can’t feed or wash themselves, as well as financial support and employment advice. Crucially, like many multi-disciplinary teams for chronic conditions, there should be a single point of contact with a nurse specialist who coordinates different team members, and helps direct access to other services. A comprehensive one-stop shop is vital for people who can’t manage multiple visits to different specialists. It may be enough for some that they are simply listened to, and it is understood that they are not fabricating their symptoms. We also need to cease classifying all cases that were not admitted to hospital as “mild”. Those experiencing long Covid have anything but a mild disease. At last it seems that those of us with this debilitating condition are gaining the recognition and support we have been crying out for. We are only just acknowledging the potential of this virus to have devastating and life-changing consequences months after the acute symptoms. That at least is a good start.

122155,Vaccine hoarding is all the more disturbing as a Covid disaster unfolds in India  | Gaby Hinsliff,2021-04-26 13:55:29+00:00,Opinion,"The idea that nobody is protected until everyone’s protected has become something of a pandemic cliche lately. Yet that doesn’t make it any less true, clinically or morally. As long as the virus is rife in any country, it could always mutate and spread again. What is only now becoming obvious, however, is that as long as others are experiencing horrors on the scale of India, consciences everywhere will be troubled. The harrowing scenes unfolding nightly on our television screens are what Britain feared but ultimately did not have to suffer: hospitals running out of oxygen, people dying in the street for lack of a bed, families forced to bury the dead in their gardens as crematoriums were overwhelmed. India’s tragedy is a stark reminder of Britain’s own relative good fortune, hard as this year has been for many. But to be lucky is a morally queasy, guilty thing. The success of Britain’s vaccination programme, with half the country having had at least one shot and the NHS hoping to start calling up thirtysomethings soon, remains an amazingly heroic effort. But it does not sit right that India, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of vaccines, should have entered the gates of Covid hell with fewer than 10% of its population jabbed. For the many Britons with family ties to India, these are deeply anxious times. At the weekend, it emerged that a Downing Street aide had tested positive for Covid after travelling to India, prompting alarmist headlines about how he might have spread a new variant through Whitehall. But arguably the more troubling aspect was that he was reportedly sent out to try to get more Indian-manufactured doses of vaccine for Britain, at a time when the Indian government – for reasons now all too distressingly obvious – was seeking to hold back many of the doses it was previously exporting in their millions, many destined for developing countries. The British mission apparently left empty-handed, but one is left wondering uncomfortably if it was even right to try. How can it not ultimately backfire on the richest countries if they’re seen to be snaffling up more than their share of resources yet again? In a sense, this tangled web of global guilt and resentment is nothing new. That some countries have ordered more vaccines than they can use, while others served by the Covax initiative to procure vaccines for developing nations may have to wait until 2024 to reach mass immunisation, is no more or less fair than the way British households throw away an estimated 4.5m tonnes of perfectly edible food every year while millions worldwide go hungry. It’s no more or less fair than the way the richest 10% of the world’s population (that’s anyone earning more than £27,000 in Britain) account for over its half of carbon emissions while the poorest end up on the sharp end of the climate crisis. If Boris Johnson had, once the over-50s were safely jabbed, asked younger British people to wait a few months so doses could be either diverted to countries lagging behind or retained by producer countries in need, he’d probably have faced protests in the streets and on his own backbenches. Look after your own, people would have said: charity begins at home. The more sophisticated version of this would have been that it’s all very sad, but that India’s problems actually flow from its prime minister Narendra Modi’s overconfidence in judging the epidemic more or less over back in March; not our fault. It’s true Modi has much to answer for. But still there is something disturbing about the fact that India is on track for up to half a million cases a day on some projections, while Britons young enough to have practically zero chance of dying from Covid get vaccinated. I was one of them, a week ago, and remain unbelievably grateful for it. But as a healthy fortysomething woman, I am also uncomfortably aware that I probably wasn’t at high risk; that only a geographical accident of birth makes me this lucky. Thankfully foreign governments worldwide are now offering oxygen, ventilators, testing kits and drugs to India in its hour of need. But that doesn’t solve harder questions about the hoarding of vaccines, raw materials and patent rights in the west, or the fact that Covax clearly isn’t working as fast as it should. It doesn’t change the fact that nobody is safe until everyone is safe; that nobody really sleeps easy until everybody does. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",0
131789,Why can’t we tackle Covid and climate heating? Nationalism and stupidity | Nick Cohen,2021-09-25 18:00:02+00:00,Opinion,"Even if you think humans are nothing more than a selfish, tribal species who care little for anyone beyond our clans and ourselves, the failure to vaccinate the world remains astonishing. It is not only a moral affront that rich nations are leaving millions to die needless deaths but an assault on our own self-interest. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the world economy risks losing $4.5tn (£3.3tn) by 2025 if Covid-19 spreads unchecked. Gordon Brown, the World Health Organization’s new ambassador for global health financing, tells me the cost of supplying enough vaccines to inoculate all poor nations is about £70bn. In countries with rudimentary health services the usual problems of delivery remain, but no one doubts that trillions of dollars could be unlocked by the spending of a sum that is trifling in comparison. Yet the rich world won’t spend. Nor will it act to squash the small risk that the virus will mutate into a variant that can evade vaccines. Covid has torn up our lives and haunted our dreams. If you live in the UK or US, you are fortunate if you do not know someone who has died from the virus. Yet, when faced with a peril everyone acknowledges, whose consequences are devastating, the world cannot act. If the response to the pandemic is a guide, the grand promises governments are making to prevent climate catastrophe will come to little. If they cannot take seriously an immediate danger staring them in the face, how will they manage to take sustained and expensive countermeasures against climate change that require sacrifices and commitments over decades? When I asked Brown to explain the failure, he replied with admirable brevity: “Nationalism and stupidity.” The nationalism is honeyed over by supposed progressives. Last week, Joe Biden hosted a Covid summit where he announced he would donate an extra 500m vaccines to middle- and low-income countries. He sounded impressive. But so did President Emmanuel Macron in 2020 when he said we should not tolerate “a two-speed world where only the richer can protect themselves”. Every leader in the west has said much the same. Notwithstanding their fine sentiments, less than 2% of the population of low-income countries has received even one dose. Everyone suspects that rich countries are paying for sweetheart deals with vaccine manufacturers. Officials at the WHO-led Gavi alliance, which is trying to buy vaccines for poor countries, tell me manufacturers won’t say where their orders are in the queue or whether they would consider giving them priority. For all the cooing and kind words, promises from Biden and his counterparts cannot be believed. As the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said last week, the triumph of science in producing vaccines had been undone by “lack of political will, selfishness and mistrust”. What he called the “obscenity” of rich world indifference comes in two parts. First, promised deliveries of vaccines to the poor world have never arrived. Oxford University data analysts found the UK had delivered less than 7% of the vaccines it has promised developing countries. Overall, of the 554m doses promised by the richest nations, only 90.8m, or 16%, had reached their destination. Those that did came in dribs and drabs, making planning vaccination campaigns impossible. Arguments about whether it is right for rich countries to engage in medically dubious initiatives to vaccinate teenagers or give booster jabs to the vulnerable are almost beside the point. By February 2022, 15bn doses will have been produced: more than enough to vaccinate the world. Governments, however, have allowed neurotic nationalism to turn them into misers who hoard more vaccines than they could possibly need. The second obscenity lies in the fate of their hidden treasure. Airfinity, a science analytics company, estimates that by the end of 2021, G7 countries may throw away 241m vaccines that have passed their expiry date. Brown describes their destruction as “unconscionable” and says he will send the projections to Biden, Johnson and EU leaders.
It is a cliche of western responses to see the poor world as filled with corrupt and failed states. Imagine what African and Asian news teams could now say about us. Camera crews might film vaccines being crushed into landfill sites, as the reporters intoned that, though it was harsh to admit it, the truth was that childish and irresponsible westerners were so prone to wastefulness they could not be trusted to govern themselves. Rational self-interest is the best form of selfishness and it is clearly absent today. More common is an embittered parochialism, which begins by not wanting to think about the rest of humanity and ends by hating them. God knows but I had my disagreements with Brown when he was in government. But there is no greater sign of the triumph of stupid nationalism than the replacement of Brown and politicians who could rise to a crisis with the babbling, play-acting, post-Brexit caricatures. They took power by saying that foreigners were trying to swindle honest Brits and cannot now show generosity to the rest of the world. The knowledge that we will not be safe until everyone is safe has aroused a determination among the worst of nationalists not to be driven by science or bow before multinational institutions. The know-nothing spirit that animated the Trump and Brexit movements has survived into the pandemic. The Trump administration withdrew from the World Health Organization. The Johnson government cut the foreign aid budget in the middle of an emergency when poor countries needed help most and the UK needed the epidemiological protection and economic stimulus that a global effort to contain Covid would bring. It did so safe in the knowledge that the majority of the public would not care. Since the start of the pandemic, news bulletins have repeated the number of Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths. When the regulators approved vaccines, the numbers of those who had received one and then two jabs were added. But at no point do we hear how many vaccines are going to countries that cannot afford to buy them. Until that changes, there will be no hope of tackling Covid, let alone the catastrophic climate crisis that is rushing towards us like an unstoppable storm. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",0
97792,The Australian welfare system has always been needlessly cruel. Now it’s punishing half the country | Tom Hawking,2020-03-25 01:43:36+00:00,Opinion,"Like a lot of people, I called Centrelink on Monday. After 11 attempts to get through, I was greeted with a message directing me to the MyGov website. Navigating that site eventually revealed that to register, I’d need a customer reference number, which could only be obtained … by phone. Welcome to the 12 Tasks of Centrelink. Judging by the lengthy message imploring callers not to abuse staff to which you’re forced to listen before you’re admitted into the oubliette that is Centrelink’s phone queue at the moment, there are a lot of people out there who are angry and bewildered at the current situation. This, of course, is hardly surprising: the unprecedented economic effects of coronavirus mean there are a lot of people turning to the government to help for the first time, and they’re clearly not impressed by the system they’re being required to navigate. Anyone more used to dealing with that system, however, will find the maddeningly circular experience of trying to get any sense out of Centrelink all too familiar … which, of course, is the whole point.
Over the last 30 years or so, successive governments have done their best to one-up each other in making benefits ever more difficult to access. Every passing year seems to bring a new requirement: the diaries that need to be filled out to “prove” you’re looking for work, with their implication that those claiming benefits are liars; the demerit point system, whereby applicants are punished unilaterally and without right of appeal – and, in many cases, unfairly – at the discretion of a private service provider; the “mutual obligation” system with its ever-moving goalposts, questionable courses and pointless make-work. How did we come to this? Like many other systems, the Australian welfare system has its roots in the post-war consensus and welfare state, and the understanding that the provision of state support is preferable to a situation where loss of employment can result in homelessness and destitution. And as in many other countries, as that consensus has crumbled under 40 years of free-market rhetoric and neoliberal economic policy, the support system has slowly devolved from a well-intentioned safety net into an ever-constricting noose.
Under the particular combination of social and economic conservatism that took hold in Australia during the John Howard years (and in many other western democracies over the period that basically began with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan), a need for state assistance is treated less as an economic crisis than it is as a moral failure on the claimant’s part. For decades now, the unemployed have been among the favourite political punching bags of politicians and ideologues alike, perhaps because the very existence of both these groups seems to undermine the promise of free-market rhetoric: those who advocate for unrestrained capitalism do so on the basis that the market will inevitably elevate and enrich those who work hard enough. Those who remain poor and/or unemployed, therefore, must, by definition, not be trying hard enough. Thus is born the mythology of the dole bludger: the idler who refuses to work, and in doing so, “steals” the tax dollars of those who do work hard and thus pay to subsidise his/her laziness. The simple act of asking for help is rendered in criminal terms (and, not coincidentally, in a manner strikingly similar to how asking for refuge is portrayed). With this in mind, it’s perhaps no surprise that work-for-the-dole programs quite literally treat the unemployed in the same way as criminals. And in the same way that harsher prison sentences do little to reduce crime, the irony of punitive welfare programs is that, far from “encouraging” people back into work, they instead have the effect of locking people into the welfare system. The government has hastened to make it clear that those seeking Covid-19-related help will be spared some of the worst depredations of the system. But what makes those who lost their jobs during a pandemic any more trustworthy than those who lost their job for any other reason? Why are the former spared the indignity of being treated as scrounging chancers? As with many of the other “necessary” social indignities that have been magically “set aside” for Covid-19, the fact these measures can be so easily discarded only goes to show how unnecessary they were in the first place. If anything positive comes of the Covid-19 crisis, it’ll be to remind Australians that any of us can fall through the cracks and end up as the person who needs help. Perhaps those who have never dealt with Centrelink before will have more empathy for those who have to deal with it on a regular basis, and come to understand that unemployment is not a choice or a way of life, it’s a state that can befall any of us, and one that the vast majority of people want to escape as soon as possible.
In the meantime, faced with a PR disaster, the government is now presented with the challenge of wringing efficiency and helpfulness out of a system designed to provide neither. It’s hard not to take a degree of pleasure out of watching them flail about trying to do so, but it’s also maddening to compare the standards to which the unemployed are held, and the ineptitude with which governments get away: welfare recipients are punished for going to the doctor instead of attending an appointment, and yet Stuart Robert escapes with a casual “my bad” for his complete failure to prepare for the single greatest challenge in living memory to face his department. We’re told constantly the unemployed are a drain on society, that we “can’t afford” to increase welfare payments, that we’re “owed” huge sums by fraudulent claimants, and so on. This week has shown what we already knew: that this needlessly cruel system – with its artificial scarcity, its hoarding of resources by the privileged few, and its ceaseless demonisation of those left out – is not a natural state of being. It is imposed on us, and that imposition can be suspended in an emergency. The only question, then, is what constitutes an emergency: who matters, who is important and who needs to be at risk for the referee to step in and the ghastly game to be stopped. In 2016 film-maker Ken Loach described the UK’s benefits system as “a Kafka-esque, Catch-22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary”. His words could just as easily apply to the Australian system, which is also designed to be punitive and humiliating. Right now, it’s punishing and humiliating half the country. • Tom Hawking is a freelance writer based in Melbourne",0
118643,Is England's Covid roadmap the right way out of lockdown? The experts' view,2021-02-22 16:26:29+00:00,Opinion,"Devi Sridhar: We should be treating Covid-19 like measles, not flu
Boris Johnson appears to have finally learned a lesson about the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering. The government’s roadmap for easing the lockdown allows for flexibility and is guided by the data rather than the dates. But there are still difficult problems to overcome. Until 80% to 90% of the population has been vaccinated, a large percentage of people will still be susceptible to infection and hospitalisation, giving the virus plenty of opportunities to spread and strain the NHS. If England is to break the cycle of continuous lockdowns, it should learn a lesson from Israel: vaccines can be an effective way to suppress the virus, but only when they are also rolled out to younger age groups. Prominent voices – including that of the health secretary – have told us that Covid-19 will become a seasonal infection, much like flu. But our public health approach should be more akin to measles. The UK should be aiming to suppress and eliminate Covid-19 through vaccines, mass testing and supported isolation. After we’ve achieved this, the UK should then help poorer countries in their vaccination efforts. Unlike the early days of the pandemic, you will now find very few people advocating for the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 (the so-called “herd immunity” approach). The real shame is that such voices ever had any influence over the government’s pandemic response. Over the past 12 months, Britain has lost almost 130,000 lives to Covid-19. Had the government pursued a zero-Covid approach from the start, following the example of countries like Australia, far fewer people would have died. In the end, England seems to be on its way out of this pandemic, saved by vaccines and seasonal change. Outdoor transmission is a minimal risk, so it makes sense for the government to lift restrictions on outdoor socialising first. In fact, Scotland has allowed under-12s to play in small groups outdoors since July. This would be an easy win for England and other countries, too. The imminent risk now is the full return of schools on 8 March leading to uncontrolled transmission. Scotland has taken a different approach, allowing younger primary students to go back on 22 February, followed by other students over the coming weeks in a phased process, as the impact on transmission is monitored and analysed. Again, England’s roadmap must be driven by data and science, and not by the loudest voices in the room. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Jennifer Dowd: The approach to Covid-19 in schools is one of dangerous exceptionalism
Many parents in England will have heaved a sigh of relief that schools are due to reopen on 8 March. But aside from testing pupils on a twice-weekly basis, ministers have offered no further detail on how transmission in schools will be prevented as part of the government’s roadmap for easing lockdown. As with many aspects of our pandemic response, England’s approach to Covid-19 in schools seems one of dangerous exceptionalism. While there have been many spirited debates about the precise role that schools play in helping Covid-19 spread, two things are indisputable. First, schools bring people into prolonged physical contact with one another, talking and breathing indoors. Second, Covid-19 is spread primarily through aerosols that spread better in unventilated environments. Pretending that the rules of physics and biology somehow don’t apply in classrooms risks undoing the difficult sacrifices of lockdown. To ensure the reopening of schools doesn’t bring the R number back above 1, England must put basic mitigation measures in place. Masks should be mandated in classrooms, and schools should be better ventilated. Opening doors and windows can have a significant impact on reducing the accumulation of aerosols. Where that’s not possible, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can make a big difference at a relatively low cost. Kids of all ages around the world are wearing masks in school this year. The same should be the case in England. Arguing that masks inhibit classroom learning when the alternative is sending students home to self-isolate, or closing schools altogether, defies common sense. Alone, each of these measures is imperfect. But taken together, they can have a significant effect on the rate of transmission. Mask-wearing in schools need not be perfect, and individual exceptions can be made. Unfortunately, we will never know how many Covid-19 cases and deaths in England could have been avoided if these basic school mitigation measures had been put in place last September. To ensure this lockdown really is the last one, we should not make the same mistake twice. Jennifer Dowd is a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford Graham Medley: The government’s gradual timeline seems sensible
During an epidemic there are only two directions a virus can take: up or down. If the R number is above 1, the virus is going to spread, and if it is below 1, the virus will decrease. At the moment, the UK’s epidemic is decreasing but we know it could double in size in a couple of weeks if transmission picks up again. Despite the progress made in driving down cases during the lockdown, we’re only a month away from being back in the same position as we were in December. This is why a careful, measured approach to easing restrictions is sensible. The government’s roadmap proposes a gradual timeline for easing restrictions that will occur in four separate phases, with the final constraints lifted by no earlier than 21 June. Of course, things are not the same as they were in 2020. We now have a vaccine, which we are deploying at a remarkable rate. There are two things that control the rate of transmission of a virus – the amount of contact between people, and the proportion of those people who are susceptible to infection. When these two things are at their highest levels, the R number for this virus is about 3. A year ago we were all susceptible to the virus, as there were no vaccines available and nobody had been exposed to Covid-19 before, so reducing contact was the only way to make R smaller. Now, with more than one-third of the population estimated to be immune to the virus, the maximum R can get to is 2, and fewer restrictions will be needed to keep R below 1. But timing is everything. If the amount of social contact increases faster than susceptibility decreases, then transmission could dramatically increase. If susceptibility goes down faster, and lockdown measures are prolonged, then we will be unnecessarily restricting people’s lives and livelihoods. Balancing the amount of social contact with the speed of the vaccine rollout will allow us to exit the epidemic with minimal damage from now on. This will not be the end of Covid-19, and there will be more twists in the tale. But the next few months will be a key step in learning how to live with it. Graham Medley is a professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and chairs the Sage sub-group on pandemic modelling Stephen Reicher: A coherent and sustainable long-term strategy is still missing
After a year during which the government responded to rising infections too slowly and lifted restrictions too quickly, Boris Johnson has promised that, this time, the easing of lockdown will be “cautious but irreversible”. In some ways, the government’s new roadmap for lifting England’s third lockdown looks very different to previous attempts. There will be no sudden reopening of the economy, and people will only be allowed to mix indoors in the third phase of the roadmap, which will be introduced no earlier than 17 May. But in other respects, this roadmap throws caution to the wind. Opening schools in one go hardly seems like a prudent decision. On this issue, the government could have learned from countries such as Norway, which has adopted a “traffic light” system: in areas with higher levels of infection, children return to school for some of the time to allow for social distancing, and multiple safeguards are still in place. As infections fall, these restrictions are lifted. The answer to whether this roadmap will ensure an “irreversible” lifting of restrictions is again found in the detail. The best way to irreversibly lift restrictions is to enforce other measures that can drive down infections when the lockdown is lifted. Vaccinations are clearly one of those measures, but for now at least, they are insufficient on their own. England still urgently needs an improved test-and-trace system in order to identify new cases and variants. The government needs to provide adequate resources to people who are self-isolating, rather than simply instructing them to do so. England must find ways to make schools, workplaces and restaurants safer, with a common set of standards for what makes a place Covid-safe. And we need to properly control our borders, with robust isolation policies in place for people arriving from countries where variants are unknown. In short, we need a coherent and sustainable long-term strategy to suppress Covid-19. That has always been missing. It still is.

103814,The pandemic is not over – we need to push now for a zero-coronavirus Britain | Devi Sridhar,2020-06-22 16:33:15+00:00,Opinion,"As we see the return of the sunshine this week, and as the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the UK continues to fall, it can feel as if the worst of the pandemic is over. Far from relaxing, the government should be using this respite to make long-term plans on how to coexist with the virus until a vaccine can be found. Time is running out – when the cold and damp weather sets in, the virus will thrive. Test, trace and isolate schemes will be stretched as soon as flu symptoms rise and overlap with Covid-19 symptoms. Avoiding a second lockdown must be the imperative to ensure that the sacrifices made by the British public over the past 13 weeks do not go to waste. Currently the government’s drive to open up as quickly as possible bears a risk of another increase in infections, similar to what is being experienced in several US states such as Florida, Arizona and Texas, and in Iran. Ian Diamond, the UK’s national statistician, warned that the UK currently faces 3,000-4,000 new infections per day and only a fraction of those are being picked up through the test and protect scheme. By allowing the virus to spread during the summer months the government is creating a ticking time bomb that will go off as autumn arrives. Covid-19 is too dangerous to let spread through a population unchecked. Not only because of the difficulty of staying within health service capacity and overall mortality, but also because of the morbidity it entails. The FT has estimated that 65,000 excess deaths have occurred so far during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. In addition, an increasing number of long-term health complications are being seen in those who have recovered from the virus, and often in those who were healthy previously. Covid-19 is not the flu, but a multi-system disease that has surprised doctors in how it presents and how it develops within the human body. Important questions about immunity remain about whether re-infection is possible, or even immune enhancement where individuals get a more severe version of the same virus upon repeated exposure, such as with dengue fever. That is not to say countries should remain in lockdown until a vaccine is discovered, given the economic and social costs. Instead, each country will need to find the “least worst” path out of this situation based on their populations, public health system and capacity. An increasing number of countries are trying to suppress the virus to a low level and, where possible, eliminate it before reopening their schools, shops and restaurants. Not only New Zealand, but also Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and countries in east Asia. Once the virus has all but disappeared, governments in these nations are able to identity imported cases – such as the two women who travelled from the UK who reintroduced Covid-19 to New Zealand – and limit their spread. It is possible to both eliminate the virus and reopen economies – but it has to be done cautiously and with close monitoring. As an island, Great Britain is in a strong position to eliminate the virus and fully reopen schools, bars and theatres as well as bringing back sports matches and weddings, without pointless debates about 1 or 2 metre distancing measures. This would require mass testing – to catch all symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers – tracing of contacts and isolation for those individuals. The public needs to be convinced that the short-term pain is worth it, including continued physical distancing from others, use of face masks when distancing is not possible, and putting aside short-term self-interest for a few more months. Local dashboards should be created using the first part of postcodes, so individuals can understand transmission within their communities and ensure their behaviour contributes to a downwards push. Covid-19 will burn itself out if it has no other hosts to transmit it.
A clear push towards a “zero coronavirus” Britain should have been the priority when the country went into late lockdown on 23 March. And while other countries raced ahead with testing and tracing, and border control, and face masks, the UK government seemed to think that locking down alone was the solution, instead of a window of extremely costly time to aggressively go after the virus and drive it out. As a Chinese colleague told me in early March, implement key public health measures now and you’ll be out of the woods by mid-June. The UK government has missed chance after chance to suppress this virus and reopen the economy as quickly as possible. The summer months offer it a narrow timeframe to reassess its overall strategy in managing this outbreak. It feels like decisions are being made based on polling to see how this affects government approval ratings, rather than based on what is needed to get through this crisis. Planning and leadership are required to look at where the country needs to be, then work back from that to implement the key measures to get there. All of our lives, jobs and futures depend on it. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh • This article was amended on 23 June 2020.

105773,"The world needs a 'people's vaccine' for coronavirus, not a big-pharma monopoly | Helen Clark and Winnie Byanyima",2020-07-23 09:00:38+00:00,Opinion,"To bring an end to the pandemic, the world needs a vaccine. Promising early trial results for the vaccine developed by Oxford University suggest we’re inching closer to discovering one.
Data published recently in the Lancet shows the Oxford vaccine produced antibodies and T-cells in roughly 1,000 patients. The pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, has been licensed to produce this vaccine by early 2021, which includes an agreement to produce 1 billion doses with the Serum Institute in India for low- and middle-income countries by the end of that year. But this is still a long way from what is needed. To vaccinate everyone, the world needs as many as 7.8bn doses, as quickly as possible. If the successful vaccine requires more than one dose, or must be given annually, as seems likely, the figure will be higher still. The world will need a near-permanent supply of the vaccine. Only then can we bring Covid-19 under control. Once a safe and effective vaccine is discovered, the only barrier to providing sufficient doses should be the world’s manufacturing capacity. But other artificial barriers stand in the way. The intellectual property laws that grant pharmaceutical companies the exclusive rights to produce a particular medicine for a certain number of years are intended to reward investment and innovation into new medicines. These intellectual property rights are often abused and create monopolies, and in the case of the Covid-19 vaccine they threaten to limit the supply, causing deadly shortages and unnecessary delays. Granting one company exclusive rights to the science, knowhow and intellectual property of a coronavirus vaccine will prevent us from getting the billions of doses that the world needs. No private company, however committed it might be to delivering a vaccine, should have a monopoly over this public resource. A global pandemic is not the time to artificially ration the supply of a medicine because of failed ideas about the sanctity of intellectual property. Nor should the market be protected simply to serve the interests of pharmaceutical corporations. It’s also important to remember that AstraZeneca didn’t discover this vaccine. Billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money have been poured into the development and production of a Covid-19 vaccine. AstraZeneca has received $1.2bn from the United States government alone, and at least £84m from the UK government. Nor is the company bearing the risks of this innovation alone: governments are already committing to purchase the vaccine in advance of its production. In the rush to solve the global challenge of finding a Covid-19 vaccine, the leaders of rich countries appear to be relying on the goodwill of companies and a charitable approach towards poor nations and ignoring the barriers that intellectual property and other monopolies present. They seem to be assuming that the only option available is a private, market-based approach directed and controlled by pharmaceutical corporations. As the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, and prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, made clear recently when they joined 140 other public figures in calling for a “people’s vaccine”, this would be a grave mistake. Current distribution plans for the Oxford vaccine are an alarming reminder of what happens when you leave a public resource in the hands of a single company. Around 300m doses have been promised for developing countries by the end of this year – a welcome step, but one that pales in comparison with the 400m doses that will go to the US and UK. The Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany have secured another 400m doses between them. The EU and other rich nations are also pushing their way to the front of the queue. Many middle-income countries, such as those in Latin America, where the scale of the outbreak is frightening, may be completely locked out of these arrangements. When the American virologist Jonas Salk was asked who owned the patent to the polio vaccine he invented, he famously replied: “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” Oxford University should heed his remark and show leadership by contributing its knowledge and intellectual property to the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, where technology and treatments are shared for the benefit of all. Likewise, governments and charitable foundations that are funding promising vaccine candidates should insist the intellectual property and knowhow of the products they fund is shared in the WHO pool. The WHO’s attempt to organise a global system where treatments are allocated equitably is also vital. Its efforts should be supported by a framework that places equitable allocation at the heart of all decision-making – including the moment when companies first sign funding agreements with governments and health agencies. But if the WHO is to be successful in the face of vaccine nationalism, we must also do absolutely everything we can to maximise supply. Aside from insisting on the sharing of knowledge and intellectual property, rich countries should be urgently financing the rapid expansion of safe manufacturing capacity in developing countries. This extraordinary moment calls for a better approach than our current regime of monopoly rights. Only then will we be able to discover and produce, as quickly as possible, a people’s vaccine. • Helen Clark is a former prime minister of New Zealand and member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy • Winnie Byanyima is executive director of UNAids and UN undersecretary general",0
101832,How the 'Plandemic' conspiracy theory took hold,2020-05-23 15:00:01+00:00,Opinion,"To have one viral sensation, Oscar Wilde might have said, is unfortunate. But to have two smacks of carelessness. And that’s what we have. The first is Covid-19, about which much printer’s ink has already been spilled. The second is Plandemic, a 26-minute “documentary” video featuring Dr Judy Mikovits, a former research scientist and inveterate conspiracy theorist who blames the coronavirus outbreak on big pharma, Bill Gates and the World Health Organization. She also claims that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which is headed by Dr Anthony Fauci) buried her research showing vaccines weaken people’s immune systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Just to round off the accusations, Mikovits claims that wearing masks is dangerous because it “literally activates your own virus”. And, if proof were needed that the pharma-Gates-scientific-elite cabal were out to get her, the leading journal Science in 2011 retracted a paper by her on a supposed link between a retrovirus and chronic fatigue syndrome that it had accepted in 2009. The video went online on 4 May when its maker, Mikki Willis, a hitherto little-known film producer, posted it to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and a separate website set up to share the video. For three days it built up a head of steam on Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories, many of which linked to the video on YouTube. By 11 May it had been viewed more than 8m times on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and had generated countless other posts on websites and social media. Later that day YouTube, Vimeo and Facebook took down the video, and in theory it disappeared from the internet – only of course it hadn’t, in the time-honoured way of subversive material in the networked world. The cognitive pathogen had escaped into the wild and was spreading virally.
As it did so, a number of journalists and network scientists began to map the route by which this niche obsession made it into the big time. A New York Times team traced it back to a Facebook page dedicated to QAnon, a rightwing conspiracy theory, which has 25,000 members, headed with the clickbait injunction “Exclusive Content, Must Watch”. The video went from being viewed directly on YouTube to people linking out to it on Facebook, Twitter and other social media channels, with each link increasing the possibility that it would make the next big jump. On the afternoon of 5 May, the link was shared by a celebrity medic who had appeared on Oprah and had half a million followers on Facebook. Later that evening Plandemic popped up on a large-scale political page on Facebook. The page, reports the NYT, “was for Reopen Alabama, which has over 36,000 members and was part of the movement by Americans who wanted to lift shelter-in-place orders. Once the video appeared on that page, which was linked to dozens of other Reopen America groups, it quickly began spreading to the pages of those other groups in a kind of forceful multiplier effect.” The next day it was shared by a Republican politician in Ohio with her 20,000 Facebook followers. “If you watch ANYTHING on my page,” she wrote, “it needs to be this.” This then brought the video into the Republican mainstream, which meant that it was everywhere in semi-polite rightwing society. The NYT reconstruction of Plandemic’s meteoric rise was complemented by the different approach taken by Erin Gallagher, a social media analyst who used analytical and graphical tools often used by data scientists. She looked for public Facebook posts containing the keywords “Plandemic” or “Judy Mikovits” and then started to draw the network graphs that emerged from those data sets. The most interesting thing about the resulting social media networks is the centrality of certain conspiracist Facebook pages and groups and YouTube channels in them. For example, QAnon looms large and central. So do Collective Action Against Bill Gates, ChemtrailsGlobalSkywatch, Fall of the Cabal, Truth Revolution, and even our old friend David Icke and his YouTube channel. This confirms something we’ve known since at least 2016, namely that conspiracy theory sites are the most powerful engines of disinformation around. And when they have a medical conspiracy theory to work with, then they are really in business. “Medical and health conspiracy theories do well,” said Prof Eric Oliver, a scholar who studies them, “because oftentimes they’re not explicitly ideological in the way that other conspiracy theories are. They tend to cross ideological domains.” In public opinion surveys in the US, he found that 40% of those polled agree with the proposition that “the Food and Drug Administration has been deliberately withholding natural cures for cancer because of secret pressure from the pharmaceutical industry.” And support for it comes from across the American political spectrum. All of which suggests that when a Covid-19 vaccine does eventually arrive, conspiracy theorists will have a field day. Assuming they haven’t all died of the virus first.

99010,It's good that Boris Johnson is back to work. But he is waffling  | Simon Jenkins,2020-04-27 12:31:20+00:00,Opinion,"Boris Johnson’s swift return to duty is welcome. He has clearly been through a personal nightmare. Given the pressures on him, he deserves sympathy and congratulations. In his address to the nation this morning he was characteristically Churchillian. He says Britain has come through coronavirus so far with flying colours. “Now we must prepare to win phase two as we have won phase one.” It is hard to know what news the prime minister has been watching or listening to. Johnson’s language was opaque to the point of waffle. The British people are in the dark, more so than any in Europe. Though statistics are still desperately unreliable, all we do know is that Britain has not performed well during the coronavirus pandemic. It is now among the most dilatory nations in securing recovery. The only strategy mentioned by Johnson was the need to “eliminate the risk of a second spike”. There is no way such a risk can be eliminated, short of never taking it. But it is unacceptable to hamstring the entire economy indefinitely, as Johnson implied, merely to stop further infection “overwhelming our NHS”. The unpreparedness of the NHS has contributed to Britain’s plight. Its future “protection” is not a sufficient reason for the scale of cost now being imposed on the economy. If there is another spike, the NHS must be helped to face it. The rest of Europe – an entity Johnson despises – is already well advanced into what he presumably means when he says phase two. Yet his speech was empty of specifics. There was no indication of ending the bias against the private care sector, the neglected “poor bloody infantry” of coronavirus. While the cabinet built now largely empty Nightingale hospitals and stalled operations, the elderly and those caring for them were left at serious risk, a glaring failure of a “nationalised” health service. If you want to nationalise welfare, nationalise it all. Meanwhile the illogicalities of lockdown grow more absurd by the day: the banning of bench-sitting in parks, the closure of rural resorts and beaches, permitting supermarkets to open but not garden centres or small traders. Covid-19 is clearly lethal chiefly to specific sections of the community, yet the current one-size-fits-all shutdown ignores this. And if Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can have exit strategies, why not Cornwall or Yorkshire – or England? The government’s lack of trust in English localism is pathological. A number of hesitant conclusions can already be drawn from the statistics. The virus is highly infectious and sensible distancing seems to mitigate its spread. But national excess deaths above the seasonal average seem largely to relate to demographics, such as age balance, population dispersal and urbanisation. Except in a few atypical cases, widely differing suppression policies have not been reflected in mortality rates.
This virus appears to have peaked in the first week of April, arguably before the full impact of the cabinet’s lockdown can have been felt. Now Johnson – who previously supported mitigation, not suppression – demands that we honour “past efforts and sacrifices”. This is meaningless if he continues with a questionable policy, against the certainty of the toll he is taking on British lives and livelihoods for years to come. Britons must listen in agony as leaders in Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Brussels and Rome articulate their routes out of this mess. Johnson and his colleagues have articulated nothing. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",0
94574,Donald Trump’s war on coronavirus is just his latest war on truth | Jonathan Freedland,2020-02-28 18:16:47+00:00,Opinion,"The coronavirus crisis is a war against a disease, but it’s also the most serious battle yet in the war on truth. That much was clear from the start, as China moved to hush up the first outbreak and gag the doctor who had spotted it. It was a classic case of what we might call Chernobyl syndrome: the tendency of authoritarian systems to react to disaster by rushing to downplay or cover up the problem, focusing more on shifting blame than tackling the threat head on. Viewers of last year’s TV dramatisation of the Chernobyl nuclear accident could recognise the pattern immediately, as the priority of those in charge becomes avoiding embarrassment rather than saving lives.
There was some of that in the Iranian reaction to the virus, as the country’s deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference called to reassure citizens, only later for it to be confirmed that he had himself been infected. (There were already suspicions, since Tehran’s official numbers didn’t add up.) And there was a grim logic to the fact that at the heart of the outbreak in South Korea is a religious sect similarly devoid of transparency. Usually, the democratic world can contrast itself flatteringly with such closed, controlled societies, proud that its approach to calamity is openness and the free flow of information. Indeed, crises like this one can serve as test cases for the competing merits of free systems v authoritarian ones. True, democracies cannot match Beijing’s ability to lock down whole cities and build an entire hospital in a week. But when it comes to a global pandemic, it’s free speech, full disclosure and cross-border scientific cooperation that ultimately save lives.
Except this time, the familiar authoritarian v democratic contrast has become muddled. That’s because the current leader of the world’s most powerful democracy, the US, has the same instincts as the authoritarian rulers he so admires, and those instincts have coloured his response to coronavirus. The result is that what for many must have seemed an abstract concern – Donald Trump’s assault on facts, experts and science – is now a matter of life and death. So while US medical officials have been at pains to brace Americans for the inevitability of coronavirus – a matter of when, not if – Trump and his outriders have worked hard to minimise the threat. On Thursday, Trump repeatedly referred to the figure of “15” cases in the US, when the actual figure was 60, and promised that that number would go down rather than up: “It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” Trump’s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, breezily assured the US public that the bug had been contained and that the country was sealed “pretty close to airtight” against the disease, when of course it is not. One of the administration’s most influential propagandists – for whom Trump paused his state of the union address this month so that his wife, Melania, might garland him with America’s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has been telling his vast audience that “the coronavirus is the common cold, folks”, and that it had been “overhyped” and “weaponised … to bring down Donald Trump”.
Trump has nodded in a similarly conspiracist direction, tweeting that the media are doing all they can “to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible”. That reference to the markets is key. Trump believes his chances of re-election in November hinge on his stewardship of the economy, betting that voters will back him if their pensions – linked to the stock market – are up. That the Dow Jones suffered the biggest one-day drop in its history on Thursday has him rattled. And so his first instinct is that of the Manhattan hustler-hotelier loudly assuring guests that the strong smell of burning coming from the ground floor is merely the chef trying out a new barbecue rather than a sign that the building is on fire. Crucial to that effort is talking loudly over the fire marshals, or even gagging them altogether. You could see that when Trump spoke in the White House briefing room, brazenly contradicting the experts by his side. But it’s now become formal policy, with Trump’s insistence that all federal officials – including those with deep scientific expertise – are to say nothing that has not first been authorised by the White House. Note the fate of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. On Thursday he dared say that “we are dealing with a serious virus” with a higher mortality rate than regular flu. That was deemed insufficiently upbeat for the great leader. According to the New York Times, “Dr Fauci has told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.” The new mantra, it seems, is to be one of Trump’s favourite phrases: repeated again on Thursday: “Nobody really knows.” That could be the motto of post-truthists such as Trump, conveying the hope that voters will become confused, concluding that no truth is ever even possible, and that in the fog of information and rumour it’s best simply to trust the man in charge. That’s what Trump wants every American to believe, about coronavirus and everything else for that matter: nobody really knows.
Now Trump has put his slavishly deferential vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the coronavirus effort. Put aside Pence’s appalling record as governor of Indiana, when his response to an HIV outbreak was to veto a medically recommended needle exchange programme and to offer his prayers instead. Focus instead on the fact that Pence has been appointed over the head of the health secretary, Alex Azar, whom Trump deemed too “alarmist”. In that same spirit, Trump has gutted the very agencies that the US will now desperately rely on. In 2018, he slashed health spending by $15bn, binning the Obama-era programmes and teams established for the express purpose of leading the US response to a pandemic. Among those cut: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – now in the frontline against coronavirus – which was forced to reduce by 80% its efforts to prevent global disease outbreak. The consequences are clear enough: only eight of the US’s 100 public-health labs are now even able to test for Covid-19.
This onslaught against the health agencies is of a piece with Trump’s entire approach to data, science and truth. You might remember “Sharpiegate”, when the president all but got out a black marker pen and amended a map issued by the key US meteorological agency so that it appeared to support his tweeted, and false, claim that Alabama was about to get hit by a hurricane. Trump has installed cronies and business pals at the helm of a raft of agencies previously respected as providers of neutral, factual data, the better to ensure those bodies say only what he wants them to say. He has moved to shrink their budgets – whether at the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps or the Census Bureau – and allowed experts with deep knowledge to retire and not be replaced. We can’t say we weren’t warned. On Trump’s first full day in office, he telephoned the head of the National Park Service, angered by photographs showing that crowds that had gathered for his inauguration the previous day were smaller than those for Barack Obama. The head of the NPS duly passed on the instruction from the president, and new, more flattering images appeared. We laughed about it at the time because it was so petty, so vain and so trivial. But the mindset was clear. The US president is a man who does not want the facts or the truth. He wants only what makes him look good. That impulse might not have mattered much in January 2017. But it matters gravely now. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",0
98483,The Guardian view on 'herd immunity': yes it was 'part of the plan' | Editorial,2020-04-29 18:36:52+00:00,Opinion,"In his seminal work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn developed the notion of the “paradigm” as a way of understanding how a community of researchers makes its judgments. A shared paradigm, observed Kuhn, is a mode of seeing a problem that makes certain presumptions and privileges particular perspectives. It sees things. But it also misses things. As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, the British government relied on the wrong paradigm. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has insisted that herd immunity – the idea that allowing a virus to spread will eventually build up sufficient resistance in a population – was never a “part of the plan” in the battle against Covid-19. But today’s Guardian’s investigation into the government’s early handling of the crisis leaves little room for doubt: the concept was fundamental to the government’s decision-making in the crucial months of February and March, as most of the rest of the world took a different path. It was abandoned only when it became clear that the NHS would be utterly overwhelmed and hundreds of thousands of Britons could conceivably die. There were other reasons why Britain remained a relatively relaxed outlier in early March, as Italy, France and Spain moved towards lockdowns and Germany followed South Korea in pursuing a rigorous test, trace and contact strategy. The distraction of Brexit played a part. A reluctance on the part of Boris Johnson to overly impinge on the rights of “free-born Englishmen” also influenced government strategy. It may have been assumed that because outbreaks of deadly diseases such as Sars-CoV had been confined to Asia, the new coronavirus would follow a similar pattern. Our investigation also suggests that ministers could have exaggerated the likely resistance from the public to more stringent measures. Above all, though, the framework was wrong. The laissez-faire blueprint for the government’s response to the crisis was overwhelmingly derived from previous experience of pandemic influenza. In the absence of a vaccine, flu spreads fast, becomes milder as it mutates, and populations can eventually acquire resistance once a majority of people have become infected. Herd immunity, distasteful as it sounds, can work. But as we now know, Covid-19 is horribly, devastatingly different. In the words of David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s envoy to Britain: “Coronaviruses are horrible. You can’t just let this thing … wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess and it will endanger health workers.” Britain finally entered into lockdown on 23 March. By then, the despair of overwhelmed Italian doctors had been broadcast around the world. That footage, and a now famous Imperial College advice paper, which predicted up to 250,000 deaths if the government’s strategy was continued, smashed the herd immunity framework. The same figure had appeared in a 2 March paper. Only now did it concentrate ministerial minds. Well over 26,000 Britons have died from Covid-19 and there are fears that Britain will emerge from the crisis with the worst fatality rate in Europe. The ministerial mantra has been that “the right decisions were taken at the right time”. But lives would have been saved if rigorous social distancing had been imposed earlier and the transmission of the virus reduced. This is a truth that should be acknowledged by the prime minister and his government. But it should also inform policymaking now that the debate has turned to easing the lockdown amid fears of economic collapse. There is still no vaccine – and nothing approaching a herd immunity strategy can be contemplated again. Until a testing regime can be established that matches the efficiency of those in Germany and South Korea, stringent restrictions must remain. No more unnecessary risks should be taken with people’s lives.",0
