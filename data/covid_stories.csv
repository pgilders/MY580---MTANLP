It has also shown us how quickly fear, misinformation and blame can spread, only hindering the fight against the pneumonia-causing virus. The alarm is understandable. More than 6,000 cases have been confirmed, and more than 130 people have died: a public health expert at Imperial College has suggested that 100,000 may be infected already. World Health Organization officials think it is impossible to predict when the outbreak will peak. Though only a few score people outside China have been confirmed as infected, they are scattered from the US and Australia to Thailand and the UAE. In Japan and Germany, patients who have never been to China have been taken ill. The response has been dramatic. China has placed around 50 million people under lockdown in Hubei province. Villages and even housing compounds have imposed their own quarantines, and many people are simply staying at home. Neighbouring Mongolia has closed off its border with China completely and banned all public gatherings. British Airways and other airlines have halted all flights to and from mainland China. These drastic measures may have an economic impact even beyond China’s borders. Already the new year holiday has been extended, affecting factories across the country whose customers may well rely on just-in-time manufacturing. Wuhan itself is an industrial hub. At present, key questions remain unanswered. We do not know how the new coronavirus first emerged, how easily it spreads, or its fatality rate. Mild cases and shortages of diagnostic kits means that the tally of cases and deaths may be inaccurate. Until we have better answers, it is hard to judge how much of a threat this poses compared to, say, existing flu strains. Some gaps in our knowledge are inevitable when a new disease emerges. Others are likely to reflect China’s handling of the crisis, in spite of the WHO’s praise for Beijing and the dedication of scientists and medical staff. Its response has been a vast improvement on 2003, when the Sars outbreak was covered up for months. But there is little doubt the Wuhan authorities, at least, badly mishandled matters – encouraging tourism and holding a banquet for 40,000 people days after confirmation of the new coronavirus. Strikingly, the mayor of Wuhan has said he could not disclose information on the virus until authorised to do so by more senior officials. Lack of knowledge facilitated its spread. The outbreak has also exposed the limits of a health system struggling to cope under normal circumstances, and the weaknesses of a party-state which justifies its existence not through an electoral mandate, but its ability to answer basic needs. Two hospitals in Wuhan are being built from scratch, within days. Yet hospitals have had to issue appeals for masks and protective gowns. Complacency, incompetence and cover-ups are hardly unknown in democracies. But an authoritarian political culture which punishes rather than rewards transparency prevents accountability and struggles to change course. It also, perversely, encourages rumours internally and externally. Conspiracy theories are spreading, along with discrimination towards people from Wuhan within China, and Chinese people abroad, the latter reflecting old racist tropes about disease and hygiene. Such prejudices do nothing to protect health. Justified scrutiny of the official response is necessary. It must not be conflated with hostility towards people who need and deserve help and sympathy.",2020-01-29 19:03:25+00:00,92980,2
93496,commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians,Opinion,The coronavirus panic is turning the UK into a hostile environment for east Asians | Sam Phan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians,"The atmosphere on my morning commute is tense. As panic over the coronavirus deepens and dominates the headlines, as an east Asian I can’t help but feel more and more uncomfortable. On the bus to work last week, as I sat down, the man next to me immediately scrambled to gather his stuff and stood up to avoid sitting next to me.
On the train over the weekend, a group sat opposite me chattering about their weekend plans. One of them seriously advised the rest, “I wouldn’t go to Chinatown if I were you, they have that disease.” As I made my way towards Chinatown in London, an elderly woman and her friend on the escalators at Leicester Square underground station were casually talking about how dangerous the area now was, and she complained she was obliged to go there for a meeting. “At least I’m old, I have nothing left to lose,” she laughed. In another loud conversation, I overheard a woman talking about how terrified she was that her friend, who had spent some time working with Chinese students, might have infected her with the virus. In light of current events, we east Asians in the UK are on high alert, paying close attention to how people interact with us. It is not their concern about health that is problematic, but the stereotyping of all east Asians as a coronavirus risk. At times such as this, even a simple bus trip can feel like a hostile environment. A friend at a university library experienced something similar: as soon as they sat down at a desk, the person in front of them packed up their things to leave. We’re noticing odd things like this that we never saw happen before. Perhaps it did not occur to some of these people, so happy to talk loudly in front of me, that I was also concerned about the virus – or that I, as a British citizen, was no more likely than them to be carrying the virus. They grouped all east Asian people together, without factoring in that perhaps we were British or, if not, we were from unaffected areas of China, or even came from other countries in the Chinese diaspora. We were all the same to them. The virus that originated in Wuhan has spread to at least eight other countries including Thailand, Japan, Australia and the US, and it’s “highly likely” it will reach the UK, according to Public Health England.
As it spreads, the virus has revealed more and more stereotyped judgments about Chinese people. I have also heard accounts from east Asians, even if they are not Chinese, who have recently been profiled while travelling at airports or on trains due to the ignorant perception that all east Asians are Chinese. George Osborne, editor of the Evening Standard, proudly tweeted his newspaper’s cartoon of a rat with a face mask to supposedly commemorate the lunar new year. Piers Morgan mocked the Chinese language on Good Morning Britain with a tired “ching chang chong” joke. East Asians have been accused of instigating the virus by having “revolting” eating habits. Most Asians know these stereotypes all too well. These insulting depictions don’t reflect the reality of being Chinese at all, and encourage the misguided perception of more than one billion people being a monolithic and singular group in which everyone speaks, acts and looks the same. In fact, there is a huge diversity. Language and culture vary massively within the region. Speakers of Hokkien would not be able to converse with people who speak Hakka. And despite Mandarin being the lingua franca, there are more than 200 dialects spoken across China. In fact in Wuhan itself, a beautiful and diverse city with more than 3,500 years of history, many of its population of 11.8 million speak a Wuhan dialect. Elsewhere, natives of Aksu look completely different to the majority Han Chinese. And the food, too: dim sum from the south of China is vastly different from the tangy, spicy flavours of Sichuan.
This week, my ethnicity has made me feel like I was part of a threatening and diseased mass. To see me as someone who carries the virus just because of my race is, well, just racist. As the lunar new year celebrations take place across the world, let’s take a moment to think about the way in which east Asians are perceived and how important it is to see us in all our diversity, as individual human beings, and to challenge stereotypes. The coronavirus is a human tragedy, so let’s not allow fear to breed hatred, intolerance and racism. • Sam Phan is an MA student at the University of Manchester",2020-01-27 16:15:51+00:00,93497,2
93815,commentisfree/2020/jan/26/observer-view-on-coronavirus-outbreak,Opinion,The Observer view on the coronavirus outbreak | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/26/observer-view-on-coronavirus-outbreak,"The world’s most populous country yesterday celebrated the lunar new year, usually a time of family reunion and joyful celebration. For many Chinese people who have moved away from their place of birth, it is the one time of year they get to visit their familiesThis year the coronavirus outbreak has profoundly muted the celebrations in China, with several cities in lockdown, the imposition of quarantine measures unprecedented in their scale, and many citizens anxious about their own health and that of their families. The Chinese have borne the brunt of the outbreak so far: coronavirus is known to have killed more than 40 people, and infected another 1,300. But the first cases have already been recorded in the US, Australia, and – on Friday – in Europe. Like Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome, also a coronavirus), bird flu and Ebola, this coronavirus is a zoonotic virus, transferred from animals to humans. In this case, scientists think it is likely to have come from bats or snakes in a live food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It is not yet known how infectious it is, and there are fears that it could yet lead to a global pandemic. Although its symptoms currently appear to be less severe than Sars, it may mutate. China’s response stands in stark contrast to the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003, and has won it international plaudits. In 2002, China tried to cover up the spread of Sars: newspapers were forbidden from reporting it, public health officials told citizens there was nothing to worry about, and little was done to stop the deadly virus spreading across China. This time the authorities have been more open: they promptly informed the World Health Organization, shared the virus’s genetic sequence with the rest of the world and imposed strict travel restrictions and quarantine conditions affecting more than 50 million people. There are, however, concerns that the unprecedented scale of this quarantine – only possible because of the authoritarianism of the Chinese government – could risk counterproductive levels of anxiety and panic. Outside China, the global response has also been reassuring in the main. There is no cure for this particular virus, but work is under way to develop a vaccine. What this outbreak does reveal, however, is a global failure to take action to minimise the risk of zoonotic viruses jumping species from animals to humans. We are relatively fortunate that, so far, this virus is not as deadly as Sars or Ebola. But there is a very real risk of this happening again. Eating or transporting and trading wildlife is associated with a heightened risk of these viruses transferring to humans. In some areas, abject poverty pushes people to consume bush meat; Ebola is thought to have originated in wild bats that were killed for food, and in China and other parts of south-east Asia, eating wildlife is considered to be a symbol of wealth and social status, and beneficial to human health. The risk here lies in “wet markets” where live and dead animals are in close proximity. The markets continue to exist because of consumer preference: some older people in China, who grew up without refrigerators, are more comfortable buying meat from animals that are freshly slaughtered. But they provide ideal conditions for new and dangerous viruses to emerge. The Chinese authorities did try to clamp down in the immediate wake of the Sars outbreak, but many markets continue to flourish. From the spread of zoonotic viruses to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and the climate crisis, the most existential challenges we face are truly global. They make a mockery of outdated notions of national sovereignty; the idea that so long as we exert control within our tiny corner of the world, everything will be fine. Global challenges like these will test to destruction the ability of transnational institutions such as the WHO, the EU and the World Trade Organization to chivvy along global coordination. They serve as a grave warning to those who would bury their heads in isolationism.",2020-01-26 06:00:15+00:00,93816,2
94354,global/commentisfree/2020/jan/23/china-coronavirus-sars-cover-up-beijing-disease-dissent,Opinion,China’s response to the coronavirus shows what it learned from the Sars cover-up | Thomas Abraham,https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/jan/23/china-coronavirus-sars-cover-up-beijing-disease-dissent,"A new disease arrives in a Chinese winter – is history repeating itself? At the end of 2002, Sars erupted in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Nearly two decades on, another new virus has struck at roughly the same time of year, this time in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Though the diseases are similar – Sars and the new Wuhan virus are from the same coronavirus family, and both attack the lungs – there is a great deal of difference in the way China has responded to these outbreaks.
In 2002, China was in denial and concealed the existence of Sars not merely from the outside world but from its own people. Newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease, except for occasional statements from government officials assuring the public that there was nothing to worry about. Such was the obsession with suppressing “negative news” that when a sick traveller from Guangdong arrived in Beijing, doctors there had no idea of what the illness was, and allowed it to spread in the city. The people of Guangdong, however, knew there was something frightening going on. Nurses, doctors and healthcare workers were telling their friends and family they had never seen a disease that attacked so viciously and spread so rapidly. The provincial government’s aim in Guangdong was simple: to stop local people from panicking and ensure that foreign investors and businesses were not scared away. Guangdong had set itself a GDP growth target of 12.2%, and no disease was going to be allowed to stop the onward march of the economy. The cost of the Chinese cover-up was immense, both in human lives as well as global standing. Had China warned the world about this new disease and shared the considerable knowledge its doctors had already gained about its symptoms and its treatment, other countries would have been prepared and far fewer lives would have been lost. The fallout from China’s handling of Sars forced a move towards greater openness that has been apparent in other outbreaks of disease. In the case of the Wuhan flu, the World Health Organization as well as the public were informed on 31 December about the new disease. By early January, the virus had been identified as a coronavirus by Chinese scientists, and its genetic sequence had been shared globally. Both of these moves were essential for an effective global response to the disease. Importantly, countries were aware of the disease before the first travellers brought it to their shores. The greater openness in China has done little to lessen the primeval fear experienced by people confronted with a new and largely unknown disease. Virologists, clinicians and epidemiologists still know little about it, except that it is caused by a coronavirus, that the first cases appeared to be associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, and that the number of cases seems to be rising steadily. It is unclear how severe the disease is. What proportion of people who get infected fall severely ill or die? Is this a virus that primarily causes a mild illness in people, so that most people don’t even realise they have been infected, or is it a disease that hits hard, and sends most of those it infects to hospital? According to Chinese authorities, 17 people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all in Wuhan, and there have been 633 confirmed cases. The true numbers of those who have contracted the disease are likely to be much larger. There may be many more who have not gone to hospital because their symptoms are mild. We do not even know whether this disease kills more people than other common diseases such as influenza. China seems determined to see that it does not suffer the loss of image that happened after Sars, and the unprecedented lockdown of 20 million people in Wuhan and two neighbouring cities indicates that it is determined to quash this disease as firmly as it quashes political dissent. Given the huge scientific uncertainties that exist, this may well be overkill. This is an animal virus, and according to WHO experts there is no evidence yet that it transmits easily and in a sustained way between human beings. There is also no guarantee that a lockdown will work to contain the virus. If it is indeed spreading fast and widely, then more and more cases are going to pop up all over the country regardless. The Sars epidemic mysteriously disappeared in the summer of 2003, nine months after it arrived. Unlike other diseases, it has never returned to the places that it once terrorised. No one knows why this is so. If China gets incredibly lucky, this new virus too could disappear. On the other hand, if the number of cases and deaths increase, China’s rulers could face something they fear more than disease itself: anger at a botched response and social discontent. • Thomas Abraham is the author of Twenty-First Century Plague: The Story of Sars",2020-01-23 15:30:38+00:00,94355,2
94572,commentisfree/2020/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak-leadership-is-required,Opinion,The Guardian view on the coronavirus outbreak: leadership is required | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak-leadership-is-required,"A passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan became the first Briton to die of the Covid-19 coronavirus on Friday. Further UK cases beyond the 20 already confirmed are expected, while countries including Mexico, Nigeria and Denmark have announced their first positive tests. The World Health Organization assesses the level of risk as “very high at global level”. But the scale and impact of the Covid-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December, remain deeply uncertain. That is because whle viral outbreaks have happened before, each one is different. While severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) had a higher death rate, Covid-19 appears to be more contagious. Its spread is already being determined in hard-to-predict ways by human behaviour. To limit the damage as far as possible, trust and information are of the essence. In the UK, as elsewhere, it is imperative that the government, and other public bodies, provide straightforward advice about travel and sanitation as well as the disease. For the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to say earlier this week that he would not travel to northern Italy was unwise because it contradicted official guidance. Instead, ministers must lead by example. In recent weeks Boris Johnson has appeared in public rarely. There are circumstances in which a cabinet minister is an effective substitute. But with a threatened pandemic, combined with ongoing floods, leadership is called for. The prime minister, who is often said to have harboured a lifelong ambition to head his country’s government, should now end its petty boycott of key BBC news programmes. It cannot be left to backbench Conservative colleagues such as the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt to encourage people to deal with these unpredictable events in a responsible way. This is all the more important when xenophobic outbursts have been reported, and when the risks associated with panic behaviours such as stockpiling are well known.
It is a missed opportunity and a mistake by Mr Johnson not to have called a Cobra meeting before Monday. Governments, businesses and institutions of all sorts face difficult decisions, based on balancing risks. Broadly speaking, these are the dangers of Covid-19 itself, weighed against the disruption caused by any measures, such as school closures or travel restrictions, that are taken to limit its spread. Individuals can find themselves confronting similar dilemmas and, within the parameters set out by advice from councils or employers, will behave differently. “Social distancing”, meaning avoiding hugging and kissing, is recommended. But the threat is not the same for everyone. While fit young adults are likely to recover should they catch Covid-19, older people and those with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable. Every family will contain people with different susceptibilities. Beyond the immediate risks to health, experts warn that a recession is likely. Markets have had their worst week since 2008 and central banks are less able to act in the face of a supply-side shock such as this, than they are when demand weakens. The unpredictability of the disease is magnified in the reactions to it of our interconnected global economic systems. It is impossible, too, to know what the political impact will be, except that it will surely be greater if nationalists seek to profit from the disruption to flows of capital, goods and people. But the worst outcomes may still be averted. Political leadership and clear communication are the immediate necessities.",2020-02-28 18:19:47+00:00,94573,2
94574,commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-donald-trump-truth-president,Opinion,Donald Trump’s war on coronavirus is just his latest war on truth | Jonathan Freedland,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-donald-trump-truth-president,"The coronavirus crisis is a war against a disease, but it’s also the most serious battle yet in the war on truth. That much was clear from the start, as China moved to hush up the first outbreak and gag the doctor who had spotted it. It was a classic case of what we might call Chernobyl syndrome: the tendency of authoritarian systems to react to disaster by rushing to downplay or cover up the problem, focusing more on shifting blame than tackling the threat head on. Viewers of last year’s TV dramatisation of the Chernobyl nuclear accident could recognise the pattern immediately, as the priority of those in charge becomes avoiding embarrassment rather than saving lives.
There was some of that in the Iranian reaction to the virus, as the country’s deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference called to reassure citizens, only later for it to be confirmed that he had himself been infected. (There were already suspicions, since Tehran’s official numbers didn’t add up.) And there was a grim logic to the fact that at the heart of the outbreak in South Korea is a religious sect similarly devoid of transparency. Usually, the democratic world can contrast itself flatteringly with such closed, controlled societies, proud that its approach to calamity is openness and the free flow of information. Indeed, crises like this one can serve as test cases for the competing merits of free systems v authoritarian ones. True, democracies cannot match Beijing’s ability to lock down whole cities and build an entire hospital in a week. But when it comes to a global pandemic, it’s free speech, full disclosure and cross-border scientific cooperation that ultimately save lives.
Except this time, the familiar authoritarian v democratic contrast has become muddled. That’s because the current leader of the world’s most powerful democracy, the US, has the same instincts as the authoritarian rulers he so admires, and those instincts have coloured his response to coronavirus. The result is that what for many must have seemed an abstract concern – Donald Trump’s assault on facts, experts and science – is now a matter of life and death. So while US medical officials have been at pains to brace Americans for the inevitability of coronavirus – a matter of when, not if – Trump and his outriders have worked hard to minimise the threat. On Thursday, Trump repeatedly referred to the figure of “15” cases in the US, when the actual figure was 60, and promised that that number would go down rather than up: “It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” Trump’s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, breezily assured the US public that the bug had been contained and that the country was sealed “pretty close to airtight” against the disease, when of course it is not. One of the administration’s most influential propagandists – for whom Trump paused his state of the union address this month so that his wife, Melania, might garland him with America’s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has been telling his vast audience that “the coronavirus is the common cold, folks”, and that it had been “overhyped” and “weaponised … to bring down Donald Trump”.
Trump has nodded in a similarly conspiracist direction, tweeting that the media are doing all they can “to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible”. That reference to the markets is key. Trump believes his chances of re-election in November hinge on his stewardship of the economy, betting that voters will back him if their pensions – linked to the stock market – are up. That the Dow Jones suffered the biggest one-day drop in its history on Thursday has him rattled. And so his first instinct is that of the Manhattan hustler-hotelier loudly assuring guests that the strong smell of burning coming from the ground floor is merely the chef trying out a new barbecue rather than a sign that the building is on fire. Crucial to that effort is talking loudly over the fire marshals, or even gagging them altogether. You could see that when Trump spoke in the White House briefing room, brazenly contradicting the experts by his side. But it’s now become formal policy, with Trump’s insistence that all federal officials – including those with deep scientific expertise – are to say nothing that has not first been authorised by the White House. Note the fate of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. On Thursday he dared say that “we are dealing with a serious virus” with a higher mortality rate than regular flu. That was deemed insufficiently upbeat for the great leader. According to the New York Times, “Dr Fauci has told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.” The new mantra, it seems, is to be one of Trump’s favourite phrases: repeated again on Thursday: “Nobody really knows.” That could be the motto of post-truthists such as Trump, conveying the hope that voters will become confused, concluding that no truth is ever even possible, and that in the fog of information and rumour it’s best simply to trust the man in charge. That’s what Trump wants every American to believe, about coronavirus and everything else for that matter: nobody really knows.
Now Trump has put his slavishly deferential vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the coronavirus effort. Put aside Pence’s appalling record as governor of Indiana, when his response to an HIV outbreak was to veto a medically recommended needle exchange programme and to offer his prayers instead. Focus instead on the fact that Pence has been appointed over the head of the health secretary, Alex Azar, whom Trump deemed too “alarmist”. In that same spirit, Trump has gutted the very agencies that the US will now desperately rely on. In 2018, he slashed health spending by $15bn, binning the Obama-era programmes and teams established for the express purpose of leading the US response to a pandemic. Among those cut: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – now in the frontline against coronavirus – which was forced to reduce by 80% its efforts to prevent global disease outbreak. The consequences are clear enough: only eight of the US’s 100 public-health labs are now even able to test for Covid-19.
This onslaught against the health agencies is of a piece with Trump’s entire approach to data, science and truth. You might remember “Sharpiegate”, when the president all but got out a black marker pen and amended a map issued by the key US meteorological agency so that it appeared to support his tweeted, and false, claim that Alabama was about to get hit by a hurricane. Trump has installed cronies and business pals at the helm of a raft of agencies previously respected as providers of neutral, factual data, the better to ensure those bodies say only what he wants them to say. He has moved to shrink their budgets – whether at the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps or the Census Bureau – and allowed experts with deep knowledge to retire and not be replaced. We can’t say we weren’t warned. On Trump’s first full day in office, he telephoned the head of the National Park Service, angered by photographs showing that crowds that had gathered for his inauguration the previous day were smaller than those for Barack Obama. The head of the NPS duly passed on the instruction from the president, and new, more flattering images appeared. We laughed about it at the time because it was so petty, so vain and so trivial. But the mindset was clear. The US president is a man who does not want the facts or the truth. He wants only what makes him look good. That impulse might not have mattered much in January 2017. But it matters gravely now. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",2020-02-28 18:16:47+00:00,94575,2
94759,commentisfree/2020/feb/28/sensationalist-media-is-exacerbating-racist-coronavirus-fears-we-need-to-combat-it,Opinion,Sensationalist media is exacerbating racist coronavirus fears. We need to combat it | Jing Zeng,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/sensationalist-media-is-exacerbating-racist-coronavirus-fears-we-need-to-combat-it,"Epidemics bring out the best and worst of social media. In the past two months, I have seen pseudo-scientific “cures” for the Covid-19 proliferating on WeChat, conspiracy theorists on Gab propagating various “truths” about the source of the outbreak, and young Tik Tokers video-sharing “funny” memes about the virus. On the flipside, I have witnessed the development of numerous campaigns fighting back against a parallel epidemic of #coronaracism. Since knowledge of the outbreak first occurred, disheartening incidents have been reported in Australia, Europe, and the US of people of east Asian appearance being verbally abused, kicked off public transport, denied entrance to shops, spat on and even violently attacked.
Even as I write this, there are reports of attendees at Melbourne’s Royal Children’s hospital refusing to allow Asian doctors to treat their kids.
“Less than 0.001% of Chinese people have coronavirus, yet more than 99.999% have already experienced coronaracism.” This quote from British-born Chinese comedian Ken Cheng underlines pervasive and indiscriminate nature of the racism stemming from this outbreak. In January 2020, the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus was coined by the French Asian community on Twitter in response to a spate of racially motivated attacks in the country. Following a successful debut on the French Twittersphere, this hashtag campaign was quickly translated into English, German, Italian, Spanish and appeared across various platforms. On Instagram, for instance, Taiwanese-Spanish musician Chenta Tsai posted a picture of the phrase scrawled across his torso on the runways of Madrid Fashion Week. The campaign has even prompted a Chinese band to published an EP – Wo bushi Bingdu (“I am not a virus” in Chinese).
In Australia, where 5.6% of the population can claim Chinese ancestry (census 2016), journalist Avani Dias introduced the #DontDumpTheDumplings hashtag on 13 February, calling on Australians to continue to frequent their local Chinese restaurants, whose businesses have reportedly suffered tremendous losses due to lack of patronage. Only a few days later, progressive political activist group GetUp launched a campaign with the same intention on Instagram and Twitter. Their hashtag #iwilleatwithyou borrows its nomenclature from the successful anti-Islamophobia campaign following the 2014 Sydney Lindt cafe siege. As a member of the Chinese diaspora who has experienced xenophobia amid the outbreak myself, I find all of these aforementioned social media campaigns uplifting. However, these campaigns face many obstacles, two of which are fear-spreading and rumour-mongering. In times of crisis, fear fosters discrimination. During epidemics, avoidance and stigmatisation of out-groups are common strategies of collective coping. Anthropological and historical accounts of past epidemics provide plenty of evidence of fear “legitimising” collective discrimination against minorities and other “outsiders”. For instance, during the 1853 yellow fever epidemic in America, Irish and German immigrants were blamed as the cause. In the 1916 major outbreak of polio in New York City, Italian immigrants were accused of bringing the epidemic to the US. During the early phases of the outbreak of Covid-19, the denigration and blaming of groups deemed responsible for the outbreak was already plain to see within China. Shortly after the new coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province was officially declared by Chinese authorities in January, discriminatory rhetoric and attacks against people from the region began to emerge online and in public. For instance, pictures of banners stigmatising people travelling back home from Hubei went viral on social media. A widely circulated picture shows a banner in Shanghai with the message: “People coming back from Hubei are all time bombs”.
Sensationalist media coverage of the outbreak works to further exacerbate existing fears, including some deliberately pandering to xenophobic stereotypes or peddling popular rumours. Perhaps the most widely publicised example of the latter was the emergence of a video of “a Chinese woman indulging in the apparently common practice of eating fruit bat soup”. Although this video has been debunked, it is still circulated online, promoting the narrative that Chinese people deserve their affliction by dint of their “disgusting” eating habits.
A more recent example of misinformation fuelling xenophobia is the conspiracy theory claiming the latest Covid-19 outbreak in Italy is caused by Chinese “big pharma” and government who deliberately sent virus carriers to Europe. Fear, rumour and xenophobia are three intimated linked issues, and one sustains the other. As the outbreaks continue to spread, so do panic, new rumours and tension across communities. As of Thursday, Covid-19 has reached 40 countries. As the world is preparing for a pandemic, maybe we should also prepare for combating a #coronaracism pandemic so we can all fight the virus in solidarity.

Although he hadn’t travelled to China, he had taken a plane home with others who were returning from Beijing. A few days before his voluntary quarantine was set to expire, he visited his office to fetch a library book and ran into a colleague. Why did he take the risk? And was his colleague, who knew about the situation, concerned about contagion? People are often optimistic about risks. In the field of risk perception, we call this an “optimism bias”; people may think they can control their own exposure to diseases, that they don’t need a vaccine because they aren’t susceptible to flu, or that they won’t transmit their cold to others. Our friend was confident he couldn’t be a vector for coronavirus, or Covid-19; likewise, one of our family members recently flew across the country with a severe respiratory ailment, insisting that her mask and careful handwashing would protect those around her on the plane.
It’s impossible to be completely certain about the risks of Covid-19. We don’t yet know enough about the length of its incubation period, how the disease is transmitted or what makes some people more susceptible than others to it. And there’s even greater uncertainty about what policy responses are most appropriate – did China’s decision to quarantine entire cities help prevent the spread, or exacerbate it? Is Italy’s decision to fine people caught entering or leaving outbreak areas “draconian”, or necessary? Uncertainty is the root of many anxieties about the virus. Current estimates suggest that seasonal influenza is a greater public health threat than Covid-19, but our uncertainty about coronavirus – seemingly new, mysteriously contagious and quickly spreading across Europe – feeds into how we perceive risk. If people are overconfident in the protective benefits of any one particular action, they may end up doing things that are risky, or even counterproductive. The Ebola epidemic in 2014 showed how peoples’ social biases can influence their ability to stay healthy. Some doctors, who wanted to help people as quickly as possible, rushed to aid patients without wearing protective clothing, and subsequently contracted the disease. Many people in Europe and the US have begun wearing surgical masks to protect against coronavirus. According to experts, the value of surgical masks depends entirely on the context in which they’re used: a surgical mask won’t work unless it’s worn consistently and properly. If worn incorrectly, their utility quickly plummets. We touch our faces, noses and eyes many times a day, making it difficult to completely avoid contact with infection. Though face masks may provide the feeling of security, masks are most valuable in situations where they are necessary – such as among frontline health workers. One woman we observed recently on a flight was continuously adjusting her face mask, pulling it aside to talk to her husband (who wasn’t wearing a mask), and touching several communal surfaces after rubbing her eyes. If her objective was to immunise herself from Covid-19, she could have directly exposed herself. If she was attempting to protect others from her own respiratory illness, she did the opposite. And by depleting the global stock of face masks, those in the west – who are currently at low risk of contracting coronavirus – may be using up resources that could be needed elsewhere. The World Health Organization recently warned that stockpiling face masks could lead to a global shortage – hampering the fight against the spread of the virus.
When we’re uncertain about something, we often rely upon our feelings and prior experiences in place of information. Surgical face masks offer the sense, however illusory, of protection. Moreover, a climate of uncertainty can cause misinformation to flourish. This is why clear messaging from trusted sources, and guidance on what to do and how to do it, is essential during a pandemic. Our perceptions of risk can lead us to view severe policies, such as restrictions on travel, as an appropriate precaution. Yet drastic responses have knock-on effects: China’s economy has taken a huge hit since coronavirus, affecting global markets. People of Asian descent across the world are experiencing unfounded stigma. And austere measures, such as travel bans and quarantines, may impede access to healthcare supplies and resources at the time when they’re needed the most. Rather than prevent coronavirus, our perception of risk may help it spread. • Ann Bostrom is a professor in environmental policy and Nicole Errett is a lecturer in the department of environmental and occupational health at the University of Washington",2020-02-26 16:16:52+00:00,95087,2
95271,commentisfree/2020/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-coronavirus-buying-time-can-save-lives,Opinion,The Guardian view on the new coronavirus: buying time can save lives | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-coronavirus-buying-time-can-save-lives,"It now appears almost inevitable that the new coronavirus outbreak will soon be identified as a global pandemic. There has been a surge in cases in Iran, South Korea and Italy, and incidents confirmed in numerous countries, in addition to the almost 80,000 cases seen in China. The World Health Organization argues that it is not a pandemic – spreading internationally in an uncontrolled way – because it is cautiously optimistic that China’s outbreak may have peaked thanks to the strict measures adopted by Beijing. Others say this is already a pandemic in all but name. The WHO’s hesitance may be partly due to its concern about the public reaction, as rational worries combine with limited medical knowledge, xenophobia and broader anxieties. “Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,” the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned on Monday. As concern spreads, economic effects are growing alongside the human toll. Stock markets have taken a hammering. Airlines are suffering, major international events are being cancelled, and companies dependent on Chinese-made components have halted production. How much worse could it get? “This might be bad,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday. The word “pandemic” brings to mind the devastation of the Black Death or Spanish flu. But not all pandemics are equal. The term tells us how a disease is spreading, not how deadly it will be. Spanish flu killed up to 100 million people as it swept the globe a century ago. According to one estimate, the 2009 swine flu pandemic killed up to 203,000 people – still lower than the toll linked to seasonal flu in many years. The impact of a pandemic depends to a great extent on the characteristics of the disease, the capacity of health services, and the response to the outbreak. The new coronavirus appears to be highly transmissible, possibly through asymptomatic carriers, and the WHO has quoted a mortality rate of 2%. But even in China the rate appears to be far lower outside Wuhan, where health services have not been overwhelmed by demand, and where medics had advance warning. Britain has long prepared for a flu pandemic. Other countries, with poor sanitation, struggling health systems and malnourished populations, could pay a far higher price: it is in everyone’s interests to make sure they get the support they need. Panic and resignation are understandable responses to the declaration of a pandemic, but what is needed is vigilance and sensible action. It would still be possible to slow the disease’s spread, for example through bans on mass gatherings, or advice to vulnerable populations to isolate themselves – allowing more time to train medics, acquire supplies (hit by disrupted production in China as well as by panic-buying) and prepare extra beds, as well as to develop treatments and – hopefully – a vaccine. The priority for the public in countries such as the UK should be good hygiene and the observation of official advice.",2020-02-25 18:37:15+00:00,95272,2
95372,commentisfree/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-lockdown-chinese-social-media-laughter-anger,Opinion,"Amid the coronavirus lockdown, Chinese social media is full of laughter and anger | Yuan Ren",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-lockdown-chinese-social-media-laughter-anger,"In many ways, the coronavirus outbreak in China has been one big social experiment, testing the thesis: what happens when an entire country goes into hibernation for weeks? Since the outbreak was officially announced more than a month ago, less than one-third of China’s 300 million migrant workers have returned to work a fortnight after the lunar new year break; 270 million children, according to China’s official news agency, are staying home as schools remain shut throughout China. There’s strictly no congregating – or socialising – in this new world order. Many cities have banned public gatherings altogether, and official advice has been “Stay in, don’t go out unless necessary”, resulting in many empty streets. Nationwide, cinemas are closed and performances at Beijing’s top arts venues have been cancelled until April. Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million, remains in lockdown. As a result, online social activity and subcultures have bloomed, and state media has joined in too.
To begin with, it was memes showing bats in soup, or people eating the animals whole, as health authorities announced that bats may have been the source of the viral outbreak. But as celebrations for new year slowed down, hashtags such as #whattodowhenstuckathome and #learnanewskill trended on Weibo, China’s Twitter, giving life to a host of funny videos and entertainment. Recreating outdoor life indoors became a hit: a man sitting on a high chair in his living room “fishing” from his own goldfish tank; masked women dancing with doctors in Wuhan’s hospitals, reminiscent of the popular group-dancing seen in parks and public squares; Ferrero Rochers being flipped inside their box with cotton buds, a parody of the way that street food stalls cook popular octopus-ball snacks. People’s Daily made montages of the funniest clips, which also went viral on social networks. Cabin fever has meant that downloads of fitness apps such as Keep, and views of exercise videos on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) and its rival Kuaishou (or Kwai, overseas) soared. One man even reportedly ran a marathon in his flat, evidenced by the step counts he posted on social media. On the video-streaming site Bilibili, views of fitness content jumped by almost 50%. Videos of cats “cooking” – kneading dough with their paws – also gained a large following. The special restrictions seemed at first to create a burst of life online. A livestream showing the emergency construction of hospitals in Wuhan attracted millions of viewers, making stars of the tractors involved. On Weibo, each type of tractor has its own page and is ranked, with the “cement mixer” coming in at number three with 8,000 followers and the “small fork lifter” at number one with more than 40,000. The citizens of Wuhan seemed to have banded together in hard times. On 28 January, five days into the lockdown, synchronised chants of “Wuhan add oil” (a reference to car engines that functions as a rallying call), was heard across the city’s apartment blocks, pre-organised by residents’ groups on WeChat. The rally was sustained for several minutes until someone suggested that all the shouting could increase airborne transmission. But as the number of coronavirus deaths jumped and the severity of its impact became apparent, discontent brewed. Then on 7 February, doctor Li Wenliang, the “whistleblower” who first sounded the alarm of a “Sars-like” virus, died. The government’s mishandling of the situation was already facing intense scrutiny – news outlets such as Caixin published a series of in-depth analyses of the delayed response to the virus. The fact that Dr Li had been gagged by police for speaking the truth and trying to alert others led to an outpouring of anguish online. Many blamed his death on the government’s failure to provide medical workers with adequate protection. The hospital where Li died denied his death for hours after it was first reported, fuelling further resentment. The hashtag #wewantfreedomofspeech had nearly 2m views on Weibo before it was deleted. As rage erupted, censors quickly waded in, deleting posts, shutting down accounts and group discussions. Several hours after Li’s death, the social media landscape already seemed more pacified.
Many examples of “negative news” online about the outbreak have now disappeared. An article that was titled “If there were bolder media outlets, could the coronavirus outbreak have been avoided?” is inaccessible; the poplar Weibo account of the Wuhan writer Fang Fang, who wrote about what she saw in Wuhan, was shut down. While citizen journalists and news agencies continued exposing “the reality” inside Wuhan, they faced a new level of repression. A man called Fang Bin who shot scenes inside local hospitals showing body bags is thought to have been arrested. In recent weeks state media has ramped up its efforts to portray unity and boost patriotism. On the last day of lunar new year, a day after Li’s death, buildings in Beijing lit up in red with “Wuhan add oil”. Similar light displays marked the Communist party’s 70th anniversary in October last year. Today, social media is still awash with entertaining videos, many portraying acts of selflessness. A short video showing a guard at a “coronavirus test station” in a thick army coat in the blustery, snowy landscape has been viewed millions of times. Xinhua, China’s official news agency, has found its own protagonists of this blitz spirit, such as the crying guard who sits on the ground eating his lunch but jumps up seconds later “when duty calls”, or an Egyptian family who “chose” to stay in Wuhan.
A series of star-filled songs about the outbreak have added to the culture of positivity and patriotism. Jackie Chan sings on both Wuhan, are you OK? and Believe Love Will Triumph. For now, while plenty bemoan the censor’s heavier hand, government channels remain essential sources of information and updates. The truth is that most people are not interested in being controversial, and are just trying to pass the time and are happy for a morale boost. Yesterday, a friend urged me not to ask too many questions about coronavirus on WeChat, as it has become “too sensitive”. But beyond the funny memes and songs of unity, you can still find devastating personal stories – the disease has now claimed 2,592 lives in China. Long after posts are deleted, their screenshots linger: look and you can still find reposted threads and articles detailing families torn apart, and gravely sick patients unable to access treatment. • Yuan Ren is a former editor at Time Out Beijing, and has written extensively on China",2020-02-25 11:14:35+00:00,95373,2

The contest had been hidden from the public until swine flu, the first global influenza pandemic for more than 40 years, hit the UK in 2009. This outbreak was contained with fewer than 500 deaths. Britain was lulled into a false sense of security that its infection control measures would be enough to contain a new infectious disease. Governments pursued a course of mitigation, where it is accepted a deadly disease will spread but the losses are bearable. This was true of Labour and Conservative governments. Alan Johnson, health secretary in Gordon Brown’s administration, admitted to a peers’ inquiry in 2009 that at the “peak of a ‘reasonable worst-care scenario’ pandemic, intensive care capacity may well be inadequate”. That this calculation had not changed since is the reason for the extreme lockdown we are enduring. What has altered is the nature of the threat. Covid-19 is 50 times more deadly than swine flu. It is far more easily transmitted. The world is more globalised, heightening the risk of rapid spread of the virus, especially one that travels with close contact. These were all quantifiable risks. It is disastrous that such a virus has been left to spread untracked around the country. This would have tested any health system, let alone one running close to full capacity and groaning under a winter flu season. Our shortcomings are now being painfully exposed. The global demand for the ventilators that help severely ill coronavirus patients to breathe looks almost certain to outstrip supply. Plans for homemade machines are being drawn up on the fly. Frontline medics complain they are putting their lives at risk because of a lack of protective equipment. The failure to act fast enough lies behind the testing fiasco. Testing is central to reducing the fatality rate, because it leads to early detection. It allows transmission to be curbed and for resources to be pointed rapidly to the infected. But to test requires staff, equipment and chemicals. The worry is that the NHS does not have enough trained workers to operate the tests. Then there are concerns over supply. Lombardy in Italy, one of hardest-hit places in Europe, is home to one of the largest makers of testing swabs. There is a worldwide race to secure the chemical reagents required for the kits. Michael Gove acknowledged on Tuesday evening that Britain has much ground to make up in order to copy South Korea’s successful rollback strategy. Yet Seoul’s achievement was founded on mass-sourcing reagents in January when they were plentiful. Now it’s much tougher, as Jean-François Delfraissy, the immunologist who heads France’s Covid-19 response, warned this month. He said France had “a huge problem with the reagents used in the tests. These basic reagents are from China and the United States. The production of machines stopped in China and the US keeps the [reagents] for itself.” What is required is more international cooperation to prevent these rivalries from causing avoidable deaths. China has a crucial role to play, having experienced five respiratory virus epidemics in 20 years. The success of Germany’s well-resourced public health system in handling the outbreak ought to be a model to emulate. David Alexander, professor of risk at University College London, told the New Statesman that pandemic preparation involves “telling governments what they don’t want to know, to spend money they don’t have, on something they don’t think will happen”. Every year, 600,000 people die in the UK. If unchallenged, Covid-19 threatens to almost double that and overwhelm the NHS. In the face of uncertainty, it’s appropriate for government to be resilient to extreme events. The science may not be black and white, and no one can possess perfect actuarial clarity. But this crisis has shown us how we can – and must – insure against the uncertainty.",2020-03-31 18:38:50+00:00,96308,2
96369,commentisfree/2020/mar/31/people-colour-covid-19-laws-police-track-record,Opinion,Can people of colour trust the UK Covid-19 laws with the police's track record? | Gracie Mae Bradley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/people-colour-covid-19-laws-police-track-record,"On Monday, in the midst of a global pandemic that has seen at least 1,408 people die in the UK alone, No 10 was forced to clarify that, contrary to some claims by police, it is indeed still legal to buy and sell Easter eggs. This came hot on the heels of Derbyshire police shaming walkers in the Peak District on social media, attempts to fine a bakery in London for drawing social distancing lines on the pavement outside, and south Wales police scolding an MP for dropping off groceries to his elderly father. As if the spectacular measures in the Coronavirus Act passed last week weren’t enough, the government chose on Thursday to establish emergency rules under the Public Health Act 1984. These rules stipulate that we must have a reasonable excuse to leave our homes and that with a few exceptions, gatherings of more than two people in a public place are forbidden. The punishment for breaking the rules is either a fixed penalty notice or potentially a criminal conviction, with the police empowered to make us go home and if necessary, use force to do so. The current situation is being further complicated by discrepancies between government guidance and the letter of the law.
What is clear is this: we are now all presumed absconders until we demonstrate otherwise. Yet, as with every universal restriction on liberty, the effects of this new state of emergency will not be felt evenly. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, yesterday urged police to “use their discretion” in enforcing the new rules. Even on a purely liberal analysis, that is not how the law works. Police have a clear set of rules that they can enforce, and enforcement beyond those rules is outside the scope of their powers and unlawful. As the police monitoring group Netpol remarked yesterday, arbitrary policing wasn’t suddenly invented last week. While some white people may be surprised by the inconsistent way in which the new powers are being enforced, communities of colour already know that police discretion is a gift not bestowed equally. There is a long history of police power being deployed as a disciplinary tool against communities of colour, from the sus laws of the 1970s (the stop and search laws) to the more recent response to serious youth violence, which included calls for armed police patrols on inner city estates, and even deployment of the army. The recent reports of coronavirus policing brought to mind a 2018 report by StopWatch, which explores the experiences of young people of colour arbitrarily included on the Metropolitan police’s gangs list, for whom being stopped and searched is as normal as “putting your clothes on”. For some young people of colour, then, daily life was already locked down well before coronavirus arrived. Far from being the solution, police discretion is actually part of the problem. For black people in England and Wales, police discretion looks like us being subject to 16% of police uses of force – and 20% of electro-shock weapon usage – despite being just over 3% of the population. Police discretion is us being nearly 10 times more likely than a white person to be stopped and searched, despite being no more likely than people of other ethnicities to be found with prohibited items. It is the Met’s gangs database being comprised of 78% black people, despite only 27% of people responsible for serious youth violence in the capital being black. It’s therefore not unreasonable to worry that people of colour who are actually obeying the new rules may nevertheless find themselves targeted by the police for perceived infractions. Physical distancing is clearly vitally necessary in protecting the many people in our communities for whom this virus would prove fatal. But we should not fall into the trap of thinking that policing alone can achieve the enormous social change that is needed to see us through this public health crisis – especially if headlines about bans on seasonal confectionery continue. Any attempt at prioritising coercive power over a public health response won’t just undermine the immediate aim of suppressing Covid-19. If communities of colour are left to bear the brunt of arbitrary policing, the damage done will last even when this crisis is over. • Gracie Mae Bradley is policy and campaigns manager for Liberty",2020-03-31 14:58:34+00:00,96370,2
96399,commentisfree/2020/mar/31/egypt-coronavirus-transparency-sisi-crackdown,Opinion,Egypt's disdain for transparency will backfire in this coronavirus crisis | Timothy Kaldas,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/egypt-coronavirus-transparency-sisi-crackdown,"During a public health crisis, a government’s credibility is a vital asset. To slow the spread of a virus, the government must convincingly inform and instruct the public. And to do this, it must inspire trust – trust that it is following the science, acting out of the interests of the population, and enforcing measures that will help to keep the public safe. Trust depends on transparency. If governments appear to be concealing the truth, or withholding information, their credibility can quickly crumble. The Egyptian government has long seen transparency as a weakness, and guarded information as though it were a national security threat. Much like Donald Trump’s White House, Egypt’s leaders have responded to reports about the estimated number of coronavirus infections as though they were a personal attack, rather than a health crisis the entire world is struggling to contain.
Anyone found spreading “rumours” about the coronavirus now faces imprisonment and fines. Websites have been censored and the government has sought to silence journalists. Egyptian officials recently expelled the British Guardian journalist Ruth Michaelson following her report on mathematical modelling that indicated Egypt’s number of actual infections may be far higher than the official figures. At the time of Michaelson’s report, Egypt’s ministry of health claimed there were a total of 126 confirmed infections. Rather than respond to the study’s contention, Egyptian officials condemned the Guardian for reporting it, expelled Michaelson and rebuked the New York Times’ Cairo bureau chief, Declan Walsh, for deigning to even tweet about the study. An environment of opacity and suspicion has made the Egyptian government into its own worst enemy, and aggravated what Egyptian officials seemingly fear: that the world could suspect they are covering up the real scale of infections. By expelling a journalist who reported on the country’s coronavirus cases, the government has invited others to wonder what it has to hide. It may have nothing to hide at all. Thus far, there is no evidence of an orchestrated cover-up of infections. Egyptian authorities responded faster and more aggressively than their counterparts in the UK, shutting schools and universities weeks ago. The government has halted flights and pledged a coronavirus package of 100 billion Egyptian pounds to combat the virus. Moreover, no country can claim a perfect response – the scientific consensus about the virus is still emerging, and nobody yet knows how much devastation it will ultimately wreak. Egypt could have acknowledged that most countries undoubtedly have more infections than confirmed numbers, because testing is still limited. The UK itself is contending with two dramatically different models: one from Imperial College London researchers, who argue the country is still early in its fight with the virus, and another from researchers at Oxford University, which suggests that as much as half the population (over 30 million people) may have already been infected. In the absence of data about the virus, such models are partly reliant on assumption and speculation, as has been argued in the Guardian. Rather than concede the complexity of the subject, debate the merits of these claims or explain their views on the matter, Egypt’s government lashed out at the reports, intensifying suspicions that it had something to hide. Indeed, its persistent aversion to transparency has led many observers and foreign governments to view most official claims with a degree of suspicion. When Isis downed a Russian passenger jet over Sinai in 2015, Egypt spent several months denying what countless governments had already concluded was true: Isis’s affiliate in Sinai, Wilayat Sinai, was responsible. But Egyptian investigators pressed on, insisting there was no evidence of terrorism or foul play. Several months after the attack, Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, casually acknowledged that the plane was brought down by terrorists in a speech about the economy. To this day, conclusions from the investigation have not been made public. The government’s strict insistence that nothing be said until its conclusions were published now seems like an effort to delay discussion until the matter was forgotten.
But terrorist attacks have plagued other countries. Fatal security failures are a regular feature of our era. Admitting to failures, and working openly with other countries to resolve them, would have helped to build confidence in Egypt’s government. Instead, by spending months denying and obfuscating, many countries questioned whether Egypt was truly committed to improving airport security. Not only was the government’s response harmful – it was also unnecessary. After the Sinai incident, Egypt took steps to improve airport security, which has continued to be far more stringent than before the crash. But the damage to its reputation had already been done, and would last for years. Flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh only resumed in February, and Russia still doesn’t permit flights to the Red Sea resort town. It’s the same story with coronavirus. The government would do far better by responding transparently to concerns, and being open about the measures it is taking. During a pandemic, transparency is not a liberal luxury, but a vital feature of effective governance. • Timothy E Kaldas is an independent risk adviser and nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy",2020-03-31 11:51:40+00:00,96400,2
96435,commentisfree/2020/mar/31/us-china-coronavirus-diplomacy,Opinion,The US-China coronavirus blame game is undermining diplomacy,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/us-china-coronavirus-diplomacy,"As the world grapples with the human and economic devastation being wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, not even the relationship between the United States and China is being spared. However, the US and China cannot allow their global competition and rising tensions to impede efforts to fight the pandemic.
There will be time enough when this global emergency is over to figure out the ways in which the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) actions endangered the world by covering up the initial outbreak. But we are where we are, and China, the United States, and the rest of the world must focus on fighting the pandemic. Unfortunately, neither the US nor CCP leadership seems willing to resist throwing mud at one another. Donald Trump, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and other elected officials have called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and one White House official reportedly called it the “Kung Flu”. The Republican senator Tom Cotton hinted (without evidence) that the virus could be a bioweapon created by the CCP. In China, a spokesman for the PRC ministry of foreign affairs lied in suggesting that the US military could be to blame for the virus. Chinese government officials have echoed that sentiment while the CCP’s propaganda machine is busy promoting these conspiracy theories. This blame game is undermining diplomacy between the countries. Instead of calling his counterpart to coordinate responses to the global pandemic, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called China’s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, instead to object to “PRC efforts to shift blame for Covid-19 to the United States”. And the Trump administration has reportedly attempted to stop the UN security council and the G7 from taking action against the pandemic unless the groups singled out China for blame. It’s important to get the facts right. The virus started in China. In the early days, doctors tried to sound the alarm, but were not allowed to do their jobs. As the virus spread, the CCP censored many of those attempting to raise alarm bells. The CCP’s botched initial response to the virus probably made this pandemic far worse. But the priority for every nation right now must be the pandemic, and tensions between the world’s two biggest economies cannot get in the way. Toning down aspects of the US-China competition temporarily in no way means that the United States should ignore the CCP’s dangerous initial response to the virus, nor does it mean that the United States should stop blunting dangerous Chinese behavior elsewhere. What it means is taking concrete steps to ensure that the competition does not inhibit the fight against the pandemic. First, the United States must stop scapegoating China. Leaders need to stop referring to Covid-19 as the “Chinese virus”, trying to blame China for the outbreak and feeding conspiracy theories about China launching the disease on purpose. Halting this kind of rhetoric can help reduce some of the discrimination against Asian Americans that has been sparked by racist comments surrounding the virus. And while China will continue trying to spin this crisis to its advantage to win headlines, at the very least the United States can play the role of responsible leader rather than infantile finger-pointer.
Second, the United States must ensure that no policy that is intended to blunt nefarious Chinese behavior will negatively affect the fight against the pandemic. In order to address genuine concerns, the United States has increasingly scrutinized Chinese investment and private sector cooperation in education, scientific collaborations and the technology sector. Sometimes, those actions can have unintended consequences: for instance, ProPublica reported that one scientist – who had lived in the United States for decades and left the country after being investigated for ties to China – is now developing a rapid coronavirus test in China. Whether it’s scientists sharing research to find a vaccine or companies partnering to produce necessary equipment, we must ensure all the doors to cooperation on the pandemic are open right now. The Trump administration’s move to lift tariffs on Chinese medical products like masks and sanitization products is a good step. Third, the US and Chinese governments must work together to stem the tide of the pandemic. As tensions have risen in recent years there are fewer and fewer areas on which the two countries have pursued robust cooperation. But combating the pandemic is exactly the kind of challenge that requires the two nations to come together, from sharing lessons learned in their respective responses to searching for medical treatments to working together in multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization and the G20. And it means being open to support from one another: while China initially refused US help, reports now suggest the United States is declining China’s offers of sending personal protective equipment. Fourth, don’t worry for the moment about China’s attempts to win public relations victories by sending aid to US allies. The United States must focus on actually helping US allies – such as coordinating travel restrictions to avoid the disaster when the Europe travel ban was announced – and being supportive of allies getting desperately needed help from anywhere it can, whether the United States, China or anyone else. Even if the United States has relatively little to offer and China is sending small amounts of aid as a public relations move, responding by trying to remind everyone that China is the cause of the outbreak will only make America look petty (and some countries are already finding out on their own that part of China’s aid is faulty). If the United States and China are successful in fighting this pandemic – and doing so together – perhaps, at the end of all of this, the two countries just might end up building bridges that could be useful in tempering the more dangerous aspects of their competition.",2020-03-31 09:00:48+00:00,96436,2
96606,commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-austerity-politics-boris-johnson,Opinion,I've lived through plenty of social shocks –  this time we must learn the lessons | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-austerity-politics-boris-johnson,"Nothing will ever be the same again, they say. Everything will change. The Covid-19 outbreak raises the hope that Britain has learned its lesson. The shock of a long lockdown and the horror of morgues in freezer trucks should shake sense into us, surely? The prospect of dying alone among 4,000 strangers gasping for air in the ExCeL centre ought to jolt us into better ways. I hope so, but I don’t know so. I have lived through plenty of “nothing will ever be the same again” events – social shocks to the way we live, feel and think. Some great upheavals led to positive change: look how the Attlee government emerged from the deprivations of war. Aged five, I stood at the school bus stop in the great London smog of December 1952: no sunlight, fog so pea-soup thick we couldn’t see the bus to flag it down. Though as many as 12,000 died, good came of it. The Clean Air Act cured my wheezing winters of pre-penicillin bronchitis. But the lesson wasn’t learned for ever: 40,000 people a year die now from preventable air pollution in the UK.
Nuclear disarmers thought the Cuban missile crisis would be a “never again” learning moment, as Soviet ships steamed towards Armageddon – but it wasn’t. Instead, it was used as proof that mutually assured destruction works. Defeat in Vietnam should have taught the west that napalm and infinite firepower can’t win an asymmetrical war against weaker countries’ guerrillas. But they went on trying, with Afghanistan and Iraq repeating the same western nation-building fantasies. The great bank crash of 2008 was absolutely destined to end the financial greed and political hegemony of Thatcher’s 1980s big-bang city boys. But no. Bankers’ pay continued to rise, Sir Fred the Shred only lost his title. The price was paid by everyone else during a decade of austerity – and voters backed it in four elections. The result was an incapacitated public realm, naked in the blast of this epidemic. It wasn’t just the NHS and social care that were left unprepared, but every service crippled by cuts: public health, police, local government, the army and Whitehall – all denuded. Surely this time the lesson is well and truly learned? Don’t shrink the state, local or national, when nothing else stands between the people and penury or even death. Coronanomics shows all private commerce relies on the state in the last resort, and that borrowing on a gargantuan scale is not, after all, impossible when most needed. When even Boris Johnson proclaims there is such a thing as society, surely he can’t backtrack? But after a lifetime of disappointments and bitter political reverses, who can be sure this surprise Tory spending splurge will break the stranglehold of austerity thinking once and for all? So far, each time the Daily Mail logic has seemed vanquished by its own contradictions, it has weaselled its way back. But we have to live in hope or not live at all. Coronapolitics should guarantee the NHS returns to adequate funding: who would dare repeat the throttling it suffered in the past decade? After the BBC has proved itself most trusted for information, after its great resourcefulness in providing for locked-down children, and offering fitness classes, high culture and an archive of entertainment, who would dare threaten to “whack” it now? Beyond those national treasures, newly nationalised rail looks unlikely to return to its failed franchising. The Brexit transition must surely be prolonged, and the deal eased. Companies avoiding their fair share of tax look set for tougher treatment after these bailouts, likewise those businesses cheating on national insurance by using bogus self-employment, while cash-in-hand tax-avoiders have found out the hard way that they get no help in times of need.
Meanwhile, those who have long advocated a universal basic income for the first time have a genuinely solid case, as emergency support schemes and the faulty benefits system leave too many starving. Expect the epidemic to force a fast solution to the festering social care crisis after a do-nothing decade. How about the climate? Now we see the air clear across the world and Venice canals turn blue, a life without car, cruise ship and air-traffic pollution looks suddenly possible. As Extinction Rebellion calls off its planned spring actions, the virus makes its case instead. But pause your optimism there for a sobering thought. The other side is investing in its own coronapolitics too, with the libertarian right ready to pounce, especially on the climate crisis. The Global Warming Policy Forum of Nigel Lawson uses the virus to call for immediate cancellation of £15bn worth of climate-saving energy costs, such as the renewables obligation and the climate change levy. Just watch who’s tweeting and re-tweeting blame-the-EU and blame-the-UN messages. Brexiters relish the EU’s early failure to help member states. The Taxpayers’ Alliance, a perennial enemy of the overseas aid budget, has called for it to be diverted to corona work. Despite the crippling 40% cut in local government funds, it wants corona cuts in council tax, as it always does. Deregulators are having a field day as inspections and regulations in all sectors are abandoned: suspending physical inspections of livestock in the Red Tractor scheme pleases the farmers. Now Farmers Weekly has called for footpaths to be shut down across their land, for fear of infection. Under cover of the virus, all manner of things may be done that may not be undone. In the Times, Mark Littlewood, the director of the Institute for Economic Affairs, sees a “silver lining” in the waiving of the working time directive, driving-hours limits for lorry drivers, a pause in the 5p plastic bag charge and competition law suspended so food companies can collude. “Perhaps they should become permanent features of our regulatory landscape,” he writes. So the virus is an easy pretext to double down on familiar agendas. No surprise that the Jehovah’s Witnesses gleefully announce this pestilence proves we are living in the “final part of the last days”. The lessons seem blindingly obvious: never again leave the public realm so perilously weakened as we rely on it for everything, including life itself. Never again let this grossly under-taxed and unequal country tolerate an economy that leaves half the population unable to weather storms. Let’s hope enough people are shocked by the social deficits this virus has revealed. But then, looking back on past times when crises seemed to augur a better future, remember that old football fans’ adage: it’s the hope that kills you.

96704,world/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/lockdown-china-coronavirus-outbreak,Opinion,"As the west is in lockdown, China is slowly getting back to business | Daniel Falush",https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/lockdown-china-coronavirus-outbreak,"When China shut down its economy at the end of January to try to control the coronavirus outbreak, it was a bold and terrifying experiment. No one had tried anything similar. It was unclear whether the virus’s spread could be curbed, let alone halted. It was also possible that, as a respiratory virus with highly variable symptoms, coronavirus was simply too transmissible and too difficult to detect for these measures to work. But work they did and now China is the first nation to enter into the next phase of the pandemic – attempting to reinstate everyday life against the backdrop of coronavirus. But how much can economic life and daily freedom be restored without risking a “second wave” of the virus? Since I returned six weeks ago to my home in Shanghai from a trip to Europe, the city has progressively come back to life. First, the number of people on the streets started to increase. Then restaurants began to reopen and, slowly, filled up. As of this past week, it is no longer compulsory to wear a mask when going shopping or on public transport, and it is no longer compulsory for restaurants and shops to take the temperatures of customers, as they had been doing previously. Nevertheless, people here are still being careful. The only ones you see on the streets not wearing masks are old men, who never obeyed the rules anyway. Most venues still take temperature readings and do an increasingly good job. All of my recent readings have been between 36C and 37C – rather than the improbable 33C to 35C range I was registering a couple of weeks ago.
For the adventurous, there is even a bit of nightlife. I have gone clubbing twice in last six weeks. Steps in this direction though are slow and cautious. After announcing that cinemas would reopen this weekend, the authorities immediately announced they would close again after an uptick in reported cases. Meanwhile, stringent measures are in place reducing travel from the outside world. Scepticism exists in the west as to whether China has been as successful in suppressing the virus as it claims. What I can say concretely is this. The chief tools that China has used to control the outbreak are rapid detection and isolation of symptomatic cases, together with 14-day quarantining, normally at home, of everyone who is even remotely likely to have recently come into contact with them. The extensive army of busybodies responsible for detecting and isolating cases remains firmly in place, as do the frequently used apps that chart the positions of every known case, with a colour code indicating how long ago that case occurred. Red for less than a week ago, orange for between one and two weeks and yellow for more than two weeks. I do not believe there has been a cover-up. Covering up cases would render the tools used for controlling the outbreak ineffective. There might be a few local officials who are unwise enough to attempt it, but at the regional or national scale it appears extremely unlikely. As in every other country, there are caveats to interpreting the numbers, especially in badly affected regions, but the overall evidence is unequivocal: suppression has worked. China has had a few advantages over other countries in dealing with the outbreak, resulting from its social and political system. One is the ability to deliver consistent messaging. When the lockdown took place, the normal television schedule was suspended and replaced with wall-to-wall coronavirus coverage, devoted to the importance of not letting the disease spread. As a result, the people of China are, generally speaking, more afraid of catching the virus than of running out of food or losing their livelihoods. Whether or not Xi Jinping is personally scared of infection, I do not know, but he has done a disciplined job of behaving so. This falls in stark contrast to Boris Johnson, who caught Covid-19 himself after boasting of attending a hospital treating sufferers and shaking lots of hands. Xi waited until the outbreak was firmly under control before visiting Wuhan. When he spoke with patients and healthcare workers, he did so by video link, even keeping a healthy degree of social distancing from his microphone. Due to the broad adherence to government edict, a blanket lockdown has thankfully never been necessary in Shanghai or most other places in China. I, just like almost everyone else, stayed at home anyway.
Everything now could be, to a degree, harder in the west. It looks very much as if lockdowns will, on average, need to be longer and stricter than in China – with freedoms regained over a longer period. The numbers of cases in the population have been higher on the date at which lockdowns were imposed. Once the numbers of cases in the community are down to manageable levels, technological solutions – such as antibody tests and contact tracing – might do some of the job of the army of busybodies here. But until that point, mass physical distancing will remain necessary. In my own opinion, the costs of suppressing the outbreak are absolutely worth it. What many people on the right in the west, including Donald Trump, have failed to appreciate is that, in economic terms, harbouring coronavirus is unfeasible. Until a country has shown that it has brought transmission under control, normal economic life cannot resume. Tourists will not visit and international travel will not be permissible – meaning that, until they get coronavirus under control within their own borders, countries will not be able to again join the world community of freely trading nations. That community today seems to consist of China alone. • Daniel Falush is a professor at the Centre for Microbes, Development and Health at the Institute Pasteur in Shanghai",2020-03-30 05:00:14+00:00,96705,2
96849,commentisfree/2020/mar/29/in-a-national-crisis-people-are-desperate-to-believe-in-their-leaders,Opinion,"In a national crisis, people are desperate to believe in their leaders",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/in-a-national-crisis-people-are-desperate-to-believe-in-their-leaders,"In the early stages of the crisis, one of those at the heart of government decision-making told me: “We are all going to get it.” You wouldn’t wish a positive test for the coronavirus on anyone, but there is this to be said for the news that the prime minister, the Prince of Wales, and the health secretary now number among the infected, while the chief medical officer is self-isolating. There couldn’t be a more vivid illustration that this is an equal-opportunity virus that couldn’t care less about your status. A VIP protection squad of police officers is no defence from the invisible terrorist. It can get to you whether you are the leader of the country or the heir to its throne. The penetration of the coronavirus within the high black gates of Downing Street takes us into another situation that is unprecedented. After e-cabinet meetings and virtual news conferences and an online emergency summit of the G20, we have now witnessed the extraordinary first of the prime minister addressing the nation via Twitter video from quarantine. The breezy “hi folks” with which he began was intended to damp down any public fright that might be triggered by the virus reaching the highest levels of government. In an earlier era, Number 10 might have sought to conceal that the country’s leader had fallen ill and at such a critical juncture. During the Second World War, the British public weren’t told that Winston Churchill had had a heart attack while at the White House shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Two years later, Churchill contracted pneumonia, which was also kept from the country. That would be impossible now. In a crisis playing out in the era of 24/7 media, when daily bulletins are demanded of the nation’s leaders, concealment was never an option. “Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,” the prime minister declared. This reassurance about the functioning of the chain of command was extra necessary because there has been some unedifying background bickering within the cabinet about who is in charge of what. The spread of infection into the apex of the state does add dramatic heft to the ministerial mantra that “we are all in this together”. It is hoped within government that this will be persuasive on the stubborn minority of the population who have been putting themselves and others in potential danger by resisting the new rules on social distancing. If the infection of the head of government and the next head of state won’t persuade the irresponsible minority to take this menace seriously, it is a bit hard to know what will. There might have been fewer issues with securing comprehensive public compliance with social distancing had there not been too many days when the government issued advice that was confusing and contradictory. The prime minister himself has been particularly wanting in this respect. He urged people to stay away from at-risk relatives only then to tell reporters that he would be going to see his mother on Mother’s Day. Only on Monday did government messaging start to achieve the necessary clarity when Mr Johnson gave his television address, one watched live by 27 million people, ordering the national lockdown. If there is one further silver lining to his own infection, it is this. He was offered another opportunity to make amends for earlier chaotic messaging by reinforcing the “stay at home” injunction to the nation. There have been personal brickbats tossed at Mr Johnson since his infection was revealed, with some suggesting that he exposed himself to the virus by being cavalier about following his own government’s advice on social distancing. More significantly, there has been serious criticism of the government’s shifts in approach, and some fierce complaint from doctors and nurses about shortages of vital resources, especially protective equipment for health workers dealing with the infected and testing kits for frontline staff. Yet this has so far not come at any evident political cost to the government. Our Opinium poll today suggests that 92% of the public back the lockdown. Reflecting similar results from other survey organisations, the poll also indicates that trust in the prime minister has gone up. This probably has little to do with how the prime minister is objectively performing. Leaders of wildly varying characters presiding over differing responses to the pandemic are seeing a similar coronavirus popularity dividend. Emmanuel Macron has become better regarded among the French. Germans are more appreciative of Angela Merkel. Despite the grim state of affairs in Italy, Giuseppe Conte, the leader of its strange coalition government, has seen his approval rating leap from 44% in February to more than 70%. Donald “it’s going to disappear” Trump’s sensationally reckless responses to the crisis have been accompanied by a rise in his ratings. Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, has never been more popular. The Americans have a phrase for the impulse of people to want to unite behind their leaders at a time of emergency, especially when the threat comes with an existential dimension. They call it “rallying round the flag”. George W Bush saw a massive surge in his approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on the Twin Towers. John F Kennedy’s ratings soared during the Cuban missile crisis and in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs misadventure. About the latter, he quipped to friends: “The worse I do, the more popular I get.” We British lack an agreed term for this effect: “Hang on to nurse” would be particularly appropriate to the coronavirus crisis. Gordon Brown, generally a deeply unpopular prime minister, enjoyed a big surge in his ratings during the Great Crash in 2008. The more severe the emergency, the more the instinctive response of the public is to want to get behind its government. Fearful people need the comfort of thinking they are in the hands of capable leaders. In benign times, there is not much psychological cost to ourselves to regard politicians as useless knaves. In an emergency, many of us need to believe that there are smart people at the top who know what to do. This is accompanied by a desire for national solidarity, that yearning made manifest on Thursday night when so many people stood at their doors and windows to clap their salutations and thanks to NHS workers. The urge to pull together has also been demonstrated by the 700,000 applications to join the new NHS volunteers organisation. Shrewd opposition politicians understand this mood and grasp that the public are likely to react badly to anything that smells of petty point-scoring. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had every right to articulate legitimate anxieties about allowing construction projects to continue in the capital, but he was careful to use his voice in a tempered way. Labour’s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, made a fool of himself during the election, but has found redemption with a carefully calibrated, non-hyperbolic approach towards criticising the government. This means that, politically speaking, we are in the phoney war period of the crisis. Even when the government has made egregious blunders, such as over the procurement of additional ventilators, the opposition isn’t being very aggressive about it. Much of the public is willing to defer to authority and extend to the government a benefit of the doubt that it would not normally receive. This will not last for ever. The surge in approval enjoyed by Gordon Brown during the initial phases of the financial crisis faded away as national debate turned to issues about his stewardship of the financial system over the previous decade. There will one day be a great reckoning about the coronavirus, its origins, its spread and how it was tackled. Why wasn’t Britain better prepared for a pandemic? Was the health service inadequately staffed and equipped? Did the government initially underestimate the virulence of the disease and what that meant for the NHS? Was the prime minister too slow to order the lockdown and other critical steps? These are some of the questions that will preoccupy the inevitable inquiry the other side of this crisis. Boris Johnson’s currently buoyant approval ratings tell us nothing about what the public will think of him by the time this is over. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",2020-03-29 07:30:48+00:00,96850,2
96899,commentisfree/2020/mar/29/the-observer-view-importance-of-national-unity-coronavirus,Opinion,The Observer view on the importance of national unity,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/the-observer-view-importance-of-national-unity-coronavirus,"Last week, the BBC replayed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. The stars of that spectacle, you will remember, were a battalion of NHS nurses from Great Ormond Street hospital, who wheeled in hundreds of beds – complete with children in stripy pyjamas – and constructed a make-believe hospital before the world’s eyes. No moment at that London Games, not the grit of Mo Farah, not the grace of Jessica Ennis, provoked a more emotional surge of collective pride than that one. That “we can be heroes” spirit has been ignited in the country again, only this time in earnest. The hospitals that now – grimly – are being created before our eyes are those repurposed exhibition halls, the new Nightingale facility in east London and those planned in Birmingham and Manchester and Cardiff. The #clapforcarers moment at 8pm last Thursday saw the country emerging from behind its closed doors to applaud each and every act of compassion and bravery from those at the sharpest end of this pandemic, in a gesture of heart-swelling unity perhaps not felt since that heady sporting fortnight eight years ago. The prime minister has sometimes cast his rhetoric about the disease as a call to arms, but the British people have never needed war as an excuse to volunteer. This has long been a nation of collection tin shakers and Red Nose activists, of helpers for heroes and GoFundMe marathon runners. The volunteers – an extraordinary 700,000-plus and counting – who have stepped forward to provide a network of support for those 1.5 million fellow citizens most at risk prove that this determination is alive and kicking; even more courageous, perhaps, are those 7,000 former and retired doctors and nurses willing to return to intensive care. In recent years, it has often seemed that the splits opened by Brexit cast us into two implacable tribes. The past weeks show that there remain things about which we can nearly all agree: among them the selflessness of the NHS staff on whom we all depend, and the capacity for decency and kindness in communities up and down the land. Last week has proved, as Jo Cox so indelibly argued, that we still at heart “have more in common than that which divides us”. In the coming weeks, in which, as now seems horribly likely, we watch those new overflow hospitals and morgues pressed into service, that principle may be tested as never before in most of our lifetimes. Like all crises in the age of social media, this one offers constant opportunity to pick sides; to rage at lockdown transgressors and troll mercenary millionaires and yell at politicians on TV. More important, perhaps, for those of us who can save lives just by sitting on our sofas, to focus on the extraordinary work done on our behalf by all key workers, from carehome staff to refuse collectors. There is justified fear of what may be coming. We can hear that anxiety in the Skyped voices of our isolated parents and grandparents; we might sense it in ourselves. Even so, much has already been taken on board. Parents have taken up the challenges of home-schooling, teenagers have forgone social lives and summer plans, weddings have been shelved, house moves postponed. The monumental shift in national behaviour has so far been brought about not by sanctions and fines but by common sense and fellow feeling. As this crisis unfolds, we don’t need to unplug our memory of the short-sighted negligence of provision made in the name of austerity. Now, more than ever, a government that was elected playing fast and loose with figures must be held to its promises. But the weeks and months ahead will be less a political drama than a struggle waged in millions of individual lives up and down the land. It will be more quickly over if we hold in mind that, at our best, we remain all in it together.",2020-03-29 05:00:45+00:00,96900,16

I'm nervous – but I'm ready | Stephen Naulls,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/28/final-year-medical-student-frontline-coronavirus,"“So, we’re being conscripted?” On Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that 5,500 final year medical students would be joining the frontline of the NHS. On hearing this news, I rushed down the stairs of my flat to my equally bewildered housemates. We had just finished six years of medical school and had completed our hurriedly reorganised final exams remotely. But we weren’t supposed to officially qualify and start as doctors until August. NHS staff shortages and a hugely increased demand for care mean that we will be reaching for the scrubs early.
Starting on the lowest rungs, “foundation training” is the term for the first two years working as a doctor and serves as the culmination of a journey spanning over half a decade of medical school. Becoming a doctor is a dream I have had since I was 14 years old. But I can think of few things more nightmarish than starting my career in the middle of a global pandemic. I certainly feel a strong moral obligation to assist however possible in the midst of this unprecedented struggle. Many medical students, including those at my university, have completed their final examinations and were already actively seeking ways to volunteer before this was announced.
This sense of duty is nonetheless matched by fear and trepidation. A lack of testing means many healthcare workers are self-isolating at a time when demand looks set to soar. There is an overwhelming sense that the health service is heading towards a cliff edge, about to experience several months that will dwarf the winter crisis that has become an annual occurrence. Indeed, despite being highly trained, foundation doctors – the most junior of junior doctors in a hospital – still require significant senior supervision to support their development. I worry that the approaching challenges could place myself or one of my peers in a position where that support is not available, risking jeopardising patient safety through no fault of our own. Meanwhile, rumours continue to filter through of the “previously fit and well” patients now finding themselves on ventilators and I question if my colleagues’ pleas for adequate personal protective equipment will continue to fall on deaf ears. I speak to my dad, who’s back in Grimsby, on the phone. “Stephen, it’s like the war. You need to roll your sleeves up and get to work.” He’s right. Our medical schools would not graduate us, nor would the General Medical Council register us to work, if they had any doubts about our competence. We’re not being conscripted, but this does feel like a battle in which we all have our part to play.

Somehow, I was the only one in my local community to have missed the memo about last night’s clap for carers, a nationwide tribute to the NHS and care workers in these extraordinary times. And, before I knew it, I found that I was crying. As a junior doctor, I work in an NHS hospital with some inpatients who have been admitted with complications resulting from Covid-19. I have not yet been redeployed to an intensive-care unit, but I feel sure this is on its way. So the clap for carers was followed for me by an outpouring of love from friends and family, some of whom I haven’t spoken to in years, via phone calls and social media.
My Instagram feed was ablaze with similar stories from across the country. Yet that stirring national event wasn’t the only act of support and kindness I’d received that day. At work, the wards are dotted with letters from local schoolchildren telling us to keep going. Cafes near the hospital offer discounted coffees to NHS workers. A local pizzeria is providing free pizzas. A friend of my cousin’s brought in a big box of snacks and toiletries. It all means the world to us. I hope this experience has helped people to see how important the NHS is to each and every one of us. We all have a connection to our local NHS trust. It’s where most of us were born, and where some of us will die. For some of us, too, there are family connections. I happen to be employed in the same hospital where my grandparents worked as doctors during the blitz. My parents also met here at medical school. I was born in this hospital’s maternity ward, as was my niece. So for me, work also feels like home – and right now I couldn’t be prouder to feel part of it. There is no doubt that your local NHS trust will be experiencing an unimaginable strain on services at the moment. Staff across the country are being redeployed and wards being repurposed, sometimes overnight. We all know that more people are being admitted to hospital with complications from Covid-19 every day. I’m currently receiving training on how to best treat these patients. Meanwhile, I continue to tend to patients in my day-to-day area of speciality. I know that sometime soon I will be re-deployed: until then, I’ll keep up to date with new guidelines so that I’m as prepared as possible when the time comes. In short, we are doing everything we can at work to keep you all safe at home. What can you all do in return? If you live next door to a healthcare worker, send them a text to ask if they have everything they need. Don’t expect a reply. But know that it means the world. More than anything right now, shows of compassion and support hold special weight. Volunteer for the NHS, if you are healthy and able. The government’s call for volunteers was met with over half a million respondents in a matter of days, which in itself sends out a great message of encouragement to all those dedicating their time to tackling coronavirus. There will be plenty more opportunities to get involved as things develop.
Do not, under any circumstance, feel tempted to stockpile. Buy enough for you and your household, and not a tin more. Take my word for it, there is nothing more miserable than finishing a busy shift and finding your local supermarket has empty shelves. One evening, I had to rely on the kindness of my sister donating me some fresh fruit and veg to make a meal. But aside from that, let’s clap every Thursday at 8pm from inside our homes for the NHS and care workers. Most importantly, we should heed the official advice: stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. • Madeleine Openshaw is a junior doctor working in a city hospital",2020-03-27 20:03:45+00:00,97074,16
97231,commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-pandemic-americans-health-insurance,Opinion,Millions of Americans are about to lose their health insurance in a pandemic | Wendell Potter,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-pandemic-americans-health-insurance,"The tragic effects of our battle with the novel coronavirus are seemingly endless. But arguably the most mind-blowing is this: the very pandemic that threatens to infect and kill millions is simultaneously causing many to also lose their health coverage at their gravest time of need. Here’s how: the virus has caused a public health crisis so severe that people have been forced to stay home, causing businesses to shutter and lay off workers. And with roughly half of Americans getting their health insurance from their employer, these layoffs mean not only losing their income but also their medical coverage. In other words, just as our need for medical care skyrockets in the face of a global pandemic, fewer will have health insurance or be able to afford it. According to one recent report, the cost of treatment for Covid-19 can run around $35,000. As the patient in the report exclaimed: “I was pretty sticker-shocked. I personally don’t know anybody who has that kind of money.” So, how did we get to such a dire place? Many will sadly lose their jobs over the coming weeks – with one estimate projecting as many as 30%. And as they do, Americans are about to learn something horrifying: how irrational and irresponsible it is for so many to be dependent on employers for health insurance. Take it from me. I’m a former health insurance executive who once profited from this system. It’s time for it to stop. America needs to finally get out of the business of linking health coverage to job status. Even in better times, this arrangement was a bad idea from a health perspective. Most Americans whose families depend on their employers for coverage are just a layoff away from being uninsured. And now, when many businesses are shutting down and considering layoffs, it’s a public health disaster. Across the country we’re seeing reports of layoffs in almost all industries. As we approach a global recession, some analysts suggest that a million or more US workers will lose their jobs in April alone. Consider what this means for health care in this country. We’ve seen this before. During the last big recession, researchers at Cornell University found that 9.3 million Americans lost their health insurance between 2007 and 2009. Why? As people lost work, their employer-provided insurance went away. During this time, roughly six in 10 Americans who lost their jobs became uninsured. And this problem compounds itself. If the reason you lost your health insurance is that you no longer have steady employment, how are you now going to be able to afford monthly premiums for some other private health care plan? This problem becomes particularly acute when you consider that premiums for health plans sold on exchanges are projected to soar, as well, due to “unexpected Covid-19 costs”. It’s worth noting that even in good times, the employer-based model fails to cover enough of us, with the number of Americans covered through an employer steadily dropping in general. Since 1999, the percentage of those with job-based coverage has declined by nine points. And it most certainly will drop like a rock in the coming weeks and months. It’s now clear that this system cannot handle our current reality. With so many Americans sadly on the verge of unemployment, the number that will lose health coverage will be crushing. As we rebuild our country’s economic base and reimagine the roles various industries play in our new future, we must also begin a difficult conversation about health care. If we’re dependent on jobs in order to have it, a lot of us will be left out in the cold. And at a time in our nation’s history where more will need quality care than ever before, the human cost will simply be too much to bear.

97424,commentisfree/2020/mar/26/virus-infection-data-coronavirus-modelling,Opinion,Can we trust the Oxford study on Covid-19 infections? | Adam Kucharski,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/virus-infection-data-coronavirus-modelling,"Earlier this month, the MSc students I teach at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ran an outbreak investigation as part of their epidemiology assessment. They were told several people had fallen ill, and it was their job to piece together various fragments of information – about symptoms, timings and locations – to work out what might have happened. We face the same challenge with every outbreak: we never have a single perfect dataset early on. Instead, we have to combine the information we do have to work out what might really be happening. This week, a preliminary study from a team at the University of Oxford gained a lot of media attention, with headlines suggesting it implied the majority of people in the UK might have already been infected with Covid-19. Few would dispute that there are more cases in the UK than already reported; our group recently published a rough analysis that suggested only 5–7% of people who’ve fallen ill with Covid-19 have been recorded as confirmed cases in the UK data. But how plausible is it that there have been millions of infections out there that were very mild (or symptomless) and went undetected? First, let’s look at what the Oxford team actually did. Its analysis focused on deaths in the UK and Italy. If we view the data in isolation, there are several scenarios that could potentially be consistent with the observed pattern of deaths. Perhaps there are lots of infections and a low severity. Or fewer infections and a higher severity. The Oxford researchers suggested there were multiple scenarios that could explain the deaths reported in the UK, including those in which there have been a huge number of infections that haven’t been detected. The media picked up on the most extreme of these scenarios, which implied the majority of the UK had already been infected. But remember, this analysis focused solely on deaths – and that’s not the only data we have for Covid-19. There are now several datasets that suggest many infections come with symptoms, particularly in older groups, and hence it is less likely that there are vast numbers of infections going undetected. Such datasets include testing on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, testing of passengers on evacuation flights, the age pattern of Covid-19 cases, and infections detected among contacts of cases. Based on these studies, it seems about 20–80% of people infected with Covid-19 could show symptoms. If this range turns out to be correct – and we combine it with our estimate that one in 15 people with symptoms are being reported – it would mean that hundreds of thousands of people in the UK have probably been infected with Covid-19 already, but not tens of millions. Of course, all these early studies have limitations in how the data was collected and what groups were being studied. To understand how much infection there has actually been, what we need are studies that collect blood samples from the wider population and test for previous exposure to Covid-19. As it happens, this was the key point made by the Oxford researchers in their paper, and it’s one I fully agree with.
There is growing evidence that, on average, people who show Covid-19 symptoms have a 1–1.5% risk of death. This has been estimated in studies of data from Wuhan, early international cases, and the Diamond Princess (with data adjusted to account for the older age of the cruise ship passengers). But this 1–1.5% risk just tells us what happens to people who have clear symptoms. If, as the above studies suggest, only 20–80% of infections come with symptoms, it would mean that for every 100,000 people who get infected with Covid-19, we would expect somewhere in the region of 200–1,200 deaths (ie between 100,000 x 20% x 1% and 100,000 x 80% x 1.5%). We still don’t know the exact risk, and we won’t until we have the results from a large-scale analysis of blood samples. But the early pieces of information we do have suggest that this is an infection that can cause a large amount of severe disease, and the majority of the UK population are still susceptible to it. Until we have evidence to the contrary, this is the scenario we have to plan for. • Adam Kucharski an epidemiologist and the author of The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop",2020-03-26 14:32:33+00:00,97425,2
97525,commentisfree/2020/mar/26/britain-covid-19-predictions,Opinion,We simply don't know what kind of Britain will awake from all this | Martin Kettle,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/britain-covid-19-predictions,"If there is one thing everyone living through the Covid-19 emergency agrees, it is that it is unprecedented. Everyone is surely right about that. But what follows in politics, economics and social behaviour from that recognition? There is no agreement there. There are resemblances with wartime, of course, but Britain never went into almost total lockdown in wartime. There are echoes of past pestilences too, but these afflictions did not bring normal life to such a totalising standstill. And these are only early days in a long process. Politicians are no better than anyone else at adjusting to radical change. As Boris Johnson’s uncertain initial messaging exemplified, adjustment takes time. The worst of the crisis is also yet to come. Covid-19 cases and deaths have not yet peaked. The outbreak may drag on for longer than we have yet grasped, or it may return. Pretending that life could be back to normal by Easter, as Donald Trump does, is delinquent. If the 1918-19 flu pandemic is a guide, the Covid-19 virus may be with us for a year.
This length and seriousness mean that none of us yet knows what the final accounting on the Covid-19 crisis will look like. But we can say that we are likely to be living with some of the pandemic’s consequences for years to come. The issues that could endure are many. They start with the shared experience of having the shadow of death hanging over our heads. They include, additionally, the impact of the massive public health emergency itself, the many transformations of everyday living, the state’s mobilisation to defend the economy, and the general anxiety about the future that is laid bare in an Ipsos-Mori survey this week. None of these is likely to be gone by Christmas, never mind by Easter. Faced with an extraordinary event, it is natural to think it will have extraordinary long-term consequences too. Nevertheless, much of the speculation about this is struggling to adjust. Its feet are still firmly planted in the past. It is largely conditioned by earlier political divisions such as Brexit. In some cases, the pandemic is merely vindicating whatever the thinker believed in the first place, before the outbreak began. All the pandemic has done is make them believe it more strongly than ever. There are three obvious problems with such an approach. The first is it assumes the pandemic will cause the scales to fall from the eyes of those who do not share it. But this may not happen. The second is that it fails to take account of how the public mood will change once the pandemic ceases. And it will. The third is that it avoids self-questioning. Both left and right are currently guilty of acting as though nothing has really changed. Those on the left who believed before Covid-19 that Britain was collapsing under the weight of social inequality, a lack of Keynesian demand management or the folly of Brexit have looked at the crisis and concluded that, yes, the pandemic proves that they were right all along. Yet those on the right who believed beforehand that the economy was more reliably run in their hands, that borders needed to be rather more tightly controlled, and that nation states must make their own decisions feel equally vindicated. In the same way, when it comes to attitudes towards individual politicians, Johnson’s admirers now admire him even more than ever, while his detractors denounce him even more indignantly. It seems obvious to his critics that Johnson is the wrong man for the crisis and equally obvious to them that he is mishandling it so badly he may be overthrown. But the opinion polls don’t say that. A lot of people elected Johnson in December and even more think he is doing a good job now.
Everyone in these debates could use a bit of humility and a dose of open-mindedness. That’s true on both sides. It’s true for all of us. The right has been forced to relearn the prime importance of the state as guarantor in a period of emergency. It is having to accept the state’s irreducible responsibility to the most vulnerable. It has also, perhaps, learned that what a health service can achieve reflects the investment that has been made in it, although no health service anywhere has been or could have been fully prepared. But the left has lessons to learn too. Many of the takeaways from the Covid-19 crisis may seem obvious. But what is true during a crisis is not necessarily true or desirable when the crisis is over. The NHS needs whatever it takes in a crisis, but at other times health service spending is as long as a piece of string and there has to be a cut-off point, if only to allow spending elsewhere. The borrowing that may or may not save the economy from recession in a crisis will also have to be paid for when the crisis is over. People may trust Johnson with powers they would not want Jeremy Corbyn to possess. We are sailing in the dark towards an unknown future. Britain’s mood after the first world war and the flu pandemic has been described by the historian Richard Overy as “the morbid age”. It was, Overy says, an era of fear and paranoia about a dystopian future. Few put their faith in traditional politics. Britain after the second was very different. “Never again” was its more optimistic motto. No one can say which of these moods, or what other mood, is likely after the Covid-19 pandemic . Instead of insisting that the pandemic confirms everything we thought beforehand, it would be better to start thinking about all the unwelcome changes that the pandemic may bring in the decade to come. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",2020-03-26 06:00:20+00:00,97526,2
97655,commentisfree/2020/mar/25/mass-covid-19-testing-is-vital-but-the-data-must-be-localised,Opinion,Mass testing is the only way to stop the virus – it's long overdue | Anthony Costello,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/mass-covid-19-testing-is-vital-but-the-data-must-be-localised,"Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the crucial importance of testing. Speed is of the essence, and three things are crucial: tracking down cases with symptoms; identifying their household cluster and tracing people they’ve contacted; and quarantining them until they are no longer infectious. Testing is the basis of public health detective work to shut down an epidemic. “You can’t fight a virus if you don’t know where it is,” said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recently. “Find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.” Physical distancing is another strategy, but it’s less effective than testing. In the early stages of an epidemic, when clusters are few and far between, one needs a huge population distancing effort to stop their spread. At that point, most people won’t grasp the scale of the threat and will resist restrictive orders. So testing, contact tracing and quarantining people with symptoms is crucial. As the epidemic becomes rampant, as in London, the policy must switch to intensive testing to protect health workers. As with other coronavirus outbreaks in Europe, the UK’s epidemic has progressed at different speeds across different regions. On Sunday, Dr KK Cheng, the director of the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research, reported that 50 local authorities had 10 or fewer reported coronavirus cases. Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all national policy, we need to devolve power to our local authorities and their public health outbreak teams. As Dr Cheng pointed out, “It isn’t rocket science. [Testing] does not even require personal protective equipment. Retired GPs, junior medical and nursing students will be delighted to contribute. Case numbers are doubling every four days. Every minute counts now.” Large-scale testing is about more than identifying and isolating cases. Information about the virus is power. Testing can help protect health workers and measure the progression of an epidemic. It can also provide evidence about regional variation and how the virus affects people of different ages and genders. Virologists can use information about cases to monitor the nature of the virus and any mutations. And data can show social and behavioural scientists whether their physical-distancing measures are working. Testing for the virus across the general population, in other words, can tell us whether our assumptions about coronavirus are correct. A new model from Prof Sunetra Gupta and a team of researchers at Oxford University, published yesterday, reaches conclusions that are very different from the Imperial College models. Crucially, the Oxford model is not peer reviewed – so we can’t be assured that its findings are correct – but Gupta suggests that “only a very small proportion of the population is at risk of hospitalisable illness” and that more than half the population have already been exposed to the virus, largely without symptoms. If this were true, we could expect a big surge of hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks, but then the epidemic would recede, probably with no second wave. But to know whether this is actually the case, we urgently need immunity tests that will show whether people have had the virus. By 10 March, the rates of reported Covid-19 virus tests were one for every 243 people in South Korea, 995 in Italy, 2,585 in the UK, and 38,695 in the USA. On 12 March, the UK government announced it would stop all community virus detection tests, and focus just on health worker protection. By 16 March, when it realised the NHS faced a potential meltdown if the epidemic went unchecked, the government reversed its policy; rather than mitigating the virus, it returned to a strategy of suppression. Public Health England is now reportedly increasing national laboratory testing capacity in Milton Keynes, but up until now the UK has still only been testing 5,000 specimens per day. In contrast, the Irish government has set up 41 mobile test centres which are processing 100,000 samples per week for a population of 4.9 million (the UK’s population is an estimated 66.4 million).
Every UK medical school and most large hospitals have labs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. These can amplify tiny genetic pieces of the virus from nasal swabs to indicate a positive test. Batches of 200 tests can be completed in a few hours. We don’t yet have commercially standardised “primers” (tools used to find the viral genetic pieces) but, with authorisation from government, labs could develop their own to provide an adequate service for now. If power is devolved to local labs, our local authority outbreak teams could rapidly escalate testing. The announcement of mass home testing in the UK is welcome. Around the world, companies are working frantically to develop diagnostic machines where people swabbing themselves can post samples to a lab. Others are using the Crispr-Cas9 genome editor to create a simple colour change on a test strip within 30 minutes. Either would be a game changer if they could be adopted at scale. People with symptoms would be able to self-isolate, identify contacts, report online to a national database, and the problem of mapping and rapidly quarantining those with coronavirus would be largely solved. Sadly, home testing won’t prevent the deluge of cases facing the NHS in the next few weeks. But if the Imperial modellers are right and the epidemic returns after we achieve suppression, local authorities, using evidence from tests, could better control outbreaks and loosen the restrictions on our economy and our lives. • Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO",2020-03-25 15:55:40+00:00,97656,2
97658,commentisfree/2020/mar/25/new-virus-china-covid-19-food-markets,Opinion,"It takes a whole world to create a new virus, not just China | Laura Spinney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/new-virus-china-covid-19-food-markets,"When I get stressed, a patch of annoying red eczema appears on the inside of my upper right arm. The doctor gives me some cream to rub on it, but I also know that to stop it coming back I have to deal with the underlying problem. Too much information, you’re thinking, but let me make the analogy. The reason we shouldn’t call the Sars-CoV-2 virus causing global misery the “Chinese virus” is the same reason I shouldn’t blame my eczema on my upper arm: there is clearly a superficial weakness there, but the real cause lies elsewhere. All the evidence gathered to date suggests that the now notorious Chinese “wet markets” – places selling live and dead animals for human consumption – provide an opportunity for coronaviruses to jump easily from animals to people. It happened with the Sars-CoV virus in 2002-3 – which was contained before it caused a pandemic – and it has happened again with its close relative, Sars-CoV-2.
But to understand why the emergence of such zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – has accelerated in recent decades, you have to understand the forces putting those viruses in our path. They are political and economic. They have to do with the rise of industrial-scale farming concerns in China and the resulting marginalisation of millions of smallholder farmers. In order to survive, those farmers have moved into the production of more exotic species – animals that were once eaten only for subsistence. But the bigger operations have pushed the farmers out geographically too, as they have taken up more prime farming land. The smallholders have been forced closer to uncultivable zones such as forests, where bats – reservoirs for coronaviruses – lurk. The stars have aligned, and not in a good way, to channel bat viruses through intermediate mammalian hosts such as pangolins, and into humans. Even so, to play devil’s advocate for a moment, the problem could still be regarded as uniquely Chinese. But there are two reasons why that’s not true. First, with the opening up of China, its agribusiness has ceased to be wholly Chinese-owned. It is a big recipient of foreign direct investment. Second, as the American pandemic expert, David Morens, and his colleagues pointed out last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, we’ve been watching a similar drama unfold over a much longer timescale with influenza – the disease that has caused more pandemics in the history of humanity than any other. Flu viruses that infect animals, including poultry and pigs, have periodically spilled over into humans ever since we domesticated those animals millennia ago. But the factory farms that produce our food today ratchet up the virulence of those flu viruses just before they spill over. This ratcheting up has been documented in Europe, Australia and the US more than it has in poor or emerging economies, and it’s what gave rise to the last flu pandemic in 2009. The first cases of that pandemic were recorded in California, but nobody calls it the American flu – and it’s right that they don’t, if only because American farms aren’t wholly American-owned either. China, for one, has invested in them. It’s not just the industries that produce our food that are creating the conditions in which new zoonoses emerge. Logging, mining, road-building and rapid urbanisation are also contributing, and the profits from those are shared internationally too. “We have created a global, human-dominated ecosystem that serves as a playground for the emergence and host-switching of animal viruses,” wrote Morens et al. The resulting diseases are suffered locally at first, as is reflected in their names – Ebola and Zika virus diseases and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, to name just three – but the irony is that some of them, such as HIV and Covid-19, go on to become global. It’s hard not to see a terrible natural justice in that. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines on how to name diseases, which stipulated that such names should not single out particular human populations, places, animals or food. Names that commit those sins often turn out to be wrong anyway, but by the time that becomes clear the damage has already been done. Gay-related immune deficiency or Grid, the first name given to Aids, stigmatised the gay community while stymying research into how the disease affected other groups. President Trump’s labelling of Sars-CoV-2 as the “Chinese virus” is also unhelpful. At a time when the main centres of Covid-19 infection are outside China, and Americans and Europeans could be learning valuable lessons from the Chinese, he is exchanging insults with Chinese politicians who have accused him of racism and hinted – just as preposterously – that the US military brought the virus to China. The slanging match suits Trump, distracting from his mishandling of the epidemic at home, but it does the rest of us no favours.
That doesn’t mean China shouldn’t be held accountable for its shortcomings. Americans know where their weak points are – they include agricultural fairs, where pigs and humans come together – and they police them ferociously. Their infectious disease experts can detect a virus circulating in a herd and generate a vaccine to it within hours. The Chinese have got better at this lately. They now vaccinate their poultry flocks against a dangerous flu virus, H7N9, which first infected humans in 2013, for example. But nearly 20 years after Sars-CoV spilled over in a wet market, those places still appear to be a liability. Controlling that animal-human interface is obviously important, but it shouldn’t blind us to the bigger problem, which is those globalised industries. Economists use the term “tragedy of the commons” to describe a shared resource – common grazing land, say – that is spoiled by individuals acting in their own self-interest. It has been applied to the climate crisis, but as University of British Columbia geographer Luke Bergmann and his colleagues have pointed out, it doesn’t quite fit what has happened here. In the case of these industries, it would be more accurate to say that they have excluded the nearly 8 billion of us who depend on the commons from participating in their governance. Yet we are bearing the costs of their industrial exploitation, in the form of pandemic disease. We have our share of responsibility, as individuals, in the foods we choose to eat and the lifestyle choices we make generally. There are a lot of us on this planet and sustaining us is costly. But as has become increasingly clear, these industries have decoupled themselves from consumer choice; they’re driving it rather than responding to it. It’s time we took back the commons, which means voting for politicians who will hold those industries accountable, rather than ones who deflect the blame. We need leaders who understand that the treatment for this particular eruption cannot only be topical, it has to be systemic too. • Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World",2020-03-25 15:31:29+00:00,97659,2
97715,commentisfree/2020/mar/25/search-coronavirus-cure-vaccine-pandemic,Opinion,Is it right to cut corners in the search for a coronavirus cure? | Julian Savulescu,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/search-coronavirus-cure-vaccine-pandemic,"The race is on to find a treatment for coronavirus. This race is split between two approaches: the trialling of pre-existing drugs used for similar diseases, and the hunt for a vaccine. In both instances, important ethical decisions must be made. Is it OK to reassign a treatment that comes with side-effects? And with thousands dying from coronavirus every day, is it acceptable to cut corners in the search for a vaccine?
Last Friday, the World Health Organization announced the launch of Solidarity, a worldwide trial of the four most promising candidate treatments for Covid-19: remdesivir, an antiretroviral treatment for Ebola; chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, both antimalarials; ritonavir, an HIV treatment; and interferon, a treatment for hepatitis C. Both Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle and China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences last week announced the start of human trials for new possible vaccines. Around 30 other research groups worldwide are working on vaccines. But the WHO estimates that a vaccine won’t be ready until June 2021. There are requirements that have to be observed. The gold standard for this kind of research is the clinical trial – administering the vaccine to a large number of people in controlled conditions and measuring its effect. Usually scientists wait 14 months to monitor effectiveness and possible side-effects – which is why we may have to wait until next summer. Coronavirus vaccine trials face the following dilemma: we need treatment quickly but we also need to know it will work. The worst outcome for the medical industry would be a vaccine that either did not work or, worse, was harmful or had side-effects. Globally, faith in vaccines is already at an all-time low. Decisions are taken by governments, in tandem with ethics committees. Every day they delay the development or introduction of an intervention found to be effective, a growing number will die. There have so far been 19,603 deaths, with 12% of those deaths occurring in a single day – yesterday (Tuesday 24 March). The economic devastation being wrought must also be considered – this will cost lives through depression, suicide and other effects of deprivation. In a pandemic, time is not only money. It is lives. Many lives. Yet even promising possible treatments can prove to be ineffective or even harmful. Remdesivir, chloroquine, ritonavir and interferon all have serious side-effects, including heart arrhythmias and possibly death. Indeed, a man in Arizona died after ingesting chloroquine, believing it would protect him from Covid-19. In terms of vaccine discovery, there are plenty of ways authorities could speed up the process. One is a human challenge study. This involves deliberately infecting a person with coronavirus to look at how the virus behaves and using that evidence to find the most promising vaccines. Today, healthy people are deliberately infected with flu, common cold, typhoid, malaria, dengue fever and streptococcal infections to study the disease, and more rapidly develop vaccines and treatments. Challenge studies have been proposed in Covid-19. Hvivo, a clinical research group in London, has attracted more than 20,000 volunteers willing to be infected with a milder coronavirus that does not cause serious symptoms. They will each be paid £3,500. However, the utility of studying a related virus may be limited. There have been suggestions of challenge studies infecting younger participants at lower risk of complication with Covid-19. This comes with dangers and profound ethical implications – but could save thousands of lives. Another alternative would be to conscript low-risk people likely to be exposed to Covid-19 anyway to vaccine trials. A benefit of this would be to accrue a large sample group, so helping to indicate whether treatments could be rolled out to large populations. It is notable that China’s vaccine testing will occur within a military installation: the suggestion is that trials may be conducted on soldiers without consent. This war will require lines to be drawn: what level of uncertainty to accept, whether research can be done on unconscious patients without consent, what level of risk is justifiable, and so on. Currently these decisions are usually made by ethics committees using guidelines developed for non-pandemic situations. We require leadership from the government to push ahead scientific research around all treatment options, while ensuring reasonable risks. In my opinion, a failure by government to support this research is as wrong as implementing harmful policy. How quickly we develop a treatment or a cure will depend on the risks we are prepared to take. So far, western countries have given greater priority to liberty and rights than eastern countries in responding to coronavirus, leaving them less able to secure public health. It is now, most likely, too late to eliminate the virus with isolation and quarantine. Scientific research looks the most promising option for a resolution to this pandemic. We need to run the race by the rules in order to sufficiently protect human participants. But there is a balance to be struck: let’s not run it with one hand tied behind our back. • Julian Savulescu is chair of the Oxford Uehiro centre for practical ethics and director of the Oxford Martin programme on collective responsibility for infectious disease at the University of Oxford",2020-03-25 11:01:49+00:00,97716,2
97717,commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings,Opinion,The UK's coronavirus policy may sound scientific. It isn't | Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Yaneer Bar-Yam,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings,"When, along with applied systems scientist Dr Joe Norman, we first reacted to coronavirus on 25 January with the publication of an academic note urging caution, the virus had reportedly infected fewer than 2,000 people worldwide and fewer than 60 people were dead. That number need not have been so high. At the time of writing, the numbers are 351,000 and 15,000 respectively. Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way. We called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: constrain mobility. Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen. The error in the UK is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking. First, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we should make happen, and how. The modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management – like wisdom – requires robustness in models. But if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will. This was the case with the disastrous “herd immunity” thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the “just do nothing” approach. Individuals and scientists around the world immediately pointed out the obvious flaws: there’s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren’t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many young people have severe cases of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride. This doesn’t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of reccurrence of the disease. Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus. Worse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a shortage of hospital beds. Second, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with “scientism” – things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the nudge group that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university – yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a “replication crisis”, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world.
So what is called “evidence-based” methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings’s love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a segment of the population die for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy – aside from the moral repugnance of the idea. As we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing. The obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and South Korea rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat. • Nassim Nicholas Taleb is distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering and author of The Black Swan.

Each day I’d go to work and either operate on patients with prostate cancer, see patients with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer to discuss surgery, or check in with patients after I’d operated on them to monitor their recovery. Now, my working days are chaotic and unpredictable. Some hospitals are already overloaded with coronavirus admissions. Others, like University College London Hospitals, where I work, are busy making space for the impending outbreak. At UCLH, cancellations of elective cases have given doctors more time to help Covid-19 patients. Anaesthetists have tried to hold off using respirators for these patients until absolutely necessary, preferring less invasive methods instead. This has used fewer resources and freed up anaesthetists and intensive care nurses who would otherwise be managing incubated patients. Our strategy appears to be working, at least for now. What is less clear is how we will prevent death and disability from other non-viral conditions during the outbreak. Though some would be forgiven for assuming coronavirus is now the only disease, the NHS still has to deal with myriad other illnesses alongside the pandemic. What will happen to patients with cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other medical conditions that still need managing? For these patients, the knock-on effects of coronavirus could be devastating. A patient with end-stage cancer, who needs chemotherapy that could extend their life by a few months, may no longer get this treatment – as the chemotherapy could make them more susceptible to coronavirus. Oncologists have informed me that the decisions facing their patients amount to Hobson’s choice – without chemotherapy, patients will likely die more quickly from their cancer, but they will still be less likely to die than if they contracted coronavirus while undergoing chemotherapy. And what about the cancer patients with better prospects - those who could have an operation and be “cured”? In the current viral climate, these patients are now deemed not “time critical” enough to warrant their operations. They may remain stuck in a “holding pattern”, rather like flights not yet cleared for landing. They risk their cancers progressing – possibly even to an incurable state. And while these risks may be low, it’s a lottery no patient wants to play.
When this is all over, when the NHS has defeated this virus, when children are back to school, shops are reopened and cities are no longer under lockdown, what will happen to the countless people who are still waiting for treatment? How does a previously overstretched NHS cope with managing these patients, in addition to those who will present with cancer and other non-viral illnesses during the coronavirus outbreak? The NHS will face one of the steepest backlogs of cases in its history. To stem this backlog and ensure patients get the treatment they need, we should consider redistributing current resources to create hubs where oncologists and cancer surgeons could treat their urgent patients. Rather than basing the clinical priority of these patients on NHS waiting targets, as has historically been the case, these doctors could instead triage patients according to the severity and risks of their disease. Though much of our focus now is rightly on coronavirus deaths, we risk losing sight of another wave of tragic fatalities – those who didn’t have coronavirus, but didn’t get the treatment they needed during this urgent crisis. • Prasanna Sooriakumaran is a consultant urological surgeon at University College London Hospital",2020-03-25 07:00:52+00:00,97754,2

In the rich nations, we have begun to believe we have transcended the material world. The wealth we’ve accumulated – often at the expense of others – has shielded us from reality. Living behind screens, passing between capsules – our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls – we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards. Now the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished storms through our lives. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long. The planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it’s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them. A large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being hammered by drought, floods, fire and locusts (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of anomalous tropical cyclones). When we call such hazards “biblical”, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us. In his forthcoming book, Our Final Warning, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become too high for humans to tolerate, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to exceed the lethal thresholds for crop plants across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into dust bowls. Simultaneous global harvest failure – something that has never happened in the modern world – becomes highly likely. In combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and pollinators, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps its promises under the Paris agreement, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C. Thanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don’t need to change. When I challenge them, I’m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven’t experienced since I opposed the Iraq war. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like lab-grown food, is scarcely anywhere. But this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on many livestock farms. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to deliver bacterial resistance. In the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with veterinary antibiotics, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the search for new drugs. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers. Our multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the Bath Half Marathon, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. “It is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.” In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts – the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths – it might cause. The amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments – but at least they got there in the end. Sunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life. There are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who claims that the coronavirus is nothing more than “a little flu”. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him. Or this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life. This coronavirus reminds us that we belong to the material world. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",2020-03-25 06:00:51+00:00,97771,2
97792,commentisfree/2020/mar/25/the-australian-welfare-system-has-always-been-needlessly-cruel-now-its-punishing-half-the-country,Opinion,The Australian welfare system has always been needlessly cruel. Now it’s punishing half the country | Tom Hawking,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/the-australian-welfare-system-has-always-been-needlessly-cruel-now-its-punishing-half-the-country,"Like a lot of people, I called Centrelink on Monday. After 11 attempts to get through, I was greeted with a message directing me to the MyGov website. Navigating that site eventually revealed that to register, I’d need a customer reference number, which could only be obtained … by phone. Welcome to the 12 Tasks of Centrelink. Judging by the lengthy message imploring callers not to abuse staff to which you’re forced to listen before you’re admitted into the oubliette that is Centrelink’s phone queue at the moment, there are a lot of people out there who are angry and bewildered at the current situation. This, of course, is hardly surprising: the unprecedented economic effects of coronavirus mean there are a lot of people turning to the government to help for the first time, and they’re clearly not impressed by the system they’re being required to navigate. Anyone more used to dealing with that system, however, will find the maddeningly circular experience of trying to get any sense out of Centrelink all too familiar … which, of course, is the whole point.
Over the last 30 years or so, successive governments have done their best to one-up each other in making benefits ever more difficult to access. Every passing year seems to bring a new requirement: the diaries that need to be filled out to “prove” you’re looking for work, with their implication that those claiming benefits are liars; the demerit point system, whereby applicants are punished unilaterally and without right of appeal – and, in many cases, unfairly – at the discretion of a private service provider; the “mutual obligation” system with its ever-moving goalposts, questionable courses and pointless make-work. How did we come to this? Like many other systems, the Australian welfare system has its roots in the post-war consensus and welfare state, and the understanding that the provision of state support is preferable to a situation where loss of employment can result in homelessness and destitution. And as in many other countries, as that consensus has crumbled under 40 years of free-market rhetoric and neoliberal economic policy, the support system has slowly devolved from a well-intentioned safety net into an ever-constricting noose.
Under the particular combination of social and economic conservatism that took hold in Australia during the John Howard years (and in many other western democracies over the period that basically began with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan), a need for state assistance is treated less as an economic crisis than it is as a moral failure on the claimant’s part. For decades now, the unemployed have been among the favourite political punching bags of politicians and ideologues alike, perhaps because the very existence of both these groups seems to undermine the promise of free-market rhetoric: those who advocate for unrestrained capitalism do so on the basis that the market will inevitably elevate and enrich those who work hard enough. Those who remain poor and/or unemployed, therefore, must, by definition, not be trying hard enough. Thus is born the mythology of the dole bludger: the idler who refuses to work, and in doing so, “steals” the tax dollars of those who do work hard and thus pay to subsidise his/her laziness. The simple act of asking for help is rendered in criminal terms (and, not coincidentally, in a manner strikingly similar to how asking for refuge is portrayed). With this in mind, it’s perhaps no surprise that work-for-the-dole programs quite literally treat the unemployed in the same way as criminals. And in the same way that harsher prison sentences do little to reduce crime, the irony of punitive welfare programs is that, far from “encouraging” people back into work, they instead have the effect of locking people into the welfare system. The government has hastened to make it clear that those seeking Covid-19-related help will be spared some of the worst depredations of the system. But what makes those who lost their jobs during a pandemic any more trustworthy than those who lost their job for any other reason? Why are the former spared the indignity of being treated as scrounging chancers? As with many of the other “necessary” social indignities that have been magically “set aside” for Covid-19, the fact these measures can be so easily discarded only goes to show how unnecessary they were in the first place. If anything positive comes of the Covid-19 crisis, it’ll be to remind Australians that any of us can fall through the cracks and end up as the person who needs help. Perhaps those who have never dealt with Centrelink before will have more empathy for those who have to deal with it on a regular basis, and come to understand that unemployment is not a choice or a way of life, it’s a state that can befall any of us, and one that the vast majority of people want to escape as soon as possible.
In the meantime, faced with a PR disaster, the government is now presented with the challenge of wringing efficiency and helpfulness out of a system designed to provide neither. It’s hard not to take a degree of pleasure out of watching them flail about trying to do so, but it’s also maddening to compare the standards to which the unemployed are held, and the ineptitude with which governments get away: welfare recipients are punished for going to the doctor instead of attending an appointment, and yet Stuart Robert escapes with a casual “my bad” for his complete failure to prepare for the single greatest challenge in living memory to face his department. We’re told constantly the unemployed are a drain on society, that we “can’t afford” to increase welfare payments, that we’re “owed” huge sums by fraudulent claimants, and so on. This week has shown what we already knew: that this needlessly cruel system – with its artificial scarcity, its hoarding of resources by the privileged few, and its ceaseless demonisation of those left out – is not a natural state of being. It is imposed on us, and that imposition can be suspended in an emergency. The only question, then, is what constitutes an emergency: who matters, who is important and who needs to be at risk for the referee to step in and the ghastly game to be stopped. In 2016 film-maker Ken Loach described the UK’s benefits system as “a Kafka-esque, Catch-22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary”. His words could just as easily apply to the Australian system, which is also designed to be punitive and humiliating. Right now, it’s punishing and humiliating half the country. • Tom Hawking is a freelance writer based in Melbourne",2020-03-25 01:43:36+00:00,97793,2

His reluctance to wage an effective campaign left the nation dangerously exposed to the deadly threat coronavirus posed. The prime minister had given the impression that this episode was a test of Darwinian fitness for the public and it would be possible to get through it without any upheaval to the post-election order. That was a substantial error of both judgment and ideology, the scale of which was laid bare by the government’s own analysis that an unmitigated epidemic could lead to 510,000 deaths. Panic gripped and enlarged Leviathan, the sovereign power meant to protect us from one another. Harried by the bond markets, seeing parts of the economy approaching collapse and with the Covid-19 death toll creeping upwards, Mr Johnson’s government first created £200bn to stave off a run on its bonds, then nationalised the railways and finally ordered the population to stay behind locked doors. During the crisis, Mr Johnson has been forced to implement measures – such as limiting movement and policing quarantines – that infringe on liberties to preserve life. Covid-19 has already disrupted economic, social and spiritual life. Individuals will submit to restrictions. But that consent is conditional on sacrifices being equally shared. It’s no good expanding the state to save businesses but not people. That is why Labour is right to push the government to produce a support package for the self-employed and to get protective equipment to medics. While the prime minister looked all at sea, his opponents within and without the Conservative party have been admirably clear about the gravity of the situation. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, is beginning to establish himself as a prophet who had been right all along. He has been ahead of the curve with his warnings about the scale of the crisis. This is not something to cavil at, even when there is a general agreement over the need for national purpose. In our democracy, government is accountable to parliament, and politicians’ reputations are built by their arguments being vindicated by events. Mr Hunt, who lost to Mr Johnson to lead the Tory party, highlighted how South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have all experienced low death tolls through mass testing and tracking. While reporting enables scientists to predict a disease’s trajectory, allows researchers to develop treatments and vaccines, and helps doctors to trace transmission, such a regime raises concerns about the reach of government. Tracking populations to fight the disease now may open the doors to more invasive forms of government eavesdropping later. One group of technologists, civil liberty groups and academics has warned that “the combination of the [new emergency coronavirus] bill with existing far-reaching data-gathering powers creates the risk that location and contact-tracking technology could be used as a means of social control”. What is needed, they say, is for any initiatives being considered by ministers to “protect human rights, be proportionate and work within the rule of law – not least because they will set the template for what comes next in the delivery of health services in the UK”. Such a call ought to be heeded, especially in light of the prime minister’s own dim view of such protections. The habits of mind that need to be cultivated by government to succeed with this approach are transparency and trust, neither of which come easily to Mr Johnson’s team, who sometimes view criticism as unpatriotic. What is required is a high level of candour and accountability. Mr Johnson has to act decisively. He will probably adopt policies to combat the pandemic so intrusive and big they would be considered bizarre in normal times. But these are not normal times. In the longer term his expanded state must be a supportive – rather than corrosive – one.",2020-03-24 19:36:34+00:00,97830,67

The idea of a Sino-American G2, reaching bilateral consensus on key issues to prudently steer the international community, always sounded like a fairytale. But from this moment in time, it seems more like a bad joke. As a pandemic threatens millions of lives, and further suffering through a global recession, the shortcomings of China and the US are increasingly glaring. Chinese authorities covered up the Wuhan outbreak and harassed those who tried to blow the whistle, allowing the coronavirus to spread within and then beyond its borders – though subsequent draconian measures appear to have contained the internal spread, for now at least, and should have bought time for other countries to prepare. Chinese diplomats and state media promoted wild conspiracy theories suggesting the virus originated, or was even created, in the US, even if officials may now be drawing back. Last week, with everyone’s attention on the pandemic, Beijing threw out US journalists from major news organisations in belated retaliation for tightened controls on Chinese state media companies in the US. Meanwhile, Donald Trump spent weeks dismissing concerns and suggested the virus would “disappear” and was “very well under control”. He ceded responsibility to states and now wants to return to business as usual, as if that were possible – even as the World Health Organization warns that America could become the new centre of the pandemic. Medical experts and governors are in despair. He tried to lure a German firm developing a possible vaccine to the US. He promoted an unproven treatment. With gratuitous cruelty, his administration has tightened sanctions on Iran, one of the worst-hit countries. He has, until this week, insisted on referring to “the Chinese virus” despite the resulting stigma and hate crime. Mr Trump may yet regret his finger-pointing; many materials needed for equipment such as masks are mainly produced in China. Pundits have blamed predatory pricing by Chinese firms for ending penicillin and aspirin production in the US, but the US has also showed complacency in failing to protect key national resources and relying on foreign production. Washington’s failures are allowing Beijing, despite its own culpability, to restore its image and build foreign influence. “The only country that can help us is China … European solidarity does not exist,” declared the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, last week; masks and health experts arrived days later. China’s dispatches of medical supplies to other countries are welcome; so presumably were the shipments it received from the EU when the outbreak emerged, and the equipment that European neighbours have shared with each other. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned on Tuesday of a “struggle for influence”, including through the “politics of generosity”. The bloc must show that solidarity is not an empty phrase, he wrote. The pandemic has underscored the need for international cooperation. When problems are global, solutions must be too. But it has also shown once more that China and the US are neither fit to lead, nor interested in cooperation, and that the rest of the world will need to find its own ways of working together.",2020-03-24 19:35:07+00:00,97832,2

A pandemic and the steps taken to contain it force a dizzying adjustment of perspective. With one twist of the lens, events that once loomed large are made remote – dots on the horizon in a bygone era.
In the parallel universe where there is no Covid-19, British politics is gearing up for local and mayoral elections; a second round of Brexit trade negotiations began this week, and Labour leadership contenders are out on the stump. Yet instead we are in a place where elections are suspended along with nearly every other outdoor expression of political freedom. Democracy is confined to quarters, as is necessary to prevent transmission of the virus. We know that lockdown can save lives. We do not yet know which muscles of civil society will atrophy from lack of exercise. The coronavirus bill, rushed through parliament this week, is a totalitarian beast on a constitutional leash, held by MPs whose grip is unproven. The government had sought extreme powers for a year but acquiesced to cross-party demands for a six-month expiry date, with an option to renew. Meanwhile, ministers can shut businesses, disperse crowds, detain citizens. Police can treat the nation as if it were under house arrest. Those are the headline cuts in liberty but the law’s finer print tells a chilling story of cultural changes yet to be imposed by Covid-19. The bill gives local authorities power to requisition facilities for storing and disposing of dead bodies. It eases rules designed to prevent wrongful detention on grounds of mental ill health. Such measures can be justified for the greater good, as efficient marshalling of limited resources. But every compromise on due process scatters seeds of negligence in shaded corners of the state, where cruelties and injustice can grow. The gravity of the moment was not lost on the depleted ranks of MPs who debated the bill. None of them had confronted an equivalent challenge: to suppress public activity without wanton violence to democracy. The respectful tone of debate would be unfamiliar to anyone who only tunes into parliament for its rowdiest fixtures. Even the participants found the mood unusual, prefacing speeches with generosity for old enemies – Scottish nationalists praising former Tory cabinet ministers who praised Labour front benchers. The comparison is naturally made with wartime solidarity, although the likeness is inexact. A military foe does not hijack banal social relations as insidiously as viral transmission. And there is not much collective memory of what it really means for individuals to submerge selfish needs in an enterprise of collective duty. Too many people became accomplices to the virus by ignoring government advice. Voluntary submission was not working. Andrew Bowie, Tory party vice chair, said over the weekend: “This is not a game.” It should not have needed saying, except it did because games are what politics has seemed to be all about in recent years. People can be forgiven if they were slow to take a threat seriously when Westminster culture has so often projected frivolity. The prime minister has built a career from raffish disobedience, seeing diligence as the mark of a “girly swot”. Boris Johnson was not elected to be the nation’s head prefect, and has struggled to adapt to the role. Only in his address to the nation on Monday night, declaring mass lockdown, did he find the right pitch – assertive simplicity. He stripped away the rhetorical ornamentation that usually laces his phrases with playful insincerity. He finally achieved gravitas without it sounding like a pastiche of statesmanship. He wisely eschewed any references to the Blitz spirit or other pseudo-Churchillian vibes, perhaps recognising that he has devalued that currency with over-use in less deserving circumstances. The prime minister’s supporters say he has been reluctant to impose social controls that grate against his liberal instinct. There is some truth in that defence, although it flatters the man to prop up his wobbly indecision with a sturdy-sounding philosophy. Johnson likes freedom, but above all for himself. His creed that is now said to be anti-authoritarian is just the stuff of old Daily Telegraph polemics against pettifogging bureaucracy. Its ethical core is hardly more developed than the loathing for ’elf-and-safety that tickled many a Tory conference fringe meeting. There is a continuum between the Johnson who once described the obligation to put children in car booster seats for their own safety as “utterly demented”, and the man who resisted closing pubs in a public health emergencybut it is not a connection that casts the prime minister in the best light. Johnson likes to be liked, so he tells people what they want to hear. He is a master of politics that makes no moral demands of citizens. He offers freedoms unburdened with responsibility. He brilliantly swept away doubts about Brexit, belittling the hazard as a figment of timid imaginations. He has sauntered through a charmed life believing that risks are mitigated by declaring them exaggerated. Coronavirus does not respond to that treatment. It might be the first adversary Johnson has met that cannot be outmanoeuvred with political chicanery. It is revealing how a politician who has always talked his way out of trouble took so long to find his voice in this crisis. He is used to people rallying to his charisma, but the precedent was misleading. His method has been to offer treats without naming a price. A different political quality is needed to persuade people to make sacrifices. The gap between official advice on social distancing and its being followed had to be bridged with moral authority, which was hard to summon for a prime minister who has always invited his audience to be complicit in his complacency. Thousands of lives were put at risk because Downing Street was slow to grasp the magnitude of the threat and hesitant with remedies. The most generous account of the delay suggests that Britain was blessed with a prime minister who did not itch to grab dictatorial powers. There is some reassurance there, although we cannot yet say what the effect of those powers might be on ministers who get into the habit of wielding them.
We must entrust our civil rights to parliament but also to some supposedly liberal substance coursing through the prime minister’s veins. That would be easier if he did not come to the job with a record of recklessness and indifference to the cost his gambles force on other people. Only when confronted with a crisis that cannot be played for laughs has Johnson understood that politics is not a game. And he was persuaded by nothing nobler than the feeling that his old way wasn’t winning any more. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",2020-03-24 16:06:06+00:00,97884,2
97894,commentisfree/2020/mar/24/social-distancing-government-covid-19,Opinion,Don't just blame the  public over social distancing. Look to the government | Frances Ryan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/social-distancing-government-covid-19,"Backed into a corner, Boris Johnson has announced an unprecedented lockdown on Britain’s public life. The solemn tone of last night’s address carried the heavy weight of reluctance. For days, the government’s messaging has been that the public were failing to practice social distancing of their own accord, with sources saying there was “total fury” across Westminster over people flouting orders and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accusing those still gathering of being “very selfish”.
You don’t have to be too cynical to feel that this language sounds a lot like the government preparing to play its get out of jail card, whereby it offers vague and unenforceable “advice”, points disapprovingly to those ignoring it, and is then free to shift blame for the inevitable rise in coronavirus cases on to the public. From the beginning, the government’s communications strategy has bordered on lethal complacency. It told the public its plan was “herd immunity”, which required many to catch the virus, only to backtrack as if it had never said it. Johnson only closed pubs and restaurants at the weekend, having previously offered social distancing guidance that never cut through. Until Tuesday’s address, ministers have used paywalled articles and a 5pm briefing to get information across, rather than the blanket national TV ads and billboards you would expect. It has even emerged that the government can’t send advice on coronavirus directly to Britons’ mobile phones because it repeatedly ignored its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help in times of crisis. Instead, it had to rely on mobile network operators. The result has been all too predictable. People in the UK have flocked to seaside towns and beauty spots in recent days as many families appeared to view schools closing as an opportunity for an early Easter holiday. Parks were filled with groups of friends obliviously meeting up in the sunshine. New data confirms the UK has been lagging behind other countries in measures such as cutting down our restaurant visits and working at home. The social distancing shambles has led to some uncomfortable “punching down”, such as high-profile online accounts mocking people for queuing at supermarkets. But a focus on blaming the public risks letting the government – the party with power, resources and reach – off the hook. There is a middle ground, however. It is possible to think adults have a personal responsibility to consider their high-risk neighbours while believing the government has heavily influenced their failure to do so by poor communication and slow action. The theme of personal responsibility often becomes toxic when used politically – whether it’s claiming that “the poor wouldn’t need food banks if only they budgeted properly”, or “the long-term sick would get off benefits if they had enough motivation”. But you don’t have to be a libertarian to understand that individual behaviour is key in a pandemic, or to believe that we have a duty to think of each other. While political structures strongly determine our choices, free will still means we hold some responsibility for them. To put it another way: leisure venues being open for so long in the UK was a psychological nudge that gave many people “permission” to still use them – but it was still up to each of us if we chose a fun outing with mates over listening to calls to protect someone else’s life. An 18-year-old with underlying health problems died this weekend. I wonder how many nights out at the pub they’ll miss out on. Public behaviour in the light of Johnson’s hands-off approach could be compared to smoking, in that smokers were well aware of the risk of cancer but it took legislative action to discourage many of them. But it’s actually more like passive smoking: continuing to socialise in the face of coronavirus, and the state refusing to strongly step in, didn’t just endanger individuals themselves, but other people at higher risk. Perhaps instead of photos of damaged lungs on fag packets, the government should be running ads of grandmas in ICU gasping for air. If this is hard to hear, it should be. People are dying. People are trapped inside their homes afraid. Others have enjoyed a day trip to the beach. For years, Britain’s political culture has stoked a dog-eat-dog individualism, just as it has cast doubt on experts. We should not be shocked that those particular chickens are now coming home to roost. The government is finally introducing the state-led intervention this pandemic requires. But in the coming weeks values, as well as the law, are going to be what helps us get through this. A recognition that we are all more interconnected than appeared to be case. That individual want doesn’t trump community need. That disabled and older people’s lives are worth protecting. Some things should not need legislation. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People",2020-03-24 15:00:57+00:00,97895,67
97968,commentisfree/2020/mar/24/vulnerable-coronavirus-care-workers-forced-risk,Opinion,"As coronavirus hits, Britain's 'vulnerable' are terrified to see our rights removed | Jamie Hale",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/vulnerable-coronavirus-care-workers-forced-risk,"Before Covid-19, both the NHS and social care were already in crisis. Overstretched and underfunded, hospitals were overwhelmed by winter flu and a backlog of people needing community care were waiting for pitifully limited provisions. Now the country faces a new crisis, these cracks have widened even further and people like me are already beginning to fall through them. I am one of the 1.5 million people who were asked on Sunday by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to self-isolate for 12 weeks. Already more than aware of my “vulnerable” status, I have been observing self-isolation diligently. I realise coronavirus could leave me seriously ill, increasing the burden on a stretched NHS, so I am obeying those restrictions. But the amount I can do is limited when I’m wholly reliant on support from health and social care systems to remain out of hospital. I have 24-hour care, seven days a week, and am dependent on care workers for everything from repositioning me in bed and managing my stoma, my feeding pump and my non-invasive ventilation machine, to all other aspects of my personal care. I arrange and manage my own care through the government system of “direct payments” – a scheme that devolves to me all choices over employment responsibilities and care management. I choose and hire my own care workers and am independent and self-managing. To date, this has been incredibly liberating, but so far, in pandemic times, I have been left feeling stranded, with no access to a trained bank of cover staff, or even personal protective equipment – such as gloves, masks and hand sanitiser. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, yesterday announced that “hubs” would be set up across the country to deliver food and medicine to people in my position. He said: “Nobody needs to worry about getting the … essential items that they will need.” However, I’m sceptical. The omens so far aren’t good. I’ve had to buy clean clothes for employees to wear around the house to protect me from outside germs. I’ve had to make masks for them out of old T-shirts. I’ve started to wash and reuse disposable vinyl gloves. At one point I tried to make my own hand sanitiser following a recipe I found online, before realising I did not have the requisite rubbing alcohol. If I can’t protect myself from my eight-plus employees moving in and out of the house all day, my chances of avoiding coronavirus are low. Talking to other disabled people, I know we are in the same situation – unable to safely cope without this equipment, but fearful we will be left without access to it. The other problem Jenrick’s announcement does not address is that, in many cases, people are banned from using self-employed care workers, hiring friends and family, changing wage rates, or spending on recruitment if everyone falls ill at once. We may also be forbidden from altering our care plans. With my carers’ agreement, I would much rather they worked 24- or 48-hour shifts to minimise the number of people coming in and out of the house and, with it, my level of exposure. Whether I’d be permitted to use my budget in this way would need to be agreed by my funding body – and these agreements take time. Time during which I will be left at increased risk. Meanwhile, contingencies are limited. For disabled people who use agency care, theoretically the agencies are responsible for also arranging cover. Failing this, I try my bank workers, but if they can’t work, I’m stuck. I am not funded to cover sick pay, and don’t yet know how the government announcements will impact on my employees. As it stands I know they might be forced to choose between coming to work ill and risking my life, or being left without income and unable to pay their rent. This is exploitative, unfair and creates a dangerous problem for everyone involved. Direct payments leave me with the responsibility of covering my own shifts – but these are different times.
Typically the local authority would be the provider of last resort, but with the introduction yesterday of the coronavirus bill, ministers can now suspend the key duties set out in the Care Act. Local authorities will not be obliged to provide care beyond that which protects human rights. Eligible needs do not have to be met – and, in theory, councils could cease provision of almost all social care. This would result in deaths. Disabled people are terrified that if our own care arrangements fall through, there will be no safety net to catch us. This rolling back of our rights is unprecedented, and how it will look in practice is uncertain. It seems clear, though, that the results of this change could be incredibly destructive: setting a precedent by rolling back the right to live independently and, in the worst case scenario, taking us back to the days of institutional living. To top this off, if we contract coronavirus and get sick, disabled people will not be able to rely on the NHS valuing our survival equal to that of others. Doctors will be forced to make assumptions about our likelihood of survival, or our quality of life. In Italy, reports suggest that people over a certain age, and people who have pre-existing conditions have been deprioritised, out of a desperate utilitarian need for ventilators and ICU treatment to be given to those deemed “most likely” to survive. This also seems likely here in the UK, after the new Nice guidelines on dealing with Covid-19 patients appeared to deprioritise anyone dependent on others for help in activities of daily living. These decisions are obviously terrifying but we’re also afraid of what’s currently occurring: a series of small decisions leading to the removal of measures that protect our safety. We don’t need to wait for ICUs to be full before decisions are taken about our right to life – those decisions are already being made. • Jamie Hale is a disabled poet and essayist",2020-03-24 09:00:28+00:00,97969,2
98064,commentisfree/2020/mar/23/the-guardian-view-on-lockdown-for-britain-true-leadership-is-required,Opinion,The Guardian view on lockdown for Britain: necessary hardship | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/the-guardian-view-on-lockdown-for-britain-true-leadership-is-required,"After the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was introduced in 1939, imposing a series of stringent and intrusive restrictions on individual freedoms, the wartime government anxiously kept a close eye on compliance. How would people respond? The answer, a Ministry of Information report concluded in 1942, was that: “People are willing to bear any sacrifice if a 100% effort can be reached and the burden fairly shared by all.” During the critical days to come, in the very different Britain of 2020, the present government must trust in exactly the same kind of popular resilience. The public desperately needed clear leadership, as the trajectory of the coronavirus epidemic in this country continues to track that of stricken Italy. On Saturday 793 people there died from the disease in one day – a global record. It was imperative that Boris Johnson abandoned the register of exhortation and issued clear instructions that will be enforced, thereby instituting a lockdown. A laissez-faire approach to fighting a pandemic did not work. Most people, in uniquely testing circumstances, have done their best to follow the government’s guidance. A majority have broadly followed physical distancing advice, stayed at home for the most part and worked from there if possible. But the exact parameters of the permissible have remained unclear. The throngs who gathered in sunny public parks on Mother’s Day weekend were in part a testament to confused messaging about going outdoors. Sadly, there was also evidence of a willingness to disregard warnings that came with no sanction attached. Soon it will seem inconceivable that, as Belfast doctors and nurses put together a video pleading with people to stay at home, over 6,000 people gathered to run the Bath half-marathon. All gatherings of more than two people from different households will now be dispersed. The halfway house of self-regulation has now, rightly, been vacated. An analysis by scientists from University College London and the University of Cambridge found that sticking to a voluntary regime could lead to between 35,000 and 70,000 excess deaths over the next year. That is clearly an unacceptably high price to pay for allowing people to choose whether or not to do the right thing. Yet again, as in previous phases of this crisis, institutions in civil society had in any case begun to perform the necessary gear change without waiting for belated orders. The National Trust has shut parks and gardens across the country. Councils such as Lambeth have closed children’s play areas. There appears to be a grim acceptance that the previously unthinkable – the shutting down of sport, pubs and restaurants and the abandonment of the workplace – was only the beginning of what had to be thought. This new phase of the crisis will impose a level of constraint that none of us have ever experienced before. Plans must be put in place to help families with limited domestic resources to draw upon. It will be necessary to tend to people’s mental health as well as their physical wellbeing. This is a journey without maps. But the evidence from Italy suggests that citizens are willing to cede their liberties and swap freedom for greater security once the state takes responsibility. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, locked his citizens down two weeks ago. There, as in Britain, the spread of Covid-19 was initially greeted with misplaced stoicism and declarations that life must go on. The leader of the governing Democratic party, Nicola Zingaretti, was photographed sharing an aperitif with students in Milan. That kind of breezy defiance was swiftly replaced by fear, as images of overwhelmed hospitals came to dominate the evening news. Enforced by fines for those who left their homes without good reason, lockdown brought clarity and, overwhelmingly, compliance. On Sunday, Italian health officials cautiously welcomed the news that, after the horrific high of the day before, the daily toll had finally fallen back and rates of infection had slowed. On Monday both rates fell again. These are the first positive signs after a fortnight of national sacrifice. As things stand, Britain is believed to be two weeks behind Italy in this nightmarish experience. Yet the government has waited to impose a similar level of self-restraint. It is right to take this action now.",2020-03-23 19:24:07+00:00,98065,2
98149,commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered,Opinion,"Britain had a head start on Covid-19, but our leaders squandered it | Devi Sridhar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered,"Those of us who have been tracking the novel coronavirus since December can easily identify its key milestones. There was mid-January, when human to human transmission of coronavirus was confirmed. Then later that month Hubei province hit 500 cases, the unprecedented lockdown extended to almost 60 million people, and the Lancet published a study showing that a third of patients require admission to intensive care, and 29% get so bad that they need ventilation. By the end of February, a sobering WHO-China joint mission press conference illustrated the massive policy response in China – and, on 29 February, the UK saw its first case of local transmission.
In the UK we have had nine weeks to listen, learn and prepare. We have had nine weeks to run outbreak simulations, set up supply chains to ensure sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and bring about the availability of rapid, cheap tests. We have had nine weeks to establish algorithms to support contact tracing, and start mass awareness campaigns not only about hand-washing, but about the risks that the virus would pose to social and economic activity if not taken seriously by all. Countries such as Senegal were doing this in January. The UK’s head start in managing the outbreak continued as our confirmed case count remained lower than our neighbours’. However, on 12 March, Boris Johnson announced that all minor testing and contact tracing would stop and passive self-isolation would be introduced for those with symptoms, all part of a herd immunity strategy supposedly endorsed by the “best science”. After a backlash from scientists, the government clarified that it was not explicitly pursuing herd immunity, but would be taking measures at the “right time guided by the evidence”, all according to a plan which it did not share with the public. On 17 March, Imperial College released a study noting that it had revised the model the government had been using, and stating that suppressing the virus was in fact the best way to avoid a vast number of people dying. The earlier model did not include the ICU data shared in the Lancet on 24 January. Instead, it was similar, but much later information from Italy, that changed their recommendation. So, at the end of week, the UK government did a 180-degree turn, reversing what it had said only days previously. It made the decision to take the same measures other countries had in order to delay the spread of virus: closing schools except for the children of key workers, closing pubs and other gathering places, asking households to self-isolate for 14 days and focusing on scaling up testing to 25,000 tests per day over the next month. However, capacity issues and lost time mean that testing will take time to ramp up, PPE supply chains are strained, and all while patient numbers continue to increase as we follow Italy’s path. The twists and turns described above have created a climate where the public do not trust that the government is responding in their best interests. Many cannot say what the government’s strategy is, or are confused about how serious coronavirus is for their health. Communication during a crisis must be clear, transparent, open and responsive. The confusion over herd immunity, for example, has made people reasonably think that the government wants everyone to get the virus to protect the economy, that it is not taking more decisive action because this is not a serious threat, or that the government does not know what it is doing. None of these are the whole story, but such perceptions are certainly not helpful in a crisis. We had a choice early on in the UK’s trajectory to go down the South Korean path of mass testing, isolating carriers of the virus (50% of whom are asymptomatic), tracing all contacts to ensure they isolate as well, and at the same time taking soft measures to delay the spread. Instead, we watched and waited, and whether it was academic navel-gazing, political infighting, a sense of British exceptionalism, or a deliberate choice to minimise economic disruption over saving lives, we have ended up in a position where we are now closer to the Italy scenario than anticipated, and are faced with taking more and more drastic measures. Perhaps the delay was due to fears about a second wave of the virus, next winter. But why not then work on buying time for the NHS to prepare, for health staff to get PPE, to make testing available, to boost beds and equipment, to trial antiviral treatments, or get us closer to the point that one of the vaccine candidates being investigated might actually work. Why not use the time to learn more about reinfection by the virus, about immune response, which seems to affect who needs ICU care, and about who recovers spontaneously? To understand where this virus came from, whether it is indeed seasonal, and how it could mutate? Why give in at such an early stage unless the goal is to get through this outbreak quickly so that whoever is left can help get the economy back to normal? It is still not clear who exactly is advising the government, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and what factors the prime minister and his colleagues are taking into account in his decision-making. Where does all this leave us now? Given that we lost the window of containment several weeks ago, the only feasible path forward seems to be to put in stringent physical distancing measures to delay the spread of the virus. But these alone will not be enough. We also need to backtrack and start doing the mass testing, tracing and isolating that are integral to breaking chains of transmission. Putting these measures in place does not mean that we will immediately solve NHS capacity challenges, or that we will not see a massive rise in patients dying. They will, however, help to slow down the spread. We must also continue to push for the protection of the health workforce and frontline responders who are exposed to high viral loads. And we must race to make up for the time lost during two months of passivity. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2020-03-23 14:27:12+00:00,98150,2
98163,commentisfree/2020/mar/23/icu-doctors-tough-decisions-coronavirus-uk,Opinion,ICU doctors now face the toughest decisions they will ever have to make | Tim Cook,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/icu-doctors-tough-decisions-coronavirus-uk,"The most certain feature of a pandemic is uncertainty. For NHS health workers, this is all around us. Many doctors are now being “side-skilled” (a new term) so they can help provide intensive care to patients. It’s important that the public understand what intensive care units (ICU) are, as this will make clear what faces us in the coming weeks and months. In all major hospitals, the ICU is for patients with an illness that immediately threatens their survival. Treatment is provided with machines and drugs that take over the roles of their organs, while sedation suspends the patient and allows their body to recover. These kinds of treatment cannot happen on normal wards. Skilled care is provided by an army of nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists and dietitians. ICU doctors work together with radiologists, microbiologists, surgeons, cardiologists, physicians and pathologists. This level of intensity is normal for ICUs, but Covid-19 isn’t. Coronavirus patients needing ICU will be among the sickest – almost all will need breathing support, or what’s known as “level 3” care. On top of this, precautions to prevent infection among staff and other patients will increase work intensity even further.
To meet the increased demand of coronavirus patients, the capacity of ICUs need to be scaled up. But what does this mean? Some commentators have suggested that the capacity of ICU wards will need to increase sevenfold. In every NHS hospital, normal activity is being diverted towards this end – but it requires planning on four major fronts: space, staff, stuff and standards. The space required in ICUs is enormous: it includes side rooms for safe care, facilities such as oxygen, air, suction, IT and lab support and storage space. Staff who are trained are scarce, and many will be absent due to illness or isolation during the epidemic. Stuff is the hardware and disposables that are needed in abundance, and are currently procured through fragile supply chains. Standards are the complex working practices required to provide the best quality care we can deliver. In larger hospitals many patients undergoing complex surgery are subsequently admitted to ICU for treatment and monitoring. If this routine surgery requiring ICU can be paused, the four key needs of ICU capacity may be rapidly available. Beyond that, it becomes challenging. In smaller hospitals, where almost ICU admissions are on an emergency basis, demand just can’t be put on hold during a crisis. One solution is to take over hospital operating theatres. ICU medical staff may need to be supplemented by anaesthetists, all of whom will have ICU experience, and nurses by theatre staff, not all of whom will. Staff will need to work differently. In ICU it’s normal for one nurse to care for one patient. In the heat of the crisis this may need to change: one ICU trained nurse, supported by those with different training, could care for several. No healthcare system can be prepared for a crisis of this magnitude and speed. Staff across the country are taking extraordinary actions to create space and service. Hospitals are building their defences as best they can, but we do not yet know how high and hard the wave will hit. In normal times, ICU treatment saves many lives, but it is not a quick fix – and it may not be right for all patients. At their sickest, ICU patients will be sedated and their bodily functions performed for them; as they recover, they must repossess those faculties. Treatment in an ICU itself often leads to further frailty or new illnesses; as the body lies ill, it ages. Survival may be impossible, or it may be accompanied by a slow and incomplete recovery that can take months or even years.
A central tenet of medical care is that it should benefit the patient and be consistent with what they would want. Too often, discussions about risks to the patient’s life, the burden of treatment and the quality of life that follows, are not considered until the patient is too ill to be involved. Doctors and family must then work together to balance risks against benefits and act in the patient’s best interests. The ethical framework of medical care is centred on doing good, avoiding harm, being fair and ensuring patients are enabled to make their own decision. These principles guide every decision to admit or not to admit patients to ICU. The magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic will involve making decisions that, in normal times, doctors aren’t confronted with: decisions about which patients to treat in ICU when not all can be. In Italy, doctors have been forced to make these choices. This kind of decision-making, known as triage, is a practice borrowed from the battlefield, when doctors had to make decisions about where to focus their stretched resources. Some have stated that “doctors make these decisions all the time”. I disagree. Every day, doctors wrestle with decisions about what is right for the patient in front of them. But when resource-based triage occurs, the decisions become about what is in the “greater good” and “doing the best for the most”. This is a fundamental change. Where normally the doctors’ focus is solely on what is in the best interests of an individual, when resources are overwhelmed and not all patients can be fully treated, doctors may instead have to focus on what is in the best interests of society. In normal circumstances, the General Medical Council state that doctors must avoid such decisions. If this comes to pass in the UK, doctors will be making some of the hardest decision we have ever had to make.
But we can’t do this alone. If it becomes necessary, a framework to inform these decisions should be shared with the rest of society. In this urgent crisis we need a public discussion to help guide these difficult decisions, and clear advice from our medical, philosophical and political leaders. In the meantime the government and NHS are making unprecedented efforts to prepare the health service for the pandemic. The public can help reduce peak demand on the NHS by following the government’s social distancing and self-isolation advice. Heeding this guidance will reduce the risk of infection for you and others. It will create space in ICUs and may even save someone’s life. • Tim Cook is a doctor in an NHS intensive care unit",2020-03-23 13:44:49+00:00,98164,107

Coronavirus is spreading silently and malignantly, from our work and social spaces, out to our homes, into shops and back again. It preys particularly on vulnerable people – those already sick, people over 70.
In the UK, by the end of Saturday, we had reported more than 5,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 233 deaths. This is almost the exact number of cases and deaths Italy reported on 7 March. Two days later, the Italian government imposed a national quarantine. Even despite these extraordinary measures, which should start having an effect this week, in its latest figures, Italy reported 59,138 cases and 5,476 deaths. Its hospitals are overflowing far beyond capacity. Military trucks are transporting dead bodies to cemeteries in the country. The grim truth is that the UK is two weeks behind Italy, following a similar trajectory, with significantly fewer hospital beds. The British government has failed to properly digest the lessons from the countries which were infected before us. We wasted precious weeks pursuing an outlier “herd immunity” strategy, which contradicted World Health Organization advice and has been criticised by many public health experts. On Friday, Boris Johnson finally, reluctantly, and reportedly only because of pressure from French president, Emmanuel Macron, closed pubs, restaurants and social spaces. But many other shops and public spaces remain open. This weekend, images of packed London parks and flower markets circulated on the internet. The prime minister has advised people to stay at home, but there are no measures to limit crowds on public transport. Lives are different, but Brits are still going out.
It is not enough. The failure to take drastic public health measures now could have a disastrous impact on our NHS in April. Nurses and doctors are already struggling to cope. Given the exponential rates at which this disease spreads, hospitals are on track to be decimated in a few weeks’ time. Unnecessary deaths will happen because our hospitals are just too full. There is no doubt those in government are working incredibly hard, under immense strain, in unprecedented times. However, a picture is emerging that a combination of complacency and British exceptionalism may have cost lives which could have been saved if we acted more boldly. Despite what decision-makers may have thought, Britain is not naturally more resilient than Italy. Johnson should also have recognised the danger emerging in London by including its mayor, Sadiq Khan, in the coronavirus Cobra meetings from the start. An examination of what went wrong in the UK government’s management in the early stages of this crisis will come at a later date. What matters now are the actions we can take to limit the numbers of coronavirus patients in the immediate future and prevent our health service from being over-run. First, Johnson should announce an urgent enforced lockdown in areas which are highly affected by the virus, including London, as has been demanded in an open letter by more than 40 of the country’s most senior scientific academics. Health interventions based on individual agency are never fully effective, as is demonstrated by decades of campaigns urging people to only drink in moderation. A regional approach to containment and travel restrictions, with strict limits on movement between areas of high and low infection, has been shown to be successful in China, which yesterday reported no new local cases for the third day running. France, another liberal democracy, has introduced its own strictly enforced lockdowns.
The urgent introduction of mass testing, alongside case isolation and contact tracing, is just as vital. As of 20 March, the UK had tested just 64,621 people for the virus. In South Korea, which has been testing up to 20,000 people per day, there has been a dramatic slowdown in infection. It was a relief last week when Johnson announced plans to increase testing to 25,000 per day, but, it is unclear when this promise will be fulfilled. We must support everyone trying to make this happen – in the NHS, in universities and research centres, in manufacturing and distribution – to speed things up. Health workers must be prioritised for tests. Without doing so, we do not know how many staff are self-isolating unnecessarily when hospitals need them. An enforced lockdown in London, and other hotspots, will rightly discomfort anyone with even the faintest liberal disposition. The freedom to move around is fundamental to our social contract. But if we continue to live as we please over the coming few weeks, the result will be thousands of unnecessary deaths. Us Londoners must be prepared to temporarily sacrifice our liberty to save lives. • David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham",2020-03-23 12:51:21+00:00,98180,2
98198,commentisfree/2020/mar/23/scientists-effects-coronavirus-children-studies-carriers,Opinion,What scientists know so far about the effects of coronavirus on children | Jonathan Ball,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/scientists-effects-coronavirus-children-studies-carriers,"At first it was only elderly people. The narrative about coronavirus, fanned by the details of every sad death announced, was that the virus was mainly a concern for those over 70, or people with serious underlying health conditions. These were the groups initially urged to socially distance themselves. But we’re beginning to see that coronavirus can make some younger people seriously ill. Crucially, although the majority of younger people and children will develop symptoms little worse than flu, they could be invisible carriers of the virus – and play a key role in its spread.
Compared to other European countries, the UK was slow in closing schools – waiting until there had already been 104 deaths due to coronavirus to take action. Studies from China showed children were rarely diagnosed with novel coronavirus, and therefore presumably had little role in the spread of the disease. But most of the diagnostic efforts in China, especially in the early phases of the outbreak, were heavily skewed towards hospital admissions. The majority of hospitalised cases involved adult patients. Did this mean that children and young people weren’t infected, or merely that they suffered more mild symptoms, which were going undetected? Like many of my colleagues, I could see no obvious reason why children weren’t being infected: this was a virus spread by the respiratory route, not through a process unique to adults. If significant numbers of children were infected and suffered very minor cold-like symptoms, then their potential to spread the virus was immense. One of the key differences between the novel coronavirus and Sars and Mers is that people with Covid-19 may have only mild symptoms – making it more difficult to detect. With Sars, most people infected quickly developed pneumonia. Identifying and isolating people with severe symptoms is a relatively easy task, and this made infection control through case identification and contact tracing comparatively easy. The current coronavirus is different. In more than 85% of confirmed cases symptoms can go undetected or be easily confused with the common cold of mild flu. Its biggest weapon – the thing that has, according to one study, allowed it to spread so easily – is this ability to cause mild disease in the majority of people it infects. When you can’t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, case identification and infection control are far more difficult. Far from being uninfected by this virus, children could in fact be its unseen carriers, important links in community transmission chains. But there’s still an important piece of the jigsaw missing. While many of us suspect that children have a key role to play in this outbreak, hard evidence to support this belief is still lacking. In perhaps the largest study of its type, Chinese researchers examined infection outcomes in more than 2,000 confirmed or suspected childhood cases of Covid-19. Just over half of the children had mild cold-like symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Severe and critical diseases, where body oxygen levels are low and various organs are under threat, were seen in around 5% of the children studied, with the youngest (under one year old) most at risk. There are still significant gaps in this analysis. Importantly, most of these were suspected rather than confirmed Covid-19 cases. But this study does at least reaffirm that most infections in children are mild. Judging from past pandemics, school closures can be an effective way to reduce the spread of a virus – particularly when they form part of a larger programme of social distancing measures. Every school day, children congregate en masse, often in close proximity, and then return home, taking with them any new infection they’ve picked up. Intuitively, reducing this cycle should help slow the virus.
By assuming that the young and healthy weren’t at risk, the UK government may have underestimated the effects of coronavirus. Indeed, reports of hospital admissions show that even among younger people this is a virus that can cause serious disease. A study from the US shows that 38% of 508 patients hospitalised with coronavirus were aged between 20 and 54 (children under 19 accounted for less than 1% of the total admissions). Of these 508 patients, 121 were admitted to intensive care; nearly half of this group was under 65. As with most things in this pandemic, the idea that coronavirus only threatens older people is an oversimplification. Younger people and children are less likely to die from coronavirus, but their mild symptoms could make them contagious carriers of the virus – and they are more difficult to spot. • Jonathan Ball is professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham",2020-03-23 11:08:15+00:00,98199,2

For the doctor the issue is health; after testing the water supply he urges a shutdown and new pipes to be laid to save lives. The town’s mayor is concerned about the economic cost. Better, the politician reasons, to keep the town open and correct the problem gradually. In the moral combat that ensues it is the doctor who becomes alienated from the town he struggled to protect. The play’s message is a counsel of democratic despair: that might is more powerful than right. This insight has not been lost on the British government. Like Ibsen’s fictional politician, ministers refused to see the viral threat. Boris Johnson did not want to contemplate a draconian response. When they did act, ministers found they were behind in a global race for critical resources such as ventilators, testing capacity and personal protective equipment. The failure to move decisively to suppress the pandemic lies at the root of the mess. Rather than admit responsibility for being behind the curve, ministers refuse to apologise and instead seek to delegitimise the media for asking questions about why Britain failed. Downing Street claims that “many people will be looking at our apparent success”. Having lost more than 26,000 lives to the coronavirus pandemic, the UK now accounts for an eighth of the world’s Covid-19 deaths with less than a hundredth of its population. If this counts as success, one shudders to think what might be considered failure. Every mistake invites a rebuttal. The government deploys a three-pronged denial familiar to observers of the Brexit culture wars. The first prong is to doubt that there is a serious problem; the second is to question the veracity of unwelcome reporting; last is to tar dissent as treason. Mr Johnson wants to co-opt the population in a national effort under his command. But Britain is set to lose more people in the coronavirus outbreak than in the blitz. He claims the frontline of the NHS has held, but does not want to own the heavy losses on the social care flank. The prime minister wants no narrative to take hold that could trigger a backlash on the home front that his administration cannot contain. Instead the government is attempting to use data to create the sense that the pandemic can be monitored as it happens. But daily numbers tell a distorted story. The missed target of 100,000 tests a day is a case in point. The volume of testing is not the issue; the question is whether it is extensive enough to map the virus spread so that it can be rolled back. South Korea has a population of 52 million but has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths by running 57 tests for every confirmed Covid-19 case. The number for the UK is less than a tenth of that. Britain has been too late in increasing its testing capacity, and nor does it have a tracing system to track down people who might have been exposed to the virus. Despite the facts, Mr Johnson will spend the weeks ahead claiming he will out-Korea the Koreans by halting virus transmission and will keep it in check with a “track, trace and test” approach. Performing this U-turn will open the prime minster up to the charge that he acted too late. Already the finger of blame is being pointed at the state, neglecting that it had been shrunk by a decade of Tory rule. Instead of sharing uncertainties with the public, Mr Johnson continues the self-deception. To err is human. Resolving the tension between the economy and health, as Ibsen’s play ultimately reveals, cannot be solved by the god of public opinion.",2020-04-30 18:39:21+00:00,98236,67
98309,commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries,Opinion,Coronavirus deaths: how does Britain compare with other countries? | David Spiegelhalter,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries,"At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Keir Starmer said he had added up a total of 27,241 coronavirus deaths so far, leaving the UK “possibly on track to have the worst death rate in Europe”. Is he right? Unfortunately, measuring the impact of the virus is a fiendishly complex task. It’s nothing like keeping score in a game. Starmer, as a lawyer, would know that we have to define our terms carefully. And so, assuming we want to make a comparison based on death rates, we first need to decide what a death rate is. You would think it would be easy for a bean-counting statistician to count deaths – the one certain thing (apart from taxes). But it is remarkably difficult. I have stopped taking much notice of the number given out at the daily press conferences, as it is only based on reports from hospitals, oscillates wildly around weekends, and recently included deaths that occurred a month ago. And this week the number of UK deaths jumped up by nearly 5,000 to 26,097 in one day – rather close to Starmer’s count – by retrospectively including non-hospital deaths that had tested positive for the virus. But even this is too low, as it does not include the many deaths of people who were not tested. The Office for National Statistics data on death registrations is the last word, although inevitably delayed by around 10 days, and these figures would be expected to take the current total to significantly more than 30,000. But we should be very cautious in comparing even this uncertain total with those of other countries.
Every country has different ways of recording Covid-19 deaths: the large number of untested deaths in care homes have not featured in Spain’s statistics – which, like the UK’s require a positive test result. The numbers may be useful for looking at trends, but they are not reliable indicators for comparing the absolute levels. If we were naive enough to take the counts at face value, the new figures propelled the UK past France and Spain into second place in Europe behind Italy, which is not encouraging because we are behind Italy in terms of what stage of the epidemic we are at. A more equitable metric might be Covid-19 deaths per million. Ignoring tiny countries, our current score of 388 puts us fourth, behind Belgium (632), Spain (509) and Italy (452).
But these are still deeply unreliable numbers, as it is not clear if we should just be looking at Covid-19-labelled deaths anyway. The effects of seasonal flu are not based on tests or death certificates, but at looking at the total number of deaths over the winter, seeing how many extra there are than a baseline, allowing for climate, and assuming these excess deaths were linked to flu. On average, over the last 10 years this has come to about 8,000 flu-related deaths, rising to 26,400 in 2017-2018 and 28,300 in 2014-15. Many feel that excess deaths give a truer picture of the impact of an epidemic. The latest ONS figures reveal that in the week ending 17 April, the week after Easter, around 22,500 deaths were registered in England and Wales, compared with an average of around 10,500 a week at this time of year. Nearly 9,000 of these had Covid-19 on their death certificate, but that leaves 3,000 extra deaths – more than 400 a day – essentially unaccounted for. Many of these will be indirect effects from the disrupted health service: routine treatments have been largely abandoned, A&E attendances and non-Covid-19 hospital admissions have plummeted. But, of course, people are not so interested in the numbers themselves – they want to say why they are so high, and ascribe blame. But if it’s difficult to rank this country, it’s even trickier to give reasons for our position. Covid-19 mainly harms the elderly, with the average age of deaths above 80, and its fatality rate doubles every seven years as a person ages. Italy’s population is elderly (it has a median age of 47), while Ireland’s is much younger (a median age of 37), so we would expect different effects. And Covid-19 is a disease of crowded areas – New York is rather different from Reykjavik. An obsessive comparison is being made between Norway and Sweden: Sweden’s more relaxed social distancing policies may or may not have been instrumental in their current death rate being 233 per million, compared with Norway’s 38. Even if we reach some sort of stable situation – if we can imagine it – will we ever know the direct and indirect health effects of the epidemic, taking into account reduced road accidents, the benefits of reduced pollution, the effects of recession and so on? Many studies will try to disentangle all these, but my cold, statistical approach is to wait until the end of the year, and the years after that, when we can count the excess deaths. Until then, this grim contest won’t produce any league tables we can rely on. • David Spiegelhalter is a statistician and professor of the public understanding of risk. • This article was amended on 1 & 8 May 2020.

98324,commentisfree/2020/apr/30/captain-toms-birthday-100-years-nhs-crisis,Opinion,It's Captain Tom's birthday. The past 100 years should teach us a powerful lesson | Danny Dorling,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/captain-toms-birthday-100-years-nhs-crisis,"Tom Moore entered the world on 30 April 1920 as Britain was emerging from the worst pandemic since mortality records began: the influenza of 1918-19. Total mortality in the UK rose by 24% in a year in 1918. Tom was just nine years old when the bitterly cold winter of 1929 increased mortality by 15%, and a newly married husband aged 48 when the influenza pandemic of 1968 led to a mortality increase of 6%. We do not yet know how Covid-19, the pandemic that inspired Captain Tom to begin his record-breaking walk at the age of 99, will rank in this deadly league table; yet it will almost certainly be less deadly than the events of 1918, 1929 or 1968.
In 1937, when Tom was 17 years old, there was no National Health Service. It was a time of mass unemployment and mass poverty. One shilling in every six earned in Britain went to the best-off 1% of the population. The vast majority of Britons were poor. If they fell ill, they had to pay to see a doctor, or hope for charity. When 20-year-old Tom was conscripted to the war effort in 1940, Britain began to change faster than it ever had before; the next 17 years would be some of the most remarkable in UK history. In 1957, when Tom was 37, the best-off 1% in the UK took only 9% of all national income. A great transformation had taken place and people were told they had never had it so good. But it would get better.
The influenza of 1968 returned in 1970 and again in 1972. One million people died worldwide. Yet it was a time when the global population was younger because of lower life expectancy than today; and it was a time of growing optimism and equality. By the time Tom was 57 years old in 1977, the best-off took less than 6% of all income in Britain; three times less than when he was aged 12. It was the smallest share they have ever taken; housing was affordable and there was full employment. Tom could have expected the situation to get better still. But a very different UK emerged instead. Margaret Thatcher’s election in 1979 heralded 18 years of radical Conservative economic policy. In 1997, when he was 77, the take of Britain’s 1% had doubled to 12% of all national income. When Tom turned 87, after a decade of “New” Labour, the share of the best-off 1% had risen to over 15%, which meant that inequality had returned to the levels they were when Tom was a very young man. Today the very best-off 1% in Britain receive around 14%, or a seventh of all income. At the start of this century our leading politicians believed that the rich should be rewarded and the poor should be bullied. Though not very long from now, we may look back and see that it took the Covid-19 pandemic to bring to a halt the rise in economic inequality. Though prime minister Boris Johnson likes to talk of “levelling up”, the coronavirus pandemic has instead resulted in a levelling down. Many Britons with no wealth will fall further into debt this year. Yet it’s estimated that a third of FTSE-100 companies have cut their chief executive’s pay as a result of the economic shutdown; anyone whose wealth is held in stocks and shares has seen it collapse in recent months; and house prices are falling, and are likely to fall the most where they were highest.
Captain Tom’s fundraising achievement, for which he has been promoted to colonel, is a tribute to Britain’s belief that our NHS is worth preserving. But charity efforts even of this magnitude can raise only a tiny fraction of the billion a week needed if the UK it is to fund its health services to the levels of Germany. Of all large European countries, it is Germany that has dealt with the pandemic the best. At first, the economic impact of Covid-19 looks devastating. But think back to the first half-century of Tom’s life. Think of how his situation changed from one in which living in poverty was very likely, through to a time when his children could expect to have well-paid jobs, enjoy full employment and start a family in their 20s if they wished. The last time economic inequality began to fall in the UK was around the time Tom was born, at some point between 1913 and just after the end of the first world war. The war debts could only be repaid by taxing the rich; no one else had enough money. The same is likely to happen again today, with the debts of lockdown and global recession. Coincidentally, a century after Captain Tom was born, the prime minister announced the birth of his own son. But there is no need for Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds’ baby to live through such a rollercoaster century. We should learn from the past 100 years: pull inequality down, but this time keep it down. • Danny Dorling is the Halford Mackinder professor of geography at the University of Oxford and author of Slowdown: The End of the Great Acceleration",2020-04-30 12:57:23+00:00,98325,2
98364,commentisfree/2020/apr/30/trust-tuberculosis-tackle-covid-19,Opinion,"The TB epidemic teaches us that the battle against Covid-19 won't be won in hospitals alone | Salmaan Keshavjee, Aaron Shakow and Tom Nicholson",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/trust-tuberculosis-tackle-covid-19,"There were three great pandemics in the 20th century. The influenza pandemic of 1918 and the HIV pandemic during the 1980s and 1990s get the most attention. But the third, tuberculosis, was the deadliest by far and in many communities, it’s not yet over. TB has much to teach us about the tools that can help to eradicate the current pandemic, and what happens when those tools aren’t even tried. The disease killed more than one billion people between 1800 and 2000. Although it is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, the disease shares some frightening similarities with this current coronavirus. The pathogen that causes TB is airborne, transmitted from person to person in households and social spaces. People with TB spread the bacteria to new individuals when they breathe. Only half of those with TB display symptoms, allowing the deadly disease to spread undetected. And like today, the most vulnerable people are hit the hardest — older people, those with underlying conditions and people living in poverty.
A century ago, TB was a terrifying reality for people all over the world. One in every nine deaths in the United States in 1906 was caused by tuberculosis (adjusted to our current population levels, this would be the equivalent of 540,000 Americans dying of TB every year). The disease killed as many people as cancer and diabetes, causing profound damage to economic and social life. Yet by the 1970s, rates of tuberculosis had dropped markedly in the US and other wealthy countries. How was this achieved? With the help of diagnostic treatments, the US pursued a successful strategy called “search, treat and prevent”. The key innovation wasn’t drugs (although antibiotics helped eradicate the disease, the first antibiotic treatment for TB was demonstrated in the 1940s, by which time cases of the disease had already fallen to around a fifth of 1906 levels). What made a huge difference was a community-based approach where people joined together to stop the spread of disease. The first step was freeing the sick of social and financial burdens. This allowed them to come forward for testing, care and support, without having to keep working and spreading the disease in the process. To this day, some of the only free health services available to everyone in the US are those relating to tuberculosis. Health authorities in the US went door to door searching for those who were sick and tracing people they had contacted. They treated sick people with food, medicine and shelter, and offered preventative therapies to stop others from becoming sick. Free TB care was only made possible through stable financing and community support, and cooperation between governments, employers, unions, faith groups and communities. Government financing and a community-based strategy were the key advances that made it possible to eradicate TB. But in many poor countries struggling with the pernicious legacy of colonialism, concerns about the cost of treatment trumped overwhelming scientific evidence. Instead of identifying and treating cases of TB across the population, these countries treated only the sickest and most infectious people. Focusing on the most extreme cases made sense, but it did little to stop the spread of the disease among asymptomatic carriers. In poorer countries, the results have been devastating: TB is the biggest infectious killer of adults globally, and continues to kill on average 4,000 people every day, mostly outside wealthy countries. These different approaches to treating TB can teach us much about the right and the wrong way to stop Covid-19. One of the main things we learned from TB is that epidemics can’t be beaten in hospitals alone. Eradicating a disease like this has to take place in the community. Treating Covid-19 will depend on community testing, either across a population or by using methods of cluster sampling. There are multiple ways to curb community transmission of the disease – from face masks that prevent people from spreading particles that carry germs, to physical distancing measures and self isolation. We should also be examining how existing technologies, such as germicidal ultraviolet lighting and vaccines that we already have at our disposal could help protect against the transmission of Covid-19. Crucially, we shouldn’t wait for a killer app or a vaccine to treat the coronavirus. Effective antibiotics weren’t discovered until years after TB had receded in affluent countries. Covid-19 might be different; if it behaves like other coronaviruses, those who have been infected may become immune. But the quest for a “silver bullet” shouldn’t detract from interventions already known to work. The fight against tuberculosis showed that treating a pandemic only in one part of the world isn’t enough to eradicate a disease. An estimated two-thirds of tuberculosis cases in wealthy countries today originate in places where a comprehensive response to TB was never implemented. Defeating a pandemic requires a global commitment.
But the key to a successful community-based strategy isn’t just case-finding or quarantine, though they will both play a role. It’s trust. Why is trust so important? With TB, as with Covid-19, more than half of the people with the disease exhibit no symptoms. If people do not come forward to be treated, and don’t consent to be tested, or if they are unable and therefore unwilling to remain isolated, the process of treating the disease can’t even begin. People must be able to trust that they won’t individually bear the catastrophic health expenses incurred from fighting the virus. This means providing housing and employment support for everyone who needs to isolate, and ensuring that people who are sick or isolating don’t forgo their wages to do so. If the economic and social risks of Covid-19 aren’t shared across the population, the next wave of the pandemic could be dramatically worse. It’s only through mutual trust that we will find those infected with coronavirus, help the sick recover and halt its spread. Ensuring that countries across the world have the resources to pursue a strategy of testing, treating and preventing the virus will be far less costly than the effects of another outbreak on the global economy. We know from history that this is the only way to stop the virus in its tracks. • Salmaan Keshavjee is the director of the Harvard Medical School Centre for Global Health Delivery.

A shared paradigm, observed Kuhn, is a mode of seeing a problem that makes certain presumptions and privileges particular perspectives. It sees things. But it also misses things. As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, the British government relied on the wrong paradigm. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has insisted that herd immunity – the idea that allowing a virus to spread will eventually build up sufficient resistance in a population – was never a “part of the plan” in the battle against Covid-19. But today’s Guardian’s investigation into the government’s early handling of the crisis leaves little room for doubt: the concept was fundamental to the government’s decision-making in the crucial months of February and March, as most of the rest of the world took a different path. It was abandoned only when it became clear that the NHS would be utterly overwhelmed and hundreds of thousands of Britons could conceivably die. There were other reasons why Britain remained a relatively relaxed outlier in early March, as Italy, France and Spain moved towards lockdowns and Germany followed South Korea in pursuing a rigorous test, trace and contact strategy. The distraction of Brexit played a part. A reluctance on the part of Boris Johnson to overly impinge on the rights of “free-born Englishmen” also influenced government strategy. It may have been assumed that because outbreaks of deadly diseases such as Sars-CoV had been confined to Asia, the new coronavirus would follow a similar pattern. Our investigation also suggests that ministers could have exaggerated the likely resistance from the public to more stringent measures. Above all, though, the framework was wrong. The laissez-faire blueprint for the government’s response to the crisis was overwhelmingly derived from previous experience of pandemic influenza. In the absence of a vaccine, flu spreads fast, becomes milder as it mutates, and populations can eventually acquire resistance once a majority of people have become infected. Herd immunity, distasteful as it sounds, can work. But as we now know, Covid-19 is horribly, devastatingly different. In the words of David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s envoy to Britain: “Coronaviruses are horrible. You can’t just let this thing … wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess and it will endanger health workers.” Britain finally entered into lockdown on 23 March. By then, the despair of overwhelmed Italian doctors had been broadcast around the world. That footage, and a now famous Imperial College advice paper, which predicted up to 250,000 deaths if the government’s strategy was continued, smashed the herd immunity framework. The same figure had appeared in a 2 March paper. Only now did it concentrate ministerial minds. Well over 26,000 Britons have died from Covid-19 and there are fears that Britain will emerge from the crisis with the worst fatality rate in Europe. The ministerial mantra has been that “the right decisions were taken at the right time”. But lives would have been saved if rigorous social distancing had been imposed earlier and the transmission of the virus reduced. This is a truth that should be acknowledged by the prime minister and his government. But it should also inform policymaking now that the debate has turned to easing the lockdown amid fears of economic collapse. There is still no vaccine – and nothing approaching a herd immunity strategy can be contemplated again. Until a testing regime can be established that matches the efficiency of those in Germany and South Korea, stringent restrictions must remain.

As a journalist with a public service broadcaster, I’m within my lockdown rights to do so, by the way. But feel free to scoff long and loudly at the notion that I’m any kind of essential worker. The film I left lockdown to make this week was all about keyworkers – midwives and nurses with Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS trust. Early on in the Covid-19 outbreak, the trust was concerned that new and expectant mothers were increasingly reluctant to come to clinics and hospitals for checkups. The call went out for help. West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa football clubs put their hands up, and so it is that the executive boxes at the Hawthorns and Villa Park are ringing incongruously with the sound of babies crying. I’ve been watching West Brom at this ground every other weekend since April 1974, and I’ve heard all manner of wailing and gnashing of teeth there in that time, but never babies crying.
I was beyond delighted to meet a four-day-old boy named Albie, after the club his dad supports and, with awesome serendipity, where Albie was presented for his first post-natal checkup. Babies of supporters of rival teams are also welcome, I should point out. The fascinating thing for me was how ideal the place is for this kind of clinic. One long-serving midwife told me she wished they could stay there for ever. It’s spacious and clean and there’s as much free parking as you like. Above all, bar the sweet music of babies crying, it’s a haven of peace and calm. Who would have thought it of the place where I have regularly been driven half-mad with stress for nigh-on 50 years. • Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-29 14:52:02+00:00,98542,16
98618,commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now,Opinion,What the 1918 flu pandemic tells us about whether social distancing works | Nancy K Bristow,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now,"As the world sees armed protesters in the United States demanding an end to “shelter-in-place” orders, reads stories of shopping malls in Brazil reopening as their president joins anti-lockdown protests, and hears laissez-faire voices call for their governments to “ease” restrictions as soon as possible, we might do well to look back at parallel moments in history. In recent days, striking images of scientific charts and graphs from the 1918 influenza pandemic have been making the rounds on social media. Though these hand-drawn diagrams may look archaic to our eyes, they offer a clear rebuke to those moving too quickly to step away from the public health restrictions so many around the world are currently enduring. In 1918, influenza swept the globe in a series of waves. Probably emerging in the spring of 1918 in the American midwest, this new virus moved through the US largely unnoticed by a nation at war. Soon, though, it travelled to Europe through American troops, infecting first combatants, then the entire continent and beyond. But this pandemic was only getting started. In late August a second, more deadly wave crashed on to the shores of the US, France and Sierra Leone almost simultaneously and rushed from there to sicken the entire world. This was, in many communities, soon followed by a third wave. When the virus finally slowed in 1920, an estimated 500 million people had been stricken worldwide, and 50 million to 100 million people had perished. Of those, 675,000 deaths were in the US.
As they faced this scourge in 1918, scientists lacked technology that would allow them to see the virus that caused it. The bacteriological revolution of the 19th century gave American medical and public health authorities confidence, though, that this was a contagious disease. Nationally, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) encouraged education and, if needed, a range of controls on Americans’ behaviour. It would be up to state, county and local leadership to make the decisions about how to manage the pandemic. Their choices proved critical. Public health leaders had a range of tools at hand. They began by training the population in basic hygienic practices – washing their hands and covering coughs and sneezes. The USPHS printed millions of pamphlets providing information on the disease and recommending precautions for avoiding and treating the illness. The American Red Cross published its own circular in eight different languages. Many communities passed laws against public spitting, and banned the common drinking cup still shared in public spaces such as schoolrooms and train stations. These were the easy steps. Soon, better ventilation was called for on streetcars, and some cities staggered work times and store hours to prevent crowding. The flu kept coming, and more comprehensive controls often followed. Bans on public gatherings, the closure of all but the most essential businesses, even prohibitions on weddings and funerals frequently followed. Some cities tried requiring the wearing of masks. Others turned to quarantining the sick. There were even cities that employed new and untested vaccines. But what’s most useful to us today is the comparative experience of Philadelphia and Seattle. Philadelphia, despite having some warning that the pandemic was coming, did little to prepare. Though Boston was under siege by late September, Philadelphia continued to conduct business as usual. On 28 September it hosted a massive kickoff parade for the Fourth Liberty Loan, the bond drive used to support the American war effort. Three days later the city reported 635 new influenza cases, and the situation soon worsened. Though the city now moved to protect itself, Philadelphia was overwhelmed by the epidemic. Available healthcare resources, already compromised by the war effort, were quickly stretched past their limits. Morgues overflowing with the dead, a desperate shortage of coffins and a resort to mass graves resulted from the city’s failure to move early to prepare. Philadelphia suffered one of the nation’s highest death rates.
Seattle offers a very different story. On 20 September, the city’s commissioner of health, Dr JS McBride, acknowledged that “it was not unlikely” that influenza would reach the city and warned the citizenry that, if it did, isolating cases would be necessary. When soldiers at nearby Camp Lewis came down with the flu, the camp was quarantined. On 4 October, the story broke that large numbers of students at the naval training station at the University of Washington had contracted influenza. Within two days the city had, despite significant opposition, closed schools, prohibited church services and shuttered many public entertainments. Crowding was prohibited in those businesses still operating. In the days to come, other measures followed. A local hotel was requisitioned for use as an emergency hospital. Spitting in public could mean a jail cell and public shaming, the wearing of masks was required in public, business hours were shortened and further limitations were placed on those allowed to remain open. Though he had initially hoped the pandemic would pass in less than a week, the health commissioner maintained the restrictions, even as the number of cases began to decrease. Finally, on 11 November, both the city and state announced an end to closures and masking. Not uncommonly, the city soon faced a return of the disease. Again the city acted, this time quarantining the sick. As a result of these actions, Seattle suffered one of the lower death rates on the West Coast, substantially lower than Philadelphia’s.
There was certainly opposition to the kinds of restrictions Americans faced during the 1918 pandemic. Church leaders routinely protested that, in the midst of a pandemic, their congregants’ needs were best met by access to religious gatherings. Business owners fought hard to stay open. Theatre owners pursued legal challenges, while opposition was voiced to school closures. In San Francisco, an “Anti-Mask League” organised against face-coverings. But the authorities that resisted this opposition fared the best. Research conducted by scholars at the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes clear that the “early, sustained, and layered” imposition of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing worked in 1918, slowing the pandemic’s pace and lowering death rates. And Seattle and Philadelphia offer a stark lesson – imposing “shelter-in-place” orders, as well as other measures such as public masking and the quarantining of the sick and infected, saves lives. They can do so again, if we can find the courage and the resources to maintain them. • Nancy K Bristow is a professor of history at the University of Puget Sound and is the author of American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic and Steeped in the Blood of Racism (published in July 2020)",2020-04-29 09:06:35+00:00,98619,2

I have just shown her a text message from a colleague. “The Covid round is arduous, take good care.” In the now forgotten past when we knew so little, I had agreed to join the Covid-19 roster. Now, with a global toll of 200,000, that casual offer has turned consequential. In preparation, I talk to my friend with Covid skills, a new category born just weeks ago. Slow down. Don and doff PPE (personal protective equipment) with great care. Carry your stethoscope in a kidney dish. Don’t touch your face. But it’s his last exhortation that strikes me. Remember that our patients are scared. Spend time with them and calm their fears. The irony of how to reconcile the sage advice with the natural instinct to get in and out of a room as quickly as possible doesn’t escape me. The night before the round, I memorise the PPE process, as if watching the video from three countries will make me thrice as safe. In the morning, I shed my wedding ring, find old clothes and head off quietly before the children wake up. No point in creating unnecessary drama.
The roads are deserted but the handover room in the hospital is bustling as the night and morning teams meticulously go through each admission. A ward of “suspects” await swab results. Patients, young and old, have arrived with many symptoms. The community rate of carriage is as yet unclear and the tests aren’t perfect, which means that some patients must be retested. One only has to cast an eye on the global havoc to appreciate that Australia has been guided into a very fortunate position, but no one thinks it’s time to relax. Consequently, every suspected patient must be considered positive and no clinician will let complacency trump caution. “Good luck,” everyone says to the Covid team, an acknowledgement of our increased risk. On the ward I am greeted by six doctors, three of them interns caught in this maelstrom within a month of starting their career. I feel for them. Why did I think the first decision of the day would be where to begin the round? “The consultant decides who goes in,” a trainee says. When I was still seeing cancer patients in clinic, I was shielded by everyone who understood the importance of keeping me safe to keep my patients safe. Now, that need has abated as outpatients have moved to telehealth. Suddenly, I recall my colleague’s words that had meant nothing at the time. “Just to let you know, I’ve been going in every time.” (So? Isn’t that how ward rounds work?) In the unequal world of medicine that aspires to lose its hierarchy but often comes up short, I realise that my seniority has bestowed upon me a privilege with life-and-death implications. Institutions around the world are trying to navigate the tricky balance of who is exposed to patients and how often, although in inundated places there is little choice. “I’ll go in,” I say. “I need to know the patients.” Shoulders relax. “Would you like someone to scribe inside the room?” “No, that’s unnecessary.” “Would you mind being watched as you don and doff?” Appreciating the care it takes to say this to one’s boss, I reply: “I’d really appreciate that.” The PPE feels foreign and being alone in every room is strange but once inside the pattern is the same. Take a good history, examine the patient, provide counsel. Don’t interrupt unnecessarily. Say urgent things calmly. Make eye contact even if it’s from behind plastic. A young woman is clammy and feverish. Her relief crashes when I say that her negative test doesn’t yet reassure me. An elderly man bursts into tears at his negative status. He only had a few years to live, anyway, he cries as his emotional nurse celebrates the end of his isolation. Other patients don’t speak English, can’t hear the interpreter and can’t operate a smartphone. For now, universal gestures for discomfort, breathlessness or nausea must do. Through the glass panel, one trainee has eyes set on me. The doffing is stressful because it’s when the wearer faces the highest risk of exposure. I remind myself to slow down and banish awful stories from my head. One cannot be a calm and methodical doctor without making some sort of peace with the knowledge that one or more patients could be infectious. It would be unproductive and frankly indulgent to view every minute spent seeing patients as self-sacrifice. Resentful doctors can’t be effective doctors. On the other hand, to be loose with words or ignore the very real consequences of sloppy hygiene or lax protection would be unconscionable. I work my way through these new learnings, pausing outside between patients to dictate notes and still trying to find teaching moments, which mostly have to do with the importance of empathy. When everyone is on edge, we really are in it together. Late in the afternoon I reach the final patient and the stakes truly rise because he is a confirmed patient who was not expected to live. My colleague had emphasised the emotional flux of such patients who prepared to die but find themselves alive, not sure whether to feel guilty or glad. He is pacing the room, looking dejected. But his numbers look so good that I feel a stirring of happiness.
“Would you like to go home today?” He stops short in his track. No matter how little English they possess, no patient has ever been confused by “home”. “For real?” he stammers. “Yes.” He starts crying, not having dared to imagine leaving alive. I’ve removed my gown when he reaches out to hug me. I leap back, surprised by my own agility but also embarrassed to treat him as untouchable. Embarrassed, he retracts. On the spur of the moment, I extend my gloved hand because anything less feels churlish. He says what every patient does. Thank you for saving my life. I think what every doctor does. Actually, I did nothing; your body held up. The rounds done, the team debriefs, remembering everyone working in far graver circumstances. I exit through a staff entrance and take in the queue of anxious visitors waiting to get in for the hour they’re permitted. At least I am heading home, I think. At least my kids won’t have to wave at me from behind glass as I drive past. People were sick and scared but at least no one died on my watch, I think gratefully, scarcely able to imagine what it would be like to move from one dying patient to the next and the next. And not for the first time, I feel incredibly lucky to work in a universal healthcare system that has again shown its very best side. We should never stop holding it accountable but hopefully this experience will provide answers for sceptics and be the impetus to acknowledge every individual, especially those outside the limelight, who make the Australian healthcare system that jewel that it is.

Comparing Covid-19 to a street mugger, the prime minister said that as a result of ongoing lockdown measures, the country has begun to “wrestle it to the floor”, as recorded infection rates and NHS hospital deaths from the disease fall from their early April peaks. Not for the first time in his career, Mr Johnson’s rhetoric was vivid, but it expressed at best a partial truth. Barely 24 hours later, the Office for National Statistics published an estimate by the Care Quality Commission that 4,334 people died from coronavirus in care homes in the fortnight leading up to 24 April. Half of those CQC-reported deaths occurred within the final five days. As the curve of hospital deaths flattens and begins to descend, Westminster’s political energies have moved restlessly on to the question of how lockdown restrictions might be eased. But care workers are bracing for a deadly peak that has yet to come. The struggle to protect the nation’s vulnerable and elderly must not be fought in lonely isolation, out of sync with the national mood. At the Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed that the potential crisis in care homes “was something we focused on right from the start”. But that social care became the forgotten frontline of the coronavirus crisis is generally accepted. This week, we learned that ministers were warned by scientific advisers in January that care homes would be especially vulnerable to a pandemic. From personal protective equipment to testing, the response from the government to that advice was belated and inadequate. What is urgently needed now is the application of genuine political imagination to mitigate a tragic situation which is moving towards a deadly climax. Care homes need immediate help in three specific areas – medical equipment, human resources and financial capability. The proper provision of PPE for care workers must be made an absolute priority for the government. Access to increased testing capacity, which remains haphazard and sketchy, must be vastly improved. Mr Hancock has announced that care homes will now be able to test asymptomatic as well as symptomatic carers and residents. This is welcome, as is the commitment to publish daily figures on care home deaths. But when some care homes are still struggling to perform any tests at all, the promise doesn’t count for much. The National Care Forum, which represents 120 not-for-profit providers, has called for acute care specialists and geriatricians normally based in the NHS to lend their expertise in managing outbreaks. Their knowledge, and the experience they acquired during the early April hospital peak, could be an invaluable resource. About 25,000 retired doctors and nurses responded to government calls to return to the NHS; their skills would be a vital boost in residential homes. Members of the 750,000-strong NHS “volunteer army”, most of whom have not been called on, could be diverted to perform specific tasks. Meanwhile, a financial lifeline from central government is also desperately needed: myriad extra costs have left large numbers of providers close to the edge. The NHS has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. Mr Johnson was right to celebrate that fact as he returned to Downing Street. The belated lockdown gave hospitals the headroom they needed. The same sense of urgency must finally inform the government’s response to the crisis in our care homes.",2020-04-28 18:35:24+00:00,98712,67
98770,commentisfree/2020/apr/28/boris-johnson-coronavirus-mug-britain-pm-cabinet,Opinion,Boris Johnson is tough on crime. Except when coronavirus wants to mug Britain | Marina Hyde,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/boris-johnson-coronavirus-mug-britain-pm-cabinet,"Exciting news in Johnsonian linguistics this week, as the prime minister’s coronavirus response moves beyond his previous “send it packing” metaphor. Perhaps this is encouraging. I’m no expert in clinicalese, though judging by Johnson’s own repeated experience of being sent packing, this suggested that we are currently dropping bin bags of the coronavirus’s clothes from an upper-storey window. But also that it will have wangled its way back in by November, going “I’ve changed”. Mutated, whatever. Johnson has now decided the virus is a “mugger”. On Monday, he explained that “this is the moment we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor”. Which is one way of drawing a veil over the fact he effectively took the mugger to the rugby at Twickenham on 7 March. People say the other parties are soft on crime, but at least they don’t throw 250,000-strong race meetings for it. At least they don’t watch it mug Italy and Spain then leave everyone’s valuables unattended while they bin off some Cobra meetings to finalise a divorce or keep the pubs open or do whatever the Johnson government preferred to do for those lost weeks as we watched the virus coming towards us via the seemingly uninstructive experiences of other countries.
For those fortunate enough not to have lost loved ones to a grim and lonely death, or to be one of the millions requiring food aid, there is vital debate as to what will come to be seen as the prevailing coronavirus mood. Will it be mild breadmaking disappointment, or faux self-deprecation about the homeschool pupils being cleverer than the teacher? It’s certainly a dilemma. But can I go for neither? It feels more likely that the spirit of the times will be a mass choosing-to-forget – a vast absent-mindedness that will settle over the cock-ups like a psychic pall. Why don’t we expect better? I guess it saves time. Never mind the belated U-turn on locking down, never mind the abandonment of contact tracing, never mind that the government ignored a warning from its own advisers to stockpile crucial kit, leaving it without essential pandemic supplies when the virus hit, never mind that not counting deaths outside hospitals places the toll somewhere north of double the current official figures. Instead, imagine these and other unfortunate matters being nailed and padlocked into crates, to be stored in the vast government warehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. As the blustering bureaucrat lies to Indiana Jones, they have “top men” working on this stuff.
Our own government’s “top men” emerge daily at 5pm from the double doors at Downing Street, which is just a puff of dry ice short of a performance we might call Sars in Their Eyes. Think of this repertory company of cabinet ministers as the Good News Bears. You can certainly always rely on a scenery-chewing performance by Matt Hancock, whose overacting increasingly rivals even some of the Harry Potter cast. Hancock doesn’t so much play to the back row as to the international space station. As for the press they’re getting, the government is preposterously lucky with some of its critics. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic – which possibly originated in North America – was called the Spanish flu because the country seemed particularly hard hit by the disease. It wasn’t. The Spanish newspapers had just faithfully reported its devastating effects. Unlike Spain, a neutral power in the first world war, countries like the UK and the US were saddled with legislation banning reporting that lowered morale. This led to what is often classed as a catastrophic failure of the fourth estate. Vital health reporting was relegated to dismissive paragraphs, so mass gatherings went ahead and the bitterest harvest was reaped. Meanwhile, papers such as the Washington Times went big on things like a picture of a soldier chasing a turkey wearing a fez, beneath the headline THANKSGIVING IS COMING! Thanksgiving was a month away at the time.
We don’t have censorship in the current pandemic, of course. So there is no legal reason the Sun should run the death toll as a tiny disease particle on page one, failing to attach itself to the vast headline announcing “PUBS SHUT TILL XMAS”. Presumably, the approach is popular. So a lot of people think journalists aren’t asking enough tough questions – and even more think they shouldn’t be asking questions at all. For them, the only tolerable debate is the lockdown debate – which palpably suits the government. The Good News Bears love the lockdown debate. Why wouldn’t they? Every second you’re having the lockdown debate is a second you’re not having the debate that starts “how in the name of our necrotic self-respect are we on course to be the worst-hit country in Europe when we had so much warning?” Ah well. Perhaps these are not deemed seemly British discussions. Or to put it another way, you won’t catch us getting mugged by reality. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-28 15:09:25+00:00,98771,67
98774,commentisfree/2020/apr/28/lockdown-restrictions-solidarity-coronavirus-social-distancing,Opinion,The lockdown in our minds will be the last restriction to be lifted | Rafael Behr,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/lockdown-restrictions-solidarity-coronavirus-social-distancing,"Watching old movies, it is easy to be shocked by all the gratuitous touching. By “old” I mean anything recorded before March 2020, when people were still squeezing past each other to get to the bar, exchanging grimy coins and passing drinks back with their dirty bare hands. Did we really throng like that? It is a measure of how well we have internalised the reason for staying apart that casual, pre-coronavirus intimacy looks so alien. When we cringe at an old photo of ourselves with bad hair or clothes (or both, in my case) it is because we apply the lens of new information to judge our naive former selves. And now a whole world of slack hygiene feels remote in that sepia-tinted way; not just in time, but in values. The change is cultural, not political, and will not be undone by government decree. Even when some shops are allowed to trade or schools partially reopen, the duty to be distant will remain for as long as contagion is a risk. In the absence of a vaccine, that risk is open-ended. It will be a while before strangers shake hands again. Maybe the habit will be lost. This is not a superficial aspect of the Covid-19 crisis. Societies are shaped by custom and ritual as much as they are held together by legislation. There is no law against queue-barging, for example, but British people still have a keenly developed sense of justice around the issue. We must not underestimate the aggregate effect of curtailing millions upon millions of micro-niceties, even if we cannot predict what the impact will be. After the rules of lockdown are eased, the cordon sanitaire will remain in our minds. Each handshake or shared bag of chips is a little social contract – a declaration of affinity. And without physical proximity we have to work harder to negotiate those alliances. It isn’t hard to see how our species evolved this way. There is an obvious cost in admitting predators and enemies into our personal space, so we are hard-wired to associate social distance with suspicion. The same applies in the case of hygiene, where we have evolved what the psychologist Mark Schaller has called a “behavioural immune system”. At an individual level that is the spasm of recoil from a foul smell. At a more complex level it informs antisocial human characteristics – wariness of all things unfamiliar, especially people from outside our immediate, trusted circle. Evolutionary biologists have observed a cross-cultural and historical correlation between the prevalence of infectious disease and authoritarian politics. The theory posits that “pathogen stress” leads to a more aggressive behavioural immune response, making societies less open, less tolerant and readier to sacrifice liberties for collective protection. That might sound like a wild extrapolation from two-metre gaps at the supermarket checkout. I don’t think lockdown will activate some dormant genetic predisposition to tyranny. The opposite response feels closer to the surface – our pent-up social energies one day exploding on to the streets in a licentious touchy-feely carnival. But that release might be further away than we hope. Meanwhile, it doesn’t take an evolutionary biologist to hypothesise that chronic insecurity ploughs fertile ground for toxic politics. That is a lesson from the rise of xenophobic nationalism across Europe and the Americas in the decade since the last financial crisis, amply corroborated by evidence from the first half of the 20th century. History is not destiny, so it is reasonable to presume that 21st century societies will find innovative ways to manifest the consequences of mass anxiety. For a start, we have the digital infrastructure that means a lot of life in lockdown has migrated online. That journey is keeping many of us in financial solvency and mental equilibrium, but with an insidious cost in social cohesion. Before coronavirus, people were already burrowing into digital silos, selecting the information that suited their prejudices or having that information selected for them by algorithms that interpreted prejudices from their search history. Social media is a brilliant centrifuge, separating us into discrete cultural channels, and an efficient engine for radicalisation, polarisation and paranoia within those channels. Shared attitudes are refined; the grit of contradictory evidence is expelled; moderates fall silent while members of the group bid each other up towards the most extreme iteration of any opinion. That is how people make a journey at astonishing speed from unfocused alienation to murderous militancy; from vague mistrust of Westminster to deranged conspiracy theory. Politicians are as susceptible as everyone else, whipping each other into factional rages in their WhatsApp groups. In normal times, that process is slowed by friction from everyday brushes with analogue reality. We might not have seen fleeting conversations at football matches or on the bus as part of our social life, but each interaction with a stranger exercised muscles of empathy and diplomacy that are atrophying. We are now zooming deep into culturally reinforced comfort zones. It doesn’t have to be that way. The antidote to polarisation is solidarity and there is heaps of that around. The weekly ritual of doorstep applause for the NHS is rightly cherished as an expression of communal spirit to transcend isolation. Images of those moments will be displayed as icons of national togetherness for generations, like the photos of Londoners seeking shelter from the blitz in tube stations, except there won’t be so many people jammed together in the frame. That is no minor difference. We know there is a vast reserve of solidarity available and that it could be a healing social balm after years of painful division. But it is also a perishable commodity that degrades if left up on the shelf of abstract rhetoric. It needs to be applied in person and it is hard to bring people together without physically bringing people together. Economic redistribution is the traditional way to put solidarity into political practice, and there might be more public appetite for that than there has been for decades. But it isn’t guaranteed, nor is financial inequality the only gap that will need bridging. The politics of quarantine have focused on the sacrifices involved, on the requirement for discipline and the challenge of repressing our socialising urges. The presumption has been that the springs will uncoil as soon as the pressure is released, and the old ways will bounce back. But not if the virus has corroded the mechanism. Some habits of trust might have to be relearned. It might require effort on a political and individual level to practice social un-distancing – to reach out of our digital boltholes. Repairing the damage done by this disease will be a project of cultural reconnection, not just economic redistribution. We will need new ways to feel joined for as long as we cannot take each other by the hand. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-28 14:38:08+00:00,98775,2
98814,commentisfree/2020/apr/28/oxygen-levels-coronavirus-symptoms-oximeters-gp,Opinion,Should you be checking your own oxygen levels if you have coronavirus symptoms? | Ann Robinson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/oxygen-levels-coronavirus-symptoms-oximeters-gp,"Covid-19 is proving to be a many-headed monster. And though most people will steadily improve and recover, a small percentage (up 4%) suffer a precipitous, unpredicted and sometimes delayed decline. Experts are warning that waiting for the “classic” symptoms – difficulty in breathing and high fever – may mean that some cases of pneumonia and other complications may be missed. But how do you know whether you’re the one who will need hospitalisation? Will you end up in ICU? How do you know when you’re out of the woods? And are there any specific ways of assessing whether you’re getting better or worse? Most of us can put up with the sweats, aches, cough and deep fatigue for a few days if we know that we’ll turn the corner and begin a couple of weeks of gradual recovery. Michael, a 27-year-old coronavirus patient, told me: “At first, it was like wading through a sea of treacle just to reach the loo. I felt like a small child was sitting on my chest so that breathing was really hard work. Then after a couple of days, my breathing eased and I could potter around my flat like my grandmother does, though a bit slower. The thought of going out for a 5K run, which I used to do in about 24 minutes, still feels impossible. But I’m in my third week and I can feel that I’m on the mend. I wish that someone had told me that it would take this long because not knowing is really scary.” As Michael’s GP, I would have been the obvious person to advise him on what to expect. But the truth is that the presentations, complications and consequences of this novel virus are still unfolding; the initial phone triage pathway that doctors like me were advised to follow at the start of the crisis was pragmatic and generally safe but didn’t cover the myriad exceptions to the rule that have since become apparent. One concern is that pneumonia can develop, which only causes symptoms of shortness of breath once it is at an advanced stage. Pneumonia occurs when the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become inflamed by a virus, bacteria, fungus or irritant particle and fill with fluid or pus, making it hard to breathe. Too little oxygen in the lungs means that the blood can’t pick up enough to carry to every organ and cell in the body (resulting in a condition called hypoxia). Sustained hypoxia causes organ failure and cell death. Administering oxygen via a mask or CPAP machine can help at first but if the alveoli are too bunged up then no amount of oxygen will help and mechanical breathing assistance (ventilation) becomes necessary. It can be hard to know when a chest infection that affects bigger airways but leaves the alveoli able to function is developing into a potentially dangerous pneumonia. Pointers are a temperature over 37.8C, a pulse rate over 100 beats per minute, crackling sounds heard through a stethoscope and oxygen saturation levels in the blood lower than 95%. A chest X-ray or CT scan may also show abnormalities that point to pneumonia. But none of these is entirely reliable on its own; for example, your pulse rate may be high if you’re unfit, anxious, have just consumed caffeine or have a fever from any cause. Oxygen saturation levels are a measure of how much oxygen is getting round your body and can be fairly reliably assessed with a little gadget called a pulse oximeter that clips on to your finger. Two wavelengths of lights are emitted by an LED inside the device on one side of the finger. The light that passes through the fingertip is measured and the amount that has been absorbed by the oxygen in the blood is calculated to give an oxygen saturation – or “sats” – reading. A figure is displayed, which is the percentage of the maximum amount of oxygen that the blood should carry, and the ingenious little gadget – which runs on one AAA battery – also displays heart rate. Pulse oximetry is a useful adjunct in deciding who needs treatment, admission to hospital, oxygen therapy, a transfer to intensive care, ventilation and then, at the other end of the tunnel, who can be safely discharged home and reassured that they’re on the mend. Oximeters don’t work well if your hands are cold, you have shellac on your nails or the battery is flat. Anyone who is too breathless to complete a sentence, has severe chest pain, is drowsy, confused or unable to stand up due to dizziness will need urgent assessment, usually with a 999 call. Relying on a sats measurement isn’t safe if you’re clearly seriously unwell and deteriorating. But in a more borderline call, a sats reading of over 96%, a heart rate under 90 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of under 20 breaths per minute are reassuring. GP surgeries have been given pulse oximeters to lend to patients at home to monitor their progress either as the infection is developing or as recovery kicks in. We’ve only got two for 5,000 patients and had a bit of difficulty getting one of them back from a patient who understandably wanted to hang on to it. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies (costing £20-60) and there are a lot of Chinese-made ones on eBay. But the real message isn’t to rush out to bag a pulse oximeter at all costs. The message is that this Hydra of a virus can present in insidious ways, especially in the frail and elderly. If you are feeling increasingly ill, confused or drowsy, don’t wait until you can’t breathe or until the pulse oximeter arrives. Get help: call 111 or your GP as a first step if you can, and 999 if it feels like you can’t wait. Ann Robinson is a GP",2020-04-28 12:01:08+00:00,98815,107

Go where, one wonders. We are to believe that he is fully recovered and able to make the life-and-death decisions of which his cabinet is apparently incapable. It is a sign of the strangeness of the times that I find myself agreeing with the health minister Nadine Dorries, who tweeted that most people who have been in intensive care with Covid-19 need months off, rather than weeks, work to regain their strength. Of course, we are supposed to think of Johnson as an exception to the rules he has been breaking all his life. Now he gets to make the rules, while trying to be upbeat, but still insisting on this ridiculous language of war and conflict. This is war as a game, in which there are victors and heroes who get medals while flags are waved. Real war is needless slaughter and torture and starvation, but that would spoil the metaphor of triumph. No one wins in a pandemic. The UK certainly isn’t winning now. We are set to have the highest death rate in Europe, so I am not quite sure what victory looks like – 50,000 or 100,000 dead? No amount of “Boris bounce” can dilute the blocks of loss on the graphs, or make us unsee the abandonment of the social care workers who look after those in “homes”, sleeping there overnight to avoid infecting their own families. The last week has been the toughest so far. The rate of infection is still very high, but people have torn protective tape off park benches to sit down. War and Peace remains unread. Lockdown diets went out of the window weeks ago. Mainly, we miss each other. Zoom is good for certain things, but it can certainly exacerbate one’s loneliness. I don’t understand why I must partake in the jolly quizzes that are shared with me, when I never did before. Likewise baking. My deprivation is minimal compared with that of many – I have had too many conversations now with people who have lost their incomes for the foreseeable future. Yet, as tough as it is, the majority of the population, right across the age groups, continues to support the lockdown, because we are not stupid. In places, patience is fraying, sure, and people are taking more risks, but still we fear death – not just our own, but that of our loved ones – more than recession. The sections of the rightwing press urging us to end lockdown, continually telling us the public is restless, always cite anonymous “Tory grandees”. These are millionaire donors who lather up discontent by saying long-term economic lockdown will destroy more lives than the virus. It is a pity they didn’t speak up after the last financial crash, which ushered in a programme in which the very poorest were punished for the sins of the bankers. Now, however, the public is ahead of the political elites. The dark side of lockdown, the fact it involves terrible individual suffering, is clear: domestic violence has moved from being low-level background noise to something we actually acknowledge; there has been an increase in uploads of child abuse images; for many cancer patients, treatment has stopped. But when asked to think collectively, to protect the vulnerable, it is a measure of people that most do. This is not a British quality, but a human one. (Indeed, our lockdown has not been as strict as that of many of our neighbours.) Whenever the lockdown is eased, Covid-19 will still exist and we will live with whatever we deem to be an acceptable level of death and risk. As individuals, we are poor at risk assessment. Adult conversations need to be had by this government. What are the risks for a healthy 25-year-old woman or a 55-year-old man? How many children have been ill? Why should we trust a government the strategy of which has been secretive and mostly too little, too late? The economy has shrunk; we all know that. We can grow it again, and more equitably, if the political will is there. It can be resurrected. The dead are locked down for ever. Stop this inane talk of saving lives versus saving the economy. It is a false binary. Health is wealth. If we don’t understand that now, we never will. Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-28 06:00:00+00:00,98884,67
98884,commentisfree/2020/apr/28/sports-and-exercise-medicine-helps-manage-chronic-disease-it-needs-better-funding,Opinion,Sports and exercise medicine helps manage chronic disease. It needs better funding | Nathan Luies for IndigenousX,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/sports-and-exercise-medicine-helps-manage-chronic-disease-it-needs-better-funding,"The Covid-19 pandemic is currently immobilising the world, causing fear, morbidity and mortality. The strict restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus as well as uncertainty about safety have meant access to healthcare services in both urban and regional areas has been significantly interrupted. These restrictions have forced us to rethink the way healthcare is provided and accessed by all Australians in the immediate future and in our long-term management of chronic disease. While we are considering how this restructure should occur, it’s worth remembering Indigenous Australia, where the ongoing problem of inequitable access to care continues to plague the system. This is only magnified by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Unsurprisingly some of our most vulnerable populations such as rural and remote Indigenous communities are those who need access to healthcare the most, and yet even before Covid-19 had the most limited access. With 44% of all Indigenous Australians living regionally and 19% in areas considered remote, a greater focus must be placed on servicing these communities. Despite the best intentions to close the gap for the past 15 years, there still remains a significant discrepancy in life expectancy between Indigenous men and women and their non-Indigenous Australian counterparts (nine years for males and eight for females). Cardiovascular disease and diabetes remain the two leading causes of deaths for Indigenous Australians and are worse in remote areas. Both diseases can be largely prevented and managed with lifestyle-based interventions, specifically exercise and diet. Breaking down the numbers, 13% of Indigenous adults have cardiovascular disease, it jumps to 18% in those living in remote areas and is responsible for 24% of all deaths. Furthermore 13% of Indigenous adults have diabetes. Those living in a remote area are twice as likely to have diabetes than those living non-remote. Indigenous adults are 3.5 times more likely to have diabetes than non-Indigenous adults. Both conditions are significantly associated with lifestyle factors including a lack of physical activity. The high burden of chronic disease experienced by Indigenous populations makes it essential they have access to healthcare services that can help them stay active and able to exercise as a cornerstone of effective management. Physical activity, sport and exercise are an integral part of Indigenous culture and should be used to maintain the health and wellbeing of its people. Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) physicians practice medicine and its application to physical activity, treating individuals wanting to exercise at all levels, not just elite athletes. They are the only medical speciality trained in exercise prescription, including for chronic disease. Exercise is being increasingly recognised for its essential role in the prevention and treatment of common chronic medical conditions, such as arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, many cancers and mental health. Exercise prescription in chronic disease is often complex – for example, consider a patient with type 2 diabetes and chronic undiagnosed knee pain who needs to gradually return to more activity without worsening their pain. Sports and exercise medicine physicians are uniquely placed to provide care to Indigenous patients by providing effective non-surgical management of musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis which may be limiting exercise and activity. In addition, the safe prescription of exercise is crucial and cost-effective in the long-term management of chronic disease. The downstream effects of managing these conditions effectively and keeping people more active can even reduce the risks of developing these chronic conditions in the first place. Most Indigenous Australians have limited access to sports and exercise medicine in cities, let alone in regional and remote areas. Currently in Australia sports and exercise medicine is not readily available in public hospitals, nor is it funded appropriately under Medicare compared to other medical specialities. This effectively makes bulk-billing clinics impossible, limiting the provision of care extensively, especially in regional and remote areas and to Indigenous patients. Despite a recent Medicare rebate review recommending equitable rebates for patients of SEM physicians, rebates for the specialty remain unchanged at levels below all other medical physician specialties, general practice and even allied health. Australia’s leading medical body the Australian Medical Association (AMA) does not constitutionally recognise sports and exercise medicine as an official specialty and did not support the recommendation of equitable Medicare rebates for all specialities.
The Australasian College of Sports and Exercise Physicians (ACSEP) is committed to expanding the provision of sports and exercise medicine into regional areas such as remote Indigenous communities. This immense task would be made infinitely more feasible with the support of the federal government, the AMA and equitable Medicare rebates. All Australians deserve readily accessible and affordable specialist guided exercise medicine for both prevention and management of chronic disease. This is even more pertinent for those at highest risk, such as our Indigenous population living remotely. Any restructure of our healthcare system during this period of change must prioritise this model of care if we are truly serious about improving Indigenous health and closing the gap. • Dr Nathan Luies MBBS BSc (physiotherapy) is a proud descendant of the Karajarri and Yawuru people.

98940,commentisfree/2020/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-tests-ideology-has-hurt-the-uk,Opinion,The Guardian view on coronavirus tests: political choices have hurt the UK | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-tests-ideology-has-hurt-the-uk,"The coronavirus pandemic struck the United Kingdom when its National Health Service was on its knees suffering from staff shortages and the longest waiting times ever recorded. A decade of austerity had taken a terrible toll. Yet public satisfaction in the NHS went up. This surprising gap between the NHS failures and the public’s belief in the health system seems to have been driven by the support from across the political spectrum for more funding. This probably, say researchers, started to impact on public perceptions, most notably on their optimism for the future. It would be a mistake to think the spread of Covid-19 can be checked by hope alone. The last 10 years have undermined the ability of the government to respond effectively and efficiently. As the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty told the Guardian, the “most damaging aspects of ‘austerity’ cannot and will not be undone” and represent “the fatal weakening of the community’s capacity to cope”. Even today ideology plays a bigger part in the government’s response than many insiders care to admit. A more proactive mindset might have seen the state mobilise an effort to track down those in need of a coronavirus test and offer it to them. Instead voluntarism remains the creed of the current government which opted for an online booking system for tests that was predictably overwhelmed within hours. In the coming weeks there will be an argument about whether the shutdown is more deadly than the virus. The case for lifting the current restrictions can be rooted within Conservative thought which privileges individual autonomy and the promotion of individual responsibility. Calls for these to be dogmatically pursued run in the face of evidence that the old and the poor are more vulnerable to the disease. A virus as communicable as Sars-Cov-2 means that the health of the richest is dependent on the health of the poorest. It does not make sense for at-risk working-age adults to return to jobs in which there are numerous social contacts. Having emptied Covid hospital wards, would this not just risk filling them up again? Whitehall also has to find a way of ensuring press releases are realised on the ground in the country. Before the Conservative state-shrinking began in 2010, there had been government offices of the regions which could operate between ministerial departments and the various bodies, often very local, that are charged with implementing policy. These overlapped with regional health bodies and could deliver policy around the country. It is an open question as to what coordinating body will do that today. Another aspect of Conservatism is, as Samuel Johnson opined, that “order cannot be had but by subordination”. The government has had to be pushed into saying it will be transparent about its scientific advice. It has a track record in adopting tactics to choke off critical voices. Tory ministers neutered the Health Protection Agency and brought the often loud scientists and doctors who led it to heel 10 years ago. Its successor is Public Health England, which is accountable to the health secretary, and led by a career NHS manager. Lost is an opportunity for an independent voice to speak influentially about important health matters. Ministers are about to make a series of political choices that they will undoubtedly present as a natural response to be instituted so life can rebound. These choices may be informed by science. But they will be guided by a particular political morality, which will not be as evidence based or as rational as science.",2020-04-27 18:05:43+00:00,98941,2
99010,commentisfree/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-back-to-work-waffling,Opinion,It's good that Boris Johnson is back to work. But he is waffling  | Simon Jenkins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-back-to-work-waffling,"Boris Johnson’s swift return to duty is welcome. He has clearly been through a personal nightmare. Given the pressures on him, he deserves sympathy and congratulations. In his address to the nation this morning he was characteristically Churchillian. He says Britain has come through coronavirus so far with flying colours. “Now we must prepare to win phase two as we have won phase one.” It is hard to know what news the prime minister has been watching or listening to. Johnson’s language was opaque to the point of waffle. The British people are in the dark, more so than any in Europe. Though statistics are still desperately unreliable, all we do know is that Britain has not performed well during the coronavirus pandemic. It is now among the most dilatory nations in securing recovery. The only strategy mentioned by Johnson was the need to “eliminate the risk of a second spike”. There is no way such a risk can be eliminated, short of never taking it. But it is unacceptable to hamstring the entire economy indefinitely, as Johnson implied, merely to stop further infection “overwhelming our NHS”. The unpreparedness of the NHS has contributed to Britain’s plight. Its future “protection” is not a sufficient reason for the scale of cost now being imposed on the economy. If there is another spike, the NHS must be helped to face it. The rest of Europe – an entity Johnson despises – is already well advanced into what he presumably means when he says phase two. Yet his speech was empty of specifics. There was no indication of ending the bias against the private care sector, the neglected “poor bloody infantry” of coronavirus. While the cabinet built now largely empty Nightingale hospitals and stalled operations, the elderly and those caring for them were left at serious risk, a glaring failure of a “nationalised” health service. If you want to nationalise welfare, nationalise it all. Meanwhile the illogicalities of lockdown grow more absurd by the day: the banning of bench-sitting in parks, the closure of rural resorts and beaches, permitting supermarkets to open but not garden centres or small traders. Covid-19 is clearly lethal chiefly to specific sections of the community, yet the current one-size-fits-all shutdown ignores this. And if Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can have exit strategies, why not Cornwall or Yorkshire – or England? The government’s lack of trust in English localism is pathological. A number of hesitant conclusions can already be drawn from the statistics. The virus is highly infectious and sensible distancing seems to mitigate its spread. But national excess deaths above the seasonal average seem largely to relate to demographics, such as age balance, population dispersal and urbanisation. Except in a few atypical cases, widely differing suppression policies have not been reflected in mortality rates.
This virus appears to have peaked in the first week of April, arguably before the full impact of the cabinet’s lockdown can have been felt. Now Johnson – who previously supported mitigation, not suppression – demands that we honour “past efforts and sacrifices”. This is meaningless if he continues with a questionable policy, against the certainty of the toll he is taking on British lives and livelihoods for years to come. Britons must listen in agony as leaders in Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Brussels and Rome articulate their routes out of this mess. Johnson and his colleagues have articulated nothing. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-27 12:31:20+00:00,99011,67
99032,commentisfree/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-sage-scientific-groupthink,Opinion,Coronavirus can only be beaten if groups such as Sage are transparent and accountable | Richard Coker,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-sage-scientific-groupthink,"Earlier this month in the Guardian, the Lancet editor, Richard Horton, suggested that “coronavirus is the greatest global science policy failure in a generation”. He recalled the many experts who have been predicting such a pandemic, some for decades, and argued that in the UK, “the experts – scientists who have modelled and simulated our possible futures – made assumptions that turned out to be mistaken.” If he is right, and I think he is, then we should ask, why? I’ve been researching the control of infectious diseases for 30 years, and I believe that an earlier debacle – one perhaps forgotten by many – offers insights. In 1976, fearful that an outbreak of swine influenza at Fort Dix army camp in New Jersey was the centre of an influenza pandemic on a scale potentially similar to the 1918 Spanish flu, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised President Gerald Ford of the urgent need for a mass immunisation programme.
The similarity between this swine influenza and the 1918 pandemic was overstated. But in the meantime, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. And the vaccine was associated with cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, some fatal. In the immediate aftermath, the affair was seen as a fiasco. In their remarkable study of the event, Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg set out the lessons learned. Their report, The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease, is unlike almost every other report I have ever read. It is a candid, unsanitised analysis that aims to determine the managerial errors made and draw lessons so that they would not be repeated. The report was commissioned by Joseph Califano, Ford’s secretary of health, education and welfare: “Lessons were what he wanted,” wrote the report’s authors, “not a history; finger-pointing did not interest him in terms of last time; his concern was with next time.” What lessons from that report should we reflect on now? Two, I think, are especially important. First, we should be cautious that experts may be overconfident in theories that are “spun from meagre evidence”. Second, we should question “scientific logic and implementation prospects”. The key issue the authors identified was that groupthink led to misjudgments of the evidence, and failed to question assumptions; and voices that opposed were silenced, excluded or denied entry. “Collegial relations” in key advisory committees were too close, many members worked “with mutual confidence”. They “would talk it out together before writing memoranda to each other”. In a critical passage, the report states: “Panels tend toward ‘group think’ and over-selling, tendencies nurtured by long-standing interchanges and intimacy, as in the influenza fraternity. Other competent scientists, who do not share their group identity or vested interests, should be able to appraise the scientific logic applied to available evidence.” I know many of the current members of the UK’s key government committees. The membership of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) is publicly available. The membership of the more important committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is responsible for scientific advice to the Cabinet Office briefing room, was revealed on Friday after a list was leaked. I like all the people I know on these committees. They are extremely bright. And I believe their values and motivations are “good”. But I worry that their intimacy, their familiarity, lends itself to groupthink. Are there sufficient contrarian views? Are critically important assumptions subjected to sufficient critique? Is groupthink acknowledged as a risk, and if so, how is it addressed? The roles taken on by the members are enormously important. The decision-making process is challenging, but must be scrutinised. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and self-identified member of Sage, has talked of receiving personal abuse because of his position on Sage. But the deliberations and minutes and, in my view, the academic disciplines of the members should be made public, if not members’ names. Transparency and scrutiny are critically important if groupthink is to be avoided. The revelation that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s adviser, has been attending Sage meetings, adds urgency to this demand.
Without this, the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the committee and its members will continue to be regarded as suspect. When political influence is added to groupthink among scientists – should it have occurred – then the result can only be a diminution of the committee’s authority and the advice it gives. In their report, Neustadt and Fineberg wrote: “Policy decisions regarding influenza rest on judgments about the behaviour of the virus, the impact of the disease and our ability to interdict its course. But the virus is capricious, the disease elusive, and our remedies imperfect.” All of us involved in attempting to control Covid-19, which means all of us, should reflect with humility, embrace those who challenge our assumptions, and draw on these lessons. • Richard Coker is emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine",2020-04-27 10:51:46+00:00,99033,2
99057,commentisfree/2020/apr/27/lockdown-scepticism-culture-war-brexit,Opinion,Boris Johnson's lockdown is the latest target for the right's angry culture warriors | Rachel Shabi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/lockdown-scepticism-culture-war-brexit,"For weeks we have heard that merely asking questions about the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak is “politicising the crisis”. But now some people on the right are indeed making the pandemic political – firing up the culture wars forged in what now feels like the prehistoric age of Brexit. Luminaries of the leave campaign have jacked up familiar themes to revive a well-worn narrative: of patriotic ordinary people set against “whingeocrat” metropolitan elites and woke leftists who hate Britain. In the coronavirus edition of the culture wars, critics of the government’s slow, muddled response to the pandemic – who may overlap with the remainers of old – are cast as gleeful about Britain’s horrifying death toll, since it presents an opportunity to bash both the Conservatives and the conceits of exceptionalism. Complaints that coverage of Boris Johnson’s own illness overshadowed a nightmarish week of deaths and national suffering are scorned for failing to understand the public’s love for the prime minister. And damning revelations about the government’s lack of preparedness for when the pandemic struck are breezily dismissed. People will forgive Johnson anything, his cheerleaders insist, while critics – “remainer losers” – are foolishly obsessed with his misdemeanours. But the key issue in the right’s current culture war is the lockdown, which is being presented as a freedom-sucking con – much like the EU. Mirroring the dynamics of climate denialism, those challenging the overwhelming consensus of global expertise cast themselves as lockdown “sceptics”. And cleaving to a rightwing populist script, these sceptics say their legitimate concerns are being silenced. Writing in the Spectator, Lionel Shriver notes that no TV platform is offered to those outside the 89% who support the lockdown. The sceptics claim to be speaking truth to the overly frightened masses, explaining that a costly lockdown is more deadly in the long term and urging that we reassess priorities. As Toby Young put it: “Spending £350bn to prolong the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money.” Failing the most basic moral test of any society worthy of the description, lockdown sceptics say that a recession may be more deadly than the pandemic, an idea already dismissed as nonsense. Strikingly, these sceptics don’t engage with the actual issue with the lockdown: that it came too late, causing thousands of unnecessary deaths, even while many scientists and the World Health Organization were imploring swifter action of the like being taken by other countries. Swerving this debate, the culture-war narrative is, as ever, a rhetorical smokescreen, deflecting substantive arguments. And just as Brexit was a delivery mechanism for hard-right ideas, lockdown scepticism is about promoting an ideological agenda. Tellingly, the Critic, a rightwing magazine, views the divide as “the ever-lockers vs the liberators”. But who even wants to stay in lockdown? Most would prefer release to come as soon as possible. Scientists signal that a test-and-trace strategy is the best way out, yet you don’t hear lockdown sceptics protest that the paucity of Covid-19 testing is obstructing their fundamental freedoms. What’s really being contested is the kind of society that will emerge once this is over. And you can see why Brexit populists and big-state haters are worried. When Rishi Sunak unveiled an unprecedented economic bailout last month, one rightwing commentator told me it was infuriating: if the government could so easily pump money into society, how would the right ever again argue against state funding? And while the realities of lockdown vary considerably according to factors such as wealth, class, gender and race, some elements of it have been experienced as positive. Recent polling suggests only 9% of the population wants a post-lockdown return to how things were before: we’re enjoying the cleaner air, sightings of wildlife, stronger community and increased time to connect with some friends and family. Already in Italy, Milan is attempting to emerge from lockdown into a city with less pollution by announcing an ambitious scheme to reduce the number of cars on its roads. According to one of the city’s deputy mayors: “Of course we want to reopen the economy, but we think we should do it on a different basis from before. We think we have to reimagine Milan in the new situation.” Lockdown sceptics commonly reject the green policies proposed by climate campaigners, but the recent closures have unleashed an appetite for them. Despite speculation over the influence of sceptics within government, the prime minister is reportedly cautious over rushing to loosen the current isolation measures. But the hallmarks of lockdown scepticism can be seen in the government’s go-it-alone rejection of the EU’s bulk-buying scheme for essential equipment, and in its initial pursuit of “herd immunity”. Their power in the press and in the heart of government signals the battles we will face over the shape of our future society – and shows how existing divisions may be manipulated for political advantage. The sceptics are currently out of sync with public opinion. But as we know from painful experience, we can’t assume this will always be the case.

99087,commentisfree/2020/apr/27/public-inquiry-coronavirus,Opinion,"If 'now is not the time' to commit to a coronavirus inquiry, then when? | Nesrine Malik",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/public-inquiry-coronavirus,"As calls mount for an inquiry into the government’s coronavirus response, the answer we hear is: now is not the time. When Dominic Raab was asked last week if the government would commit to holding a public inquiry, he resorted to the impatient language of priorities. “When we get through this crisis,” he huffed, only then will it be “important to take stock”. Here’s what we already know. The government delayed implementing a lockdown for no clear reason – perhaps it was the prime minister’s outsized regard for the “freedom-loving instincts of the British people”, or a misguided bid to pursue “herd immunity” – and then reversed its position. Weeks were wasted, and thousands of lives were lost. The government abruptly stopped its contact-tracing programme in mid-March; it claimed mass testing wasn’t necessary, and then U-turned while repeatedly shifting the goalposts on the number of tests to be done. It did not provide adequate levels of PPE for NHS and care home staff, and hundreds of workers are dying. This government’s Conservative predecessors underfunded the NHS and undermined the UK’s preparedness for a major crisis such as a pandemic.
These are the facts. But this moment is a reminder that facts do not speak for themselves. Because here’s another fact: the government is immensely popular. Even as new polls hint at growing concern over specific aspects of the response – with a majority now critical of the government’s handling of testing – there is still widespread approval of the government’s overall handling of the crisis. There’s no point sneering at these numbers: governments around the world have seen a rise in their ratings, as the view that “we’re all in it together” rallies populations behind their leaders. Especially when we are actually physically all in it together, locked down and bereaved. Here, of course, even the prime minister has not been spared by the virus – and the image of an ailing leader, overworking himself into intensive care, might alone soften calls for an inquiry into his government’s failings. Should we expect more outrage than we have seen so far? The UK death toll, which looks likely to end up as the highest in Europe, does not equally affect all sections of society, and it hasn’t spread evenly across the country. Obviously anyone can catch the virus, but there are disparities of race, class and geography. For some, these deaths are still distant statistics: a YouGov poll conducted last week reported that 41% of respondents said that they were not scared of contracting the virus. Separately, there is a reluctance to “shout at the pilot in mid-air” – a form of deference that will ensure that as long as the plane is still in the air, the government’s ratings will also continue to defy gravity, no matter how poorly its flight path was chosen. And it doesn’t hurt the pilot’s cause that much of the in-flight entertainment is dedicated to repeating his team’s claims about how well they’re doing. For all that the facts look damning for the government, the overall picture presented to the public has not been notable for its scrutiny and scepticism. This is not a swipe at an amorphous “media” failing to hold the government to account. Many journalists are probing and investigating – and getting flak for doing so. But much of the press has either stenographically taken the government’s word for things, or relegated the awkward matter of our appalling death toll to a mere footnote amid other concerns about life under lockdown. Last week, The Sun had a front-page splash that read “Lockdown blow. Pubs shut until Xmas”. On a small image of a Covid-19 virus splodge on the same page, it said “596 dead. See page 4”. Other papers, such as the Daily Telegraph, have effectively become mouthpieces for the government.
In the end, the facts alone will not determine how this government is judged. It is an axiom of liberal thinking that with enough debate and discussion, the truth will eventually win out – that in the marketplace of ideas, the truest arguments eventually prevail over the loudest or most popular. But there is no discourse that is immune to the workings of power. And for now, this is still a powerful government: from the size of its majority to the circulation of its loyal partisan press. It has been the beneficiary of a stilted press briefing format that prevents follow-up questions, and it had the good luck to face a defeated opposition leader whose criticism of the government was largely ignored. The new occupant of that chair, Keir Starmer, has had a good start on challenging the government for its technical failures. But he has also succumbed to the faulty premise that “now is not the time” – resisting calls for an independent inquiry because the “priority” is that the government “fixes the current mistakes it is making”. As the picture of who is going to take the blame starts to come into focus, the question is not simply how to secure a future inquiry. If we do not prepare the ground for it now, we will find that by the time the moment for “taking stock” finally arrives, there will be little appetite for real accountability. When it’s all over, we will hear that there’s no point in fixing blame; instead we will “learn lessons” for the future. This is the problem with “now is not the time”; it ensures that the time for accountability will never arrive. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-27 06:00:35+00:00,99088,2
99106,commentisfree/2020/apr/27/lest-we-forget-a-pandemic-isnt-a-war-but-our-healthcare-workers-are-heroes,Opinion,Lest we forget: a pandemic isn't a war but our healthcare workers are heroes | Clare Wright,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/lest-we-forget-a-pandemic-isnt-a-war-but-our-healthcare-workers-are-heroes,"Often during this global health pandemic doctors and nurses have been invoked as heroes on the frontline, as Covid-19 is compared by political leaders to a war. On Anzac Day the prime minister, Scott Morrison, singled out Brisbane ICU nurse Carolyn Griffiths, who joined the Reserves after the 2002 Bali bombings and served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and is now working at Princess Alexandra hospital. He spoke about Afghanistan veteran and brain cancer survivor Corporal Matt Williams, who is now in lockdown because of coronavirus. “He has served us, but now we must do the right thing by him and so many more because we are all in this together. But we always have been and we always will be,” he said.
American psychologist Abraham Maslow noted in 1966, “It is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” Similarly, it is seemingly irresistible, if the only hero you have is a soldier, to treat everything as if it were a war. Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump has excelled in using the (xenophobic) nationalist rhetoric of combat. He calls Covid-19 “a cruel virus from a distant land”, inflicted on the innocent American public which is now engaged in a “historic battle against the invisible enemy”. Only a “shared national sacrifice”, rallies Trump, “will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory”. But no matter how many times politicians and journalists use military metaphors to describe the effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the fact remains that any such battle has not been waged by soldiers, but by healthcare workers. The co-ordinated effort to save lives is not the same as the state-sanctioned battle to extinguish them. For one thing, doctors, nurses, paramedics, orderlies, medical receptionists and ambos did not enlist to go to the front. Neither, for that matter, did the teachers, aged care and childcare workers whose services have been conveniently branded essential despite decades of paying them as if they were industrially irrelevant. Healthcare workers did not volunteer to wear sub-standard uniforms (one doctor I know has been donning meat processing gowns for lack of PPE) and be armed with under-powered machinery in hostile terrain (the same doctor administered hundreds of flu vaccinations to Indigenous Victorians in a bayside car park for lack of safe facilities). They did not expect their own families to be in the firing line of infection. The front is not “over there” – as the first world war recruitment posters made clear, with a young soldier looking to the horizon, erect weapon in hand — but right here, in our emergency rooms and nursing homes.
And the most obvious distinction between army personnel and healthcare workers is that the vast majority of the latter are female. As Melinda Gates pointed out in a widely reported interview during World Health Worker Week (who knew?), more than 70% of the global health workforce are women. Frontline Health Workers Coalition, a US-based advocacy group calling for immediate policy changes and investment in the frontline health capacity of middle- to low-income countries, argues that women’s “action, their passion and their dedication to their practice often can be the difference between life and death for millions of people around the world every day.” As the British prime minister famously discovered. “I can’t thank them enough, I owe them my life,” said Boris Johnson. Over three quarters of all NHS staff are female. Concentrated in the lower (yet no less critical) pay bands, a significant proportion are women of colour. The gendered nature of leadership also differs in war and peacetime emergency response. Military command is based on hierarchy, deference and conformity. The structure of the pandemic response has required more fluid, more collaborative strategies, focussing on communication rather than control. Notable among the Covid-19 leadership have been Professor Sharon Lewin, the director of the Peter Doherty Institute, and NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant. Healthcare workers, researchers and administrators should emerge from this era-defining crisis as national heroes. But will they? The signs are not good. Instead of being cheered from balconies as they travel to work in their uniforms, as they are in some countries, Australian nurses are being spat on, vilified and harassed. And as Professor Kim Rubenstein and Trish Bergin of the 50/50 by 2030 Foundation have noted, the public face of the Australian government’s Covid-19 response — “the national voice of authority” — is largely male, despite the depth of female expertise and ability in the field. Which begs the question: how will we remember the courage, duty and sacrifice of the army of Covid-19’s frontline workers when the world is well again? Can we pivot away from militarist memorialisation to commemorate care? Will our nurses, teachers and carers be revered like Anzacs when the history of 2020 comes to be written? My hope is that on hearing the words sacrifice and service, we will automatically think of the brave women (and men) who have protected, healed and safeguarded us so well through a national crisis. And then, on behalf of a grateful nation, we start to reward them with the decent, honest wages and working conditions they deserve. For our heroes don’t just belong to the past, they live with us today. Clare Wright is professor of history at La Trobe University.

99252,commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik,Opinion,"We're desperate for a coronavirus cure, but at what cost to the human guinea pigs? | Kenan Malik",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik,"Last week, in Oxford, the first volunteers in the first European human trial were injected with a potential coronavirus vaccine. At the same time, Pakistan’s National Institute of Health received an offer from the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm International Corp to take part in a trial of another potential coronavirus vaccine.
The two events reveal twin aspects of the global process of drug trials and development. On the one hand, there is the ingenuity and drive that allow a potential vaccine to emerge in a fraction of the time it would normally take, as well as the courage and selflessness shown by the volunteers risking their health to test it. On the other, the increasing use of poorer nations as testing grounds for new medicines, in trials in which the subjects often have, because of poverty and lack of access to health provision, little choice about whether to take part. The details of the proposed Chinese trial are still unclear, but it is part of what many call the “globalisation of clinical trials”. Until the end of the last century, virtually all clinical trials by western pharmaceutical companies were conducted in Europe or America. The majority still are. But over the past 20 years, US, European and, increasingly, Chinese companies have taken to offshoring trials to low- and middle-income countries. In 2017, 90% of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency were tested at least in part outside the US and Canada. At a time when so much attention -and hope - is focused on the possibilities of a Covid-19 vaccine, it’s worth reminding ourselves of what the development of medicines means for most of the world. The reasons for conducting tests offshore are not hard to discern. In lower income countries, regulation is looser, staff cheaper and subjects easier to find, cutting costs by 30-40%. Take India. It has a huge population, enormous levels of poverty, almost 20% of the global disease burden and a pitiable health infrastructure. It also has highly trained scientists and medics, skilled technicians and good laboratories. As a result, in the first decade of this century, India became the poor country of choice for many pharmaceutical companies. The proportion of global clinical trials conducted in India rose from less than 1% in 2008 to 5% six years later – just about on par with the UK. The globalisation of clinical research has many potential benefits. It could help tackle diseases long ignored, develop medical and scientific innovation in non-western countries, improve their health infrastructure and increase the diversity of trial subjects and thereby the quality of the final product. In reality, too little of this has happened because offshore clinical trials have at their heart not a concern for the welfare of subjects or the health of local populations but the need to cut costs and generate profits.
Ethical guidelines for clinical research normally require participating patients to have access to the best available treatments for their condition. But in poor countries, the fact that people are poor has often been an excuse for researchers brushing aside such considerations. A particularly egregious case was in the treatment of HIV in the 1990s. The standard care at that time to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV was a course of the drug AZT. The drug was expensive, so researchers wanted to see if other treatments might work. In the west, the control group in such trials would have received the normal course of AZT. In a series of trials in Africa and Asia, however, the control group received not AZT but a placebo, on the grounds that poor people would normally not have received treatment anyway. Hundreds of babies were born infected with Aids when they might have been free of the virus. As Sonia Shah wrote in her book The Body Hunters: “Rather than working to overcome the inevitable barriers of poverty and inequity, many Aids researchers felt compelled to accommodate them.” Too often, that remains the case. In India, many poor people were recruited to trials without knowing that they were taking part in experiments. Thousands died, though as no proper records were kept the true figure is unknown. Government data indicate 2,868 deaths between 2005 and 2012 and a further 2,209 between 2013 and 2015; others suggest the total might be much higher. The scandals, court rulings and parliamentary scrutiny led to a tightening of regulations. This in turn led to pharmaceutical companies pulling out of India, forcing the government to loosen regulations once more. Equally troubling is that clinical trials in poor countries rarely address local health problems. Every year, infectious diseases take a devastating toll in India: 440,000 people die annually from TB. To put that in perspective, more than 190,000 people have died globally so far from Covid-19. Yet just 0.7% of clinical trials in India target TB. Among children, the biggest killers are diarrhoeal diseases; fewer than 1% of trials concern gastrointestinal infections. More than 12% of Indian clinical trials are, on the other hand, designed to find cures for cancer. That’s half as many again as the total number of trials targeting all infectious diseases. Indeed, there are more trials in India investigating skin problems, including for the development of cosmetics, than for infectious diseases. Cancers and skin problems are important to tackle, but these are conditions that more afflict rich nations – and the rich in India. The issues that primarily affect the poor still remain largely ignored. Globally, diseases of relevance to high-income countries are investigated in clinical trials seven to eight times more often than diseases whose burden lies mainly in low- and middle-income countries. There is little profit in tackling TB or diarrhoea. There are large bounties in cures for cancers or improvements in cosmetics. And so the bodies of the wretchedly poor become exploited to alleviate the ailments of the comfortably rich. This year or next, we will, it’s hoped, find a vaccine for Covid-19. Once the pandemic is brought to an end, there will still be millions in the global south dying for want of basic medicines and research. Will we take their lives as seriously as we are taking the lives of those devastated by coronavirus? Will we rethink the way that clinical research is conducted and what its priorities should be? Or will we continue to ignore the poor and persist in allowing profit to take precedence over people? • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",2020-04-26 07:00:07+00:00,99253,2
99324,commentisfree/2020/apr/25/social-media-no-longer-tolerates-toxic-lies-dont-believe-a-word-of-it,Opinion,Social media no longer tolerates toxic lies? Don't believe a word of it,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/25/social-media-no-longer-tolerates-toxic-lies-dont-believe-a-word-of-it,"The tech companies insist that the corona pandemic of 2020 will not be a repeat of the US presidential election of 2016. With millions of lives at stake, economies collapsing and hunger spreading, they will not rake in the advertising revenue generated by fake news and Russian disinformation this time round. They are responsible corporate citizens. Or so they wish us to believe. Early in the lockdown, YouTube and Facebook made a great fuss about removing a David Icke video in which he claimed the coronavirus wasn’t a virus but a sinister sickness spread by 5G networks. Asked about attacks on phone masts by his confederates in duncery, Icke didn’t fall over himself to condemn them. “If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision.” Facebook said it was “committed to removing misinformation which could contribute to physical harm” as it took down the interview with Icke and the London Real conspiracist site. (There’s little real about it, I should add.) YouTube said it had no truck with “conspiracy theories” and did the same. They weren’t serious. If they had been, they would have banned Icke and his imitators. As it was, Facebook and YouTube did not say they could no longer tolerate Icke on their platforms. They gave him the aura of being a free speech martyr by removing one interview, which he gratefully exploited, then allowed him to carry on as before. At the time of writing, close to 500,000 had watched a recent Icke video entitled “Is There a Virus?” that YouTube had not taken down. Icke’s jowls bubble with suppressed fury. “They” were “redesignating” deaths from flu and from 5G waves as deaths from Covid-19, he explains. And why would “they” go to the time and trouble of doing that? Because “they” want to “destroy independent income” and impose a “massive fascistic global Orwellian control of the population”.
The far left and alt-right cannot put forward a conspiracy theory without hitting on Jews. The legacies of religious, fascist and communist antisemitism are invisible forces propelling them forward to the irresistible conclusion that only one people had the occult power to fool and impoverish the whole wide world without anyone except the wised-up Icke and his kind noticing. Who are his “they”? Where can we find “them”? They are the 1%, Icke explains. Specifically, an “ultra-Zionist billionaire”. I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp. I can’t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, the far-right fop Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure. Twitter banned him in for leading a pile-on against a black actress, and its censorship finished him off. If Facebook and YouTube were to ban the corona conspiracists, that would be censorship too, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise.
Alongside the pretence that censorship is not censorship is a hyperinflation in the notion of what speech should be punished for causing harm. The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed “liberals” have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their “hate speech” laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent. Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have physically attacked phone masts. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King’s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose a physical risk to public health. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring. They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom sanctioned a tiny TV station called London Live because it broadcast Icke “casting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus”. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale. Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech. But they have no obligation to help turn their countries into morgues. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",2020-04-25 17:30:51+00:00,99325,2
99399,commentisfree/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-exposed-china-history-racism-africans-guangzhou,Opinion,The coronavirus crisis has exposed China's long history of racism | Hsiao-Hung Pai,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-exposed-china-history-racism-africans-guangzhou,"“Clean up the foreign trash!”. “Don’t turn our hometown into an international rubbish dump.” “This is China, not Nigeria!” Resembling the anti-migrant racist hatred you frequently see on UK social media, these are just a few examples of countless anti-African rants from Weibo users in China in a surge of popular racism over the past month. Despite the huge amount of censorship on China’s social media, none of these posts have been removed. Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa have become the primary target of suspicion, racial discrimination and abuse amid public fear of a second wave of Covid-19. And this intolerance has peaked in Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people in the highly industrialised Guangdong province. It started with the local government in Guangzhou implementing surveillance, conducting compulsory testing and enforcing a 14-day quarantine for all African nationals – even if they had earlier been tested negative and hadn’t recently travelled outside China. In Yuexiu district, the largest African migrant community in China, many Africans were evicted by landlords – despite having paid their rents – and left to sleep rough on the streets.
In an echo of apartheid South Africa or segregation-era United States, a colour bar was imposed across the city: Africans were refused entry by hospitals, hotels, supermarkets, shops and food outlets. At one hospital, even a pregnant woman was denied access. In a department store, an African woman was stopped at the entrance while her white friend was allowed in. In a McDonald’s restaurant, a notice was put up saying “black people cannot come in”. The widespread racism has caused a huge public outcry across Africa, shared on social media under the hashtag #ChinaMustExplain. YouTuber Wode Maya, who has lived in China and is a fluent Mandarin speaker, urges fellow Africans to “wake up to what’s happening”. The global African diaspora has put pressure on African embassies and institutions to act. Last weekend the Kenyan government announced plans to allow its citizens stranded in China to be evacuated. The official Chinese responses were at first silence or denial. State media such as Global Times and Xinhua failed to report the story in the first few days after the news broke in African news outlets. Later, the Chinese authorities began to recognise the reports of racism as “reasonable concerns”, though migrants continue to feel unsafe. To outsiders, this horrendous racism may appear “unprecedented”. But ethnic minorities in China would find it all too familiar. In Shaoguan, not far from Guangzhou, the racist murder of two Uighur workers in 2009 triggered a series of events, such as the Ürümqi Incident, which led to further repression in the north-western region of Xinjiang. The ideology of “race” in China goes back a long way. In the late 19th century, Qing imperial reformers searched for an “answer” that could revive China in face of European and Japanese colonialist expansion. “Race”, “nation” and nationalism have since been embedded into Chinese republicanism in the early 20th century, and then into the establishment of the Chinese Communist party.
Nationalism has taken deeper root in the four decades since Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms. National revival has been a key ideological driver behind modernisation. Today, assimilationism is at the centre of the concept of nation. Minzu, a key term used interchangeably for both ethnic group and nationality, refers to a group of common descent, with a distinct culture and territory. In 2012, Xi Jinping began his rule by saying: “The China dream gathers Chinese aspirations and wishes for generations and manifests the interests of the whole Chinese nation (zhonghua minzu) …” The “China dream” became the political-economic programme for “the realisation of the great revival of the Chinese nation”. This century is the “Chinese century”, Xi said. His multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative was launched in 2013 as a massive global investment programme. From 2013 to 2018, the Chinese state invested nearly $614bnin developing countries. China’s foreign investment campaign is seen by some in Africa as colonialism, as the nations involved risk losing control of their essential infrastructure and natural resources, with their debt burden increased. China now holds 14% of the total debt stock in sub-Saharan Africa and has become the largest owner of public debt in Africa. China’s growing presence brought with it labour migration from African countries from the late 1990s. People from Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and other west African countries came for work opportunities, mostly in the metropolis of Guangzhou. Many work in the city’s wholesale markets as other types of employment, including factory work, are closed to them. It’s commonly said by them that Africans are often “accepted as traders but discriminated against as people”. There are currently more than 15,000 African migrants with formal immigration status living in Guangzhou. Although China has the lowest immigration in the world (migrants account for just 0.07% of the population), the authorities impose harsh “migrant management”. African migrants can often be criminalised in a similar way to the internal migrants from the countryside. Apart from immigration checks and crackdowns, the authorities consistently discourage migrants from living in certain neighbourhoods. There is no legal protection against racial discrimination. The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted this longstanding anti-African racism. With all the damage this pandemic has done to the economy and people’s livelihoods, scapegoating and hostility towards an imagined outside threat clearly helps to divert domestic frustration away from the ruling elite – a trend we are all seeing worldwide. As Asian communities in Europe and the United States become victims of racism during this pandemic, Africans in China are crying out, “We are not the virus!” To resist racism, we need to see it for what it is, wherever it occurs. • Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and the author of Scattered Sand: The Story of China’s Rural Migrants",2020-04-25 08:00:40+00:00,99400,2
99508,commentisfree/2020/apr/24/lockdown-time-coronavirus-prisoners,Opinion,Adjust your clocks: lockdown is bending time completely out of shape | Jonathan Freedland,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/lockdown-time-coronavirus-prisoners,"It was a long March, perhaps the longest any of us can remember. And yet April is on course to be if not the cruellest month, then unexpectedly the shortest. Strictly speaking, none of that makes sense. There were 31 days in March, as always, and there will be 30 in April, as always. And yet, coronavirus has not just upended space, reshaping the landscape around us so that once-crammed city centres now lie empty and deserted – it has also messed with time. Tell people that Monday will mark the start of week six of lockdown and they stare back in disbelief. Really? How did that happen? “The weeks seem to pass surprisingly quickly,” texts one friend. “Yet the days seem to last an eternity.” Strange things are happening with time, and stranger things could happen still. When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown on 23 March, the talk – the hopeful assumption – was that it would last three weeks. A review was scheduled. But the date for that came and went, and people began to adjust to the idea that maybe this would stretch deep into the summer. And then on Wednesday, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, warned that “highly disruptive” social distancing measures were likely to be in place until 2021. That is a very different prospect, and it requires us to adjust our clocks. The sober, uber-rational health correspondent of the New York Times, Donald McNeil, suggests an easing by the end of the year is optimistic, given how long it will take to produce either a vaccine or effective treatment for Covid-19. He spoke of how he is expecting a grandchild in June – and is coming to terms with the possibility that he might not meet that child until he or she is two years old. For everyone, this is a challenge of a different order. A sustained, long-run lockdown means that a vast stretch of undifferentiated time is unfurling ahead of us, stripped bare of the usual divisions and markers. We are facing a form of confinement that will not be brief. Tentatively, I called up Erwin James, who served 20 years of a life sentence for murder and for several years wrote a column for the Guardian called A Life Inside. I say tentatively because I wasn’t sure a former prisoner would have much patience for comparisons between the kind of lockdown we are enduring – in our own homes, sometimes with a garden, often with family, permitted to go to the shops or the park – and the incarceration that he experienced. And yet, if anyone knows about the tricks restriction can play with time, it’s a former inmate. It turns out I needn’t have hesitated. “There are so many resonances with prison,” James tells me. So much so that the letters page of the paper he edits for prisoners and detainees – called, fittingly enough, Inside Time – has been filled with little else. Any inmate would identify with the unnerving paradox my friend had spoken about, James says. “The days drag and then you wake up and a month has passed and you think, ‘Where the hell has that gone?’” At the heart of the matter is the Groundhog Day sameness. When one day is no different from the next, time becomes thick and amorphous, hard to keep hold of. “It’s like walking through treacle, in slow motion,” says James. In the words of Victor Serge, the serially jailed Russian revolutionary, “There are swift hours and very long seconds.” To break up the monotony, prisoners hunger for milestones, especially seasonal ones. They longed, James recalls, for the sight of pied wagtails by the cell window or greenery on the trees, proof that spring had come. They looked forward to the Boat Race or the Grand National or the May bank holiday or Wimbledon, anything that might separate one period of time from another. James remembers how his fellow prisoners would go wild on New Year’s Eve – banging bean cans, tins, fists, even heads against the doors in celebration – only for there to be a lull a half-hour later, as those inside realised that although one year had gone, another stretched ahead, that there was “another mountain to climb”. Again, lockdown is not the same as prison or even house arrest. But James insists that “it has given people a flavour of what it’s like to have your choices limited”. That need for milestones, for example. Those currently missing the football are not only craving the delight of watching 22 men kick a ball about. It’s also the delineation of the week that a fixture list can provide. Right now our lives resemble an unpunctuated sentence, shapeless and confusing. “No wonder people worldwide have immediately conceived a new communal ritual, the ovations for health workers,” writes the FT’s Simon Kuper. “We probably do this more for ourselves than for them.” The religious calendar can help, for those who find it meaningful. Muslims will find the coming weeks distinguished from the rest by Ramadan, just as Passover ensured eight days in April were unlike the rest for Jews. Others find themselves noticing nature in a way they did not before. After Whitty’s warning, I wondered about a winter lockdown – whether that would be much harder to bear than days that can be spent at least partially outside. Not at all, says James: “Time is easier in winter, because the days are shorter. Winter is much quicker than summer.” We can understand why those in prison would feel like that: wishing the days away, desperate to strike weeks off the calendar until the moment they are free and time becomes their own once more. Maybe some of us are already feeling that way about lockdown. But it comes with a great feeling of loss. We want to feel time is precious; we don’t want to write it off.

99532,commentisfree/2020/apr/24/gp-covid-patients-doctors-coronavirus,Opinion,We GPs don't want people with non-Covid health problems to suffer in silence | Ann Robinson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/gp-covid-patients-doctors-coronavirus,"Will the current Covid-19 crisis be the deluge before the storm? Are people storing up other health problems for fear of overwhelming the NHS or catching the virus themselves? Some doctors have expressed concern that A&E departments are almost too quiet and calm. And my GP surgery is somewhat similar: we’re busy with calls, emails and video consultations but almost all of them are Covid-related. And therein lies a question: where is everything else? Normally, I see around 30 patients in a day. This will be a mix of acute infections (respiratory, throat, ear and urine), mental health problems (anxiety, depression, stress), chronic conditions (diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, arthritis), skin rashes, lumps and bumps. There will also be people with worrying new symptoms such as weakness, dizziness or bleeding from one orifice or another. In primary care, most problems that we see will get better on their own without any input from a doctor other than an explanation and reassurance. In fact, they often get better quicker if we hold back on medical intervention – most non-Covid-19 viral infections, such as coughs and colds, fall into this category. A second group of conditions won’t usually cause immediate danger but if left untreated, will cause harm. There are lots of bits of kit that can help with self- management: a blood pressure monitor for hypertension, blood glucose monitors available from surgeries and pharmacists (or online), pulse oximeters to check oxygen levels for people with lung diseases and Tens machines for pain. Urine-testing strips are useful for identifying urine infections. If positive, your GP will be only too happy to prescribe an antibiotic without you having to take in a sample. A patient with diabetes told me that the combination of lockdown and difficulty getting food deliveries has proved an ideal opportunity for him to monitor and control his carbohydrate intake, resulting in the best blood sugar levels he’s had in years. A mum whose teenager has bad asthma said that having him captive has allowed her to check that he’s using his inhalers correctly, with a significant improvement in his coughing and wheezing. No one would wish this situation on any of us, but it has allowed these individuals and others to develop a self sufficiency that is empowering. The key is for people to report to the doctor if they don’t feel well. The third group of people that we see is the smallest in number, most urgent medically and most worryingly absent in this crisis: the middle-aged woman with chest pain that she thinks is indigestion but turns out to be a heart attack; the elderly man who lives on his own and keeps falling over, and urgently needs a pacemaker; the brief episode of slurred speech that could be a mini stroke; a heaviness in one breast that could be breast cancer; breathlessness and a cough that’s getting worse and needs a chest X-ray to check for lung cancer; a swelling in one calf after a period of immobility that could be a blood clot; the mole that has grown, changed colour and started crusting. In a typical week, I would see at least a few people in this last category. Now I am worried that in the past three weeks, non-Covid-19 problems seem to have vanished. I am less concerned that there may be a backlog of work for the NHS when we get back to normal – although that is a possibility. Self-sufficiency and resilience are fine qualities but there is no heroism in surviving the virus – or trying not to overburden NHS staff, only to succumb to other illnesses. GP surgeries and many primary care services are up and running, albeit in a modified form. Don’t simply stay away: if you have a health concern that you can’t solve, get in touch. • Ann Robinson is a GP",2020-04-24 13:59:41+00:00,99533,107
99636,commentisfree/2020/apr/24/year-nurse-tories-10-years-bad-care-nhs-crisis,Opinion,It's officially the year of the nurse – what better time to reverse 10 years of bad care? | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/year-nurse-tories-10-years-bad-care-nhs-crisis,"By a grim irony, this is the World Health Organization’s year of the nurse and the midwife – and so it has turned out to be, as the pandemic makes harsher demands on the profession than ever. The Health Service Journal’s latest analysis of deaths shows 106 dead: 35 nurses, 27 health care assistants, two midwives, 18 doctors and 10 in social care, along with others – and a high proportion from ethnic minorities. One nurse, at Witney Community hospital in Oxfordshire, was Margaret Tapley, who died of the virus while still in service at the age of 84. Before anyone gets carried away by Boris Johnson’s eulogy for his life-saving angels, the facts of nursing life are brutal and it’s worth recounting them in detail. In recent years, leavers have outnumbered joiners by up to 3,000 and the more nurses quit, the harder it becomes for those who stay in understaffed wards. Remember this epidemic began with the highest ever number of nurse vacancies: 44,000 in February. But, says Anne Marie Rafferty, the president of the Royal College of Nursing and professor of nursing policy at King’s College London, that’s not a true reflection: “Those vacancies run on affordability. That’s only the number of nurses they can pay for, not the number needed.” Even the 10,000 retired nurses who have returned to help out in the crisis, mostly not on the frontline, don’t cover those lost since 2010, she says.
Nurse training was an early casualty of George Osborne’s axe-swinging 2010 budget. Despite recent efforts, numbers are still down on 2010, though the decade saw a huge increase in patients, who are far sicker in a population with 25% more over-65s. After the 2016 cavalier removal of nursing bursaries, applicants fell by 24%: although the government has restored the £5,000 maintenance grants, fees at £9,000 a year are impossible for many healthcare assistants seeking to upgrade with families to support. The King’s Fund expects the nurse shortage to rise steeply to 100,000 over the next eight years. The UK has fewer nurses per head of the population than countries such as France, Denmark, Germany and Ireland – hence the growing tendency to substitute assistants for trained nurses. Any hope the government takes this seriously enough is blown away by the sheer insanity of charging non-EU medical staff £624 a year for each member of their family for their right to be treated by the health service they support. It looks like a deliberate policy to deter those we most need. Besides, nurses’ pay starts at £18,000, well below the high bar of £25,600 set for the right to work here. Brexit saw the departure of thousands of EU staff. This week a survey of 2,600 nurses by a group of universities and the RCN found an alarming state of anxiety, stress and fear about their own safety and their families’ and a lack of training before being plunged into new roles: a third of them reported severe depression. More than half worked longer than their contracted shifts, mostly unpaid, and only about half had the correct amount of personal protective equipment. During the austerity years nursing was seen as disposable, often first to be cut. Before this crisis wards were running hot, with a dangerous 95% or more beds filled. The ratio of nurses to very sick patients keeps rising, as does the average age of nurses, now at 47. The government talks breezily of more care in the community, getting people out of hospital beds faster, but that’s where the nurse shortage is gravest: district nurses have almost vanished, cut by 43% since 2010. Many have caseloads of 400, with just one for every 14,000 people in England – and nearly half are due to retire or leave in the next six years.
There is nothing insoluble about any of this. Encouraging and keeping nurses is not difficult. Pay them decently, give them as clear a career path ahead as doctors enjoy, and see what happens. As it is, the usual graduate premium for most occupations doesn’t apply to nurses’ meagre lifetime earnings. Housing for key workers would help. There used to be good accommodation for nurses, vital in high-cost areas, but the old nurses’ homes were sold off in one of Margaret Thatcher’s cost-cutting Rayner Scrutinies. Where nurses are treated as precious commodities and given maximum flexibility in their shift times, a few hospitals buck the trend and hold on to them, says Rafferty. As everyone reaches for some good to emerge from this catastrophe, she tells of a surgeon she just met, reassigned to an intensive care unit, “amazed” at the expertise of those specialist nurses – and humbled to find himself relegated to assisting. “But of course, they are still paid around a third of his salary,” she adds. So when next week’s clap for the NHS comes, join in out of gratitude but also out of anger – anger at how depleted the nursing workforce has become and how badly the successive Conservative governments have treated the profession. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-24 06:00:17+00:00,99637,16
99704,commentisfree/2020/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-lockdown-take-the-long-view,Opinion,The Guardian view on the Covid-19 lockdown: take the long view | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-lockdown-take-the-long-view,"Downing Street’s daily press briefings on the coronavirus crisis have been taking place for several weeks. The format is now grindingly familiar. One day’s briefing varies little from the next. The reluctance of ministers and officials to stray from the agreed line is insulting and has caused increasing impatience, particularly as evidence has mounted of the terrible planning, procurement and supply distribution failures by the UK government before and during the ongoing outbreak. That daily rhythm was briefly broken on Wednesday evening by the government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty. Departing from the usual cautious script in answer to a question, Prof Whitty made very clear that some of the government’s restrictive social measures are likely to remain in force until at least the end of 2020 and that it was “wholly unrealistic” to expect that life would return to normal soon. The Covid-19 virus was not going to disappear, so physical distancing and some lockdown measures were likely to continue for “really quite a long period of time”. Prof Whitty’s comments were important and sobering. They contained little precise detail, let alone dates, but, given the government’s self-imposed press briefing disciplines, they will not have been a piece of freelancing. It was, instead, a calculated intervention. The comments contained little that many people have not suspected for some time as they watch the continuing grim march of the virus. They nevertheless dashed any expectations that the lockdown will be largely eased or lifted when the current phase expires around 8 May. This was, in other words, a softening-up exercise as well as a reminder that an exit strategy from the lockdown is proving hard to devise, not least because of earlier failures to prepare. The manner and timing of the warning were important for at least three other reasons. The fact that Prof Whitty was chosen to deliver the sombre message means that ministers can continue to say they are deferring to the scientists, thus perhaps taking some of the pressure off the government for its mounting and increasingly serious list of policy failures. It also comes as, with the return of parliament, pressure mounts in parts of the Conservative party and elsewhere for the lockdown to be eased in early May in order to ease the pressures on business. Finally, it also meant that the UK government was able, by getting in first, to blunt some of the political impact of Thursday’s efforts by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to differentiate herself from the UK government approach by being more open about the need for restrictions to remain in place. The Scottish government’s paper on possible next steps is in fact broadly in line with Prof Whitty’s remarks. This reflects a reality, not always obvious from Ms Sturgeon’s adept press briefing performances, but attacked in a new report by the Scottish Centre on European Relations, that Covid-19 policy in Scotland continues to be broadly the same as in the UK as a whole. But the Scottish government paper is more truthful and proactive than its UK counterpart. It is therefore welcome, and not just in Scotland. The lifting of the lockdown, Ms Sturgeon makes clear, is likely to be phased and localised. There will be no return to the old normality for a long time, if at all. The reopening of schools, which many regard as an early priority for the sake of both children and their parents – and thus the economy – is likely to selective. Pubs and public events, likely to include sports, will be near the back of the queue. None of this will start soon, and there are no dates for any of it. The lockdown could be reimposed at short notice if virus cases spike upwards. This is the new reality that everyone is likely to have to face over the coming months. The effect on economic life is likely to be dire and long-lasting. And it will bear down most heavily on those who are least able to withstand either the material consequences or the disease itself. There can be little doubt now. We are in this for the long haul. It is time to be more honest about it.",2020-04-23 18:08:50+00:00,99705,67

Missing from Mr Raab’s list was that health system capacities ought to be “in place to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact”. What divides these two approaches is the “science”, which is why claims of following it ring so empty. On one side we have those who believe that testing, tracing and the isolating of infected individuals is needed to defeat coronavirus. In this camp are public health experts such as Anthony Costello of University College London and Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary. They have facts on their side. South Korea registered its first 10 deaths of patients with Covid-19 by 25 February, and by following the WHO’s advice Seoul had suppressed the epidemic within 22 days. Prof Costello says that by the time the UK had recorded its first 10 deaths, by 13 March, the government had stopped all testing and contact-tracing in the community. How has that gone? South Korea sees 17 new cases daily, while the UK records 5,000. These numbers convinced the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who on Thursday outlined his “test, track and trace” strategy, which would start “as the new number of cases begins to fall”. On the other side are those who believed the UK ought to go it alone – with a response determined by mathematical models and control measures while waiting for the silver bullet of a vaccine. In this camp appeared to be Mr Raab, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and his deputy, Jenny Harries, who condescendingly claimed South Korea’s outbreak was atypical and akin to controlling that found in a single care home. Sir Patrick Vallance’s promotion of “some kind of herd immunity” put him, as chief scientific adviser, at odds with public health doctors. The evidence suggests that was also the case for Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, who has long been entranced by computational modelling “fast enough for epidemic ‘war games’”. Sir Patrick chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which last month warned that “if interventions that are perceived to be effective [in other countries] are not applied [in the UK]”, then this would increase “the risk of public concern”. Sage recommended “a clear explanation as to why expected interventions are not being implemented”. Yet there is no official word to explain clearly why the Republic of Ireland, which has followed WHO advice, reportedly records a death rate a third lower than that in Northern Ireland, which follows UK advice. Such are the delusions of national character that too many members of the government, from the prime minister down, suffer from. People are dying. It is time to give up on the fantasies of British exceptionalism. • This article was amended on 29 April 2020 to clarify that the death rate analysis for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland had been reported, and to provide a direct link to this report.",2020-04-23 18:07:44+00:00,99706,2
99842,commentisfree/2020/apr/23/europe-is-easing-coronavirus-lockdowns-the-uks-failures-have-never-been-so-stark,Opinion,"When Europe eases its coronavirus lockdowns, will the UK watch and learn? | Martin McKee",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/europe-is-easing-coronavirus-lockdowns-the-uks-failures-have-never-been-so-stark,"The lockdown is wreaking havoc with the economy, children are missing vital education, those with mental health problems or experiencing domestic abuse are suffering, and people in need of non-Covid-19 healthcare are not getting it. Though the cabinet seems divided over the answer, the question is genuine: when will the UK exit the Covid-19 lockdown?
If the government has an exit strategy, it is keeping it closely guarded. As with so much about the government’s response, such as the identity of most members of its Covid-19 advisory group, information is released on a strictly need-to-know basis. What we do know is that the government will not set a specific date. It is right not to do so. Donald Trump may believe he is battling a germ that is “brilliant”, a characteristic not normally associated with a microscopic clump of genetic material, but even he abandoned his initial goal of opening up the US by Easter. This “very smart” virus does not observe religious festivals or read his tweets. The seeming unwillingness of the British government to share its thinking with the public contrasts starkly with the approach taken elsewhere. The European Union has published a roadmap that lays out a phased approach for containing the virus. Cynics might be forgiven for recalling the contrast between the EU’s detailed Brexit impact assessments and the superficial British ones, which had to be prised from the hands of ministers many months later. In the case of coronavirus, the UK would do well to follow the European roadmap, which recommends developing a robust system of contact tracing, expanding testing capacity and reinforcing PPE supplies as among the first steps towards lifting a lockdown. Other European countries have also set out their proposals in varying levels of detail. Angela Merkel gave an in-depth explanation of the scientific basis behind Germany’s lockdown strategy, drawing on a deep understanding of the epidemiology. In a speech marked by humility and acceptance that mistakes had been made, Emmanuel Macron explained that the process would be lengthy: schools would be opened when the data supported it, but restaurants and bars would remain closed for much longer. The countries that are most advanced in this process are those that closed down earliest, and thus managed to better contain the spread of the virus. This approach contrasts with that of the United Kingdom, which delayed its lockdown. Germany, which has attracted widespread praise for its ability to deliver widespread testing, is opening up smaller shops, as is Austria, although this is subject to customers distancing from each other and wearing face coverings. The Czech Republic, which like its neighbour Slovakia has strongly encouraged face coverings, is also opening small businesses. Denmark, meanwhile, is starting to open up elementary schools. These governments have made clear that continued progress is dependent on the course of the pandemic, and restrictions might well be reimposed – but they have been much more open with citizens about their respective approaches than the UK has been. The key elements that a British exit strategy must include are fairly obvious, providing, as the UK government keeps repeating, that these decisions are led by science. The science is clear. The only way to get back to anything like normality is to get what epidemiologists call the reproduction number, or R0, below 1. Put another way, we must find ways to ensure that those who are infected in a community pass that infection on to fewer than one other person. We can be certain this point is being made by England’s chief medical officer, an experienced infectious disease epidemiologist. But how can this be achieved? The EU’s document provides helpful guidance for what the UK’s strategy might look like. First, it should not even consider lifting restrictions until it has adequate data to be sure that the R0 really is below one. It can only do so if it has sufficient testing in place, for both the virus, determining who is infected, and the antibody, telling us who has been infected in the past and is therefore, hopefully, immune. This will require many more tests than the government’s current daily target of 100,000. At the same time, it will be important to show that the death rate really is falling, which will require far better data than is currently being provided, which has created considerable confusion about the number of deaths outside hospitals, especially in care homes. And the NHS must be ready for any resurgence once restrictions are lifted. This means having enough PPE, which is no more than an aspiration at present. Finally, the UK will need sufficient public health capacity to tackle resurgent infections, a task that will require enormous efforts to reverse the effects of a decade of cuts. Easing the lockdown will have to be accompanied by other measures to reduce transmission, such as continued physical distancing and, increasingly likely, face coverings, as in France, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Change must be gradual, with health authorities closely monitoring the effects. In Italy, regions are taking the first very hesitant steps at different speeds, while in Spain those in construction and manufacturing sectors who are now permitted to go back to work must maintain stringent precautions. Throughout this process, it will be essential to follow what other countries are doing. The approaches taken by various European countries offer a natural laboratory in which to test our own ideas. We must avoid simplistic comparisons, but also accept that the different approaches offer many learning opportunities. Unfortunately, some government advisers seem reluctant to take this opportunity. • Martin McKee is professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an adviser to the World Health Organization",2020-04-23 08:00:09+00:00,99843,2

The well-compensated stars of American professional basketball are subsidising the lost salaries of casual venue staff. In Scotland, cafes are making deliveries of free food packages to vulnerable and elderly people, while Melbourne restauranteurs are feeding frontline workers. The Italian tenor serenading his locked-down city of Florence singing Nessun Dorma and other opera classics from his balcony is glorious. So is the Spanish taxi driver taking coronavirus patients to the hospital for free. But amid the “kindness pandemic” and determined acts of caring, the times have provoked a simultaneous infection of self-absorption, pettiness and dangerous-foolerism. Sure, ordinary folks can make bad decisions in extraordinary times. But there are those who should know better who don’t do better, through sheer force of wilful shitheadedry. They should not be spared shaming. They should be given the recognition they richly deserve. So, without further ado: The 2020 awards for the very worst people of coronavirus so far …
WINNER, the Neville Chamberlain Award for Catastrophically Misreading the Situation: prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson On 3 March, British PM Boris Johnson bragged at his readiness to shake hands with local coronavirus patients. On 17 March, France locked down – and he suggested instead that coronavirus sufferers stay indoors a week and elderly Britons cancel holiday cruises. This strategy was “herd immunity” – ringfencing the most vulnerable of the population and allowing the disease to take its course. Without a vaccine, that means allowing masses of people to die. If you think that sounds like eugenics, your opinion is shared by the world’s leading specialists in infectious diseases.
It’s since been revealed Johnson missed five critical meetings in February that may have made him more aware of the strategic risk to his country, and himself – because by 27 March, Johnson himself had coronavirus, and British infections were following the tragic trajectory of Italy. As I write this, more than 18,000 people in the UK have died. I’m most relieved that Boris Johnson is not one of them. Had he perished, he would most earnestly deserved our sympathy. Now he’s on the mend, he can rightfully be served our scorn. WINNER, the Roger Stone Award for Thinking the Rules Don’t Apply to You: New Zealand health minister, David Clark Woeful behaviour is not entirely the preserve of one side of politics; health minister of New Zealand, Labour’s David Clark, broke his own government’s strict coronavirus lockdown rules on its first weekend. New Zealand Labour prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved quickly to a national shutdown early in the pandemic’s progression. Her strategy of virus “elimination” with rigorous stay-at-home regulation and widespread testing has been feted throughout the world; of today, 16 local coronavirus deaths are recorded. This has been made possible because the New Zealand citizenry complied with the draconian rules – rules Clark blithely ignored when he took his family on a car trip to the beach the first weekend of lockdown. He was separately photographed going for a lovely bike ride. Ardern swiftly demoted the minister, who made a grovelling public apology. It says much about her leadership that she resisted temptation to make a bicycle seat from his skin. WINNER, the Tiger Woods Award for Making Us Feel We Hardly Know You: Sweden Think Sweden, think Scandinavian social democracy; cradle-to-grave welfare and generous social support systems. But Sweden’s response to the pandemic has not been universal self-sacrifice, New Zealand-style. On the recommendation of an epidemiologist at the independent Public Health Agency, the Social Democrats/Greens coalition government have instead pursued a herd immunity strategy they’re calling a “trust-based” approach to the virus. Social distancing is voluntary. Schools for under-16s, gyms, restaurants, bars and Sweden’s borders remain open. As a result, it now has one of the highest proportional death rates from the virus in the world – nine times higher than next-door neighbour Finland, larger even than the United States. Since half of the country’s aged care facilities found themselves struck by coronavirus, Sweden has quietly started moving towards greater gathering restrictions. Like any apology, it doesn’t count for much when people have been left for dead. WINNER, the Donald Trump Award for Billionaire Shamelessness: Richard Branson This was a hotly contested category. As lockdowns, shutdowns and the illness itself have wiped out the economy-as-usual across the globe, individualist profiteers of the good times are suddenly collectivists in the misery. The old story of those who live to privatise the profits and socialise the losses really deserves a Netflix reboot – perhaps centred on a protagonist like Virgin billionaire Richard Branson. He’s holding thousands of ordinary people’s jobs hostage to demands that taxpayers refinance his failing business. In the reboot, let’s rewrite this story’s traditional ending to make sure taxpayers are repaid for their involuntary generosity with proportional ownership of these companies. Especially since Branson is demanding a bailout in his native Britain, where he has avoided paying personal income tax for 14 years. WINNER, the Abe Simpson Award for Yelling at Clouds: Sam Newman (and friends) Whether there could be any social identity more pathetic than that of a D-list Australian conservative is an outright no. Desperation for relevancy inspired a recent Twitter campaign demanding the extermination of bats. But the clear category winner was the faded “sports personality” who defied Australia’s (highly effective) lockdown, taking a one-man protest to the steps of the Victorian parliament, demanding his uninhibited human “right” to play golf.
A video provides so many things to enjoy. A MAGA-style hat! Eye-blinding trousers! Incomprehensible raving! Most of all, there’s rapture in seeing the animation of a cliche about privileged white male narcissism that didn’t a) require a cartoonist or b) involve someone getting hurt. The cumulative effect of the protest was to convince observers like myself that even if golf is at the safer end of activity, the ban should be maintained just to extend this man’s personal frustration. WINNER, the Walking Dead Award for Reminding Human Beings Our Greatest Threat is One Another: anti-lockdown protestors in the US From California to Michigan – and yet, coincidentally always in districts Republicans are heavily campaigning – anti-lockdown protests have bloomed across the US, drawing social-distance-defying crowds in the hundreds, sometimes even the tens. Egged on by the US president in impassioned ALL CAPS tweets, extraordinary photographs have appeared of “patriots” hanging out of cars screaming at the public-serving healthworkers who counterprotest in full PPE. Joshua Bickel’s photo of howling Ohio protestors pressed against glass doors deserves its own separate, serious, grown-up award for warning the world that it’s all getting a bit Shaun of the Dead in the US-of-A; one of the yawping mouths belongs to a Republican state Senate candidate. It would all be hilarious if states such as Michigan weren’t burying the coronavirus dead in their thousands. Supply shortages, the disaster of piecemeal, privatised healthcare and structural poverty have intersected with ill-prepared and incompetent presidential leadership, compounding the effects of coronavirus across America. After the coronavirus protests, Kentucky saw its largest spike in cases.
GRAND WINNER: President of the United States, Donald Trump Like Boris Johnson, he ignored international warnings about the coronavirus when meaningful action could have slowed its spread. He held public rallies even while experts begged for social distancing. He’s used press conferences to attack reporters, repeat lies and push treatments that some studies now suggest may be unproven cures at the same time he’s demanded praise. He’s promoted people who don’t know what they’re doing, allowed the demotion of others who desperately do, he’s abused leaders who’ve taken responsibility for their citizens, and adamantly taken none himself. He’s talked about his TV ratings while Americans were buried in mass graves. The only award in which he’s not competitive is one for failing to meet expectations – because nobody who’s watched Trump for five consistent minutes is surprised by this disaster at all. America outstrips the world for coronavirus infection. There have been more than 842,000 cases there. More than 46,000 Americans are dead. Donald, you blitzed this competition.

100100,commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus,Opinion,"Crunching the coronavirus curve is better than flattening it, as New Zealand is showing | Devi Sridhar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus,"As Sars-CoV-2 has spread across the world, some countries have reacted with alarm and thorough preparations, given their previous experiences with Mers or Sars. In these countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, containment of the novel coronavirus became the imperative, regardless of cost. However, other countries chose to treat it like a bad flu strain that would be unstoppable and spread across the population until some kind of immunity was reached. Much of the difference in countries’ initial responses can be attributed to whether they “overreacted”, given prior experience with two other more deadly coronaviruses, or whether they perceived the novel coronavirus from the start as just posing a moderate to low risk to their populations and eventually becoming endemic. In the UK, the assumption until quite recently had seemed to be the latter. The containment phase ended on 12 March. At this point, testing ended for all those with minor symptoms (including frontline health staff), contact tracing stopped, airports remained open without checks on incoming flights or passengers, and physical distancing measures were ruled out. Large events involving tens of thousands of people went ahead a few days later, and non-essential travel continued. After considerable public pressure, lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March with the goal of keeping the coronavirus-related burden on health services within NHS capacity. Where are we now? According to official figures, 16,509 people with Covid-19 have so far died in British hospitals. There are no official statistics for deaths in the community, but ONS data released today shows that of 6,200 Covid-19-related deaths in the week to 10 April, one in six of them happened outside hospital. We are on track for 40,000 deaths by just the end of the first wave of this outbreak, while also having to cope with the astronomical economic costs and heart-rending social implications of being in lockdown for weeks on end. In a significant number of confirmed Covid cases, the health outcomes are severe, the disease can result in multiple organ failure and long-term lung damage, and the clinical need of patients for oxygen, ICU care and ventilators is much higher. Early clinical management of symptoms, to which Boris Johnson had access, means that outcomes are generally better, but that requires testing at an early stage of the disease.
New Zealand is in the enviable position of having fewer than 20 deaths, while Australia has managed to stay under 100. With early physical distancing measures and border control, and aggressive testing, tracing and isolating procedures in place, these countries are in a better position to ease lockdown earlier and get their economy and society going again, while keeping Covid-19-related deaths low. That’s as close to a win-win situation as a government can have right now. However, when these international comparisons are made, some in government say that it is still too early to say how countries are performing, and others say that all countries will be in the same place, and any variation will depend on their healthcare capacity. It is worth thinking through the long-term scenarios for the future of Covid-19. The first scenario: if we have an effective, safe and available vaccine or antiviral in the next 18 months, the countries that minimised loss of life with the least harsh economic restrictions will be in the best position. Australia, New Zealand and numerous east Asian countries have the outbreak under control and can in the short term manage the trickle of cases while waiting for the scientific solution. The second scenario: in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral, some kind of population immunity will be built up so that the virus is not actively transmitting at a high level. This assumes that having the coronavirus leads to immunity for at least two or three years and that subsequent reinfection is mild. Even in this situation, the countries with low numbers of cases can wait for ongoing research on better identification of who is exactly “vulnerable” to developing severe symptoms, and shield these individuals so the burden on ICU care and loss of life are kept to a minimum. While we have some basic idea at population level about who is vulnerable, based on age and pre-existing conditions, scientists do not understand the individual genetic or immunological factors yet. The third (worst-case) scenario: research might find that there is no lasting immunity to the virus, or in fact immune enhancement, which means subsequent reinfections would be more severe (similar to dengue). This creates a real case for countries with the capacity to eliminate the virus and keep in place border controls . Obviously the fewer cases present, the easier it is to eliminate a virus, and in this situation a precautionary approach to letting it spread through the population would have been well warranted. In short, there are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, about the possibility and timeline for a vaccine or antiviral therapy, about who exactly is vulnerable, and about long-term health implications. For example, Italian scientists have warned that some patients are developing Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary paralysis) as a side effect of Covid-19. In this uncertainty, countries that are actively working to contain this virus and keep numbers as low as possible are buying time to build a more informed policy response while also protecting their economies and societies. Others, by letting the virus spread slowly through their populations (only flattening the curve instead of completely stopping the spread), are just gambling with people’s lives, and will be caught in cycles of lockdown/release that will destroy the economy and cause social unrest, as well as increased Covid-19- and non-Covid-19-related deaths. • Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2020-04-22 06:00:38+00:00,100101,2
100115,commentisfree/2020/apr/22/lockdown-coronavirus-crisis-right-to-roam,Opinion,Lockdown is nothing new. We’ve been kept off the land for centuries | George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/lockdown-coronavirus-crisis-right-to-roam,"In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In his speech in Greenwich on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had “panicked” about the coronavirus, inflicting “unnecessary economic damage”. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to “buy and sell freely among each other”. But as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm. In other words, it would take up the call to open London’s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are 131 golf courses in Greater London, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to open their playing fields and extensive grounds. And it would open London’s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access. But a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land. Throughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the “ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom”. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to criminalise trespass in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland’s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam. In November last year, Johnson announced an expansion of police powers to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement. Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are on average eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people. Some young black men have the sense of living in a permanent state of partial lockdown. The government’s own assessment shows that an expansion of stop and search powers has “at best, only minimal effects on violent crime”. In fact, as a primary cause of both the 1981 and 2011 riots, the policy is likely to exacerbate it. Until 1984, police stop and search powers were exercised under the remarkably brutal 1824 Vagrancy Act. Beggars, hawkers, sex workers, Gypsies and Travellers, rough sleepers and anyone “not giving a good account of himself or herself” could be arrested and summarily sentenced to three months’ hard labour. Astonishingly, large sections of this barbaric law remain in force , and it is still sometimes used by the police against homeless people. Police powers to move people on are necessary during this pandemic. But well into the first half of the 20th century, they were used as a form of social control, securing public space for “the right sort”, while excluding “undesirables”. They were a source of great resentment in Victorian England, and commemorated in several satirical ballads, various of which had the title Move on There. One song complains that “swells” (rich and extravagant young men) could get away with anything, while those without the means to bribe the police were “collared”. Today, much of what looks like public space in our cities is in fact privately owned. Many of these pseudo-public spaces are patrolled by security guards, enforcing opaque rules. As a homeless man interviewed by the Guardian observed, most people wouldn’t notice the difference between a publicly and privately owned open space. But “to me, the difference is everything, because I’m not the sort of person they want over there”. Typically, in these places, homeless people are moved on, no music or photography is allowed, and political gatherings are banned. In some of them, the only acceptable activity appears to be spending money. There’s an interesting parallel with urban parks in the 19th century, many of which were also then privately owned. As the historian Katrina Navickas documents, the owners typically banned music and political meetings. The Salvation Army, then an extreme temperance movement, waged its wars against people enjoying themselves in any public places, sparking confrontations that sometimes turned violent. Last year, the Guardian revealed that some London housing estates were excluding children in social housing from playgrounds used by richer residents. The developers of one estate had been granted planning permission on the grounds that its playground would be available to all, after which it replaced a gate with an impenetrable hedge to shut out the poorest residents. We might look for freedom in the countryside, but for centuries it has been the scene of extreme exclusion and injustice. Here, enclosure (the seizure of land from commoners) violently deprived many people of their liberties. The labouring poor were forbidden to live in “close parishes”, where their homes were ripped down by the lords of the manor, to avoid liability for poverty relief. As a result, until the late 19th century in some places, people were crowded into filthy, dilapidated cottages sometimes an hour’s walk from the fields in which they worked, for which they were charged astounding rents.
Today, we have no right of access to 92% of England. The great majority of the accessible land is in the north-west of the country, a long way from where most people live. While in London four times as many BAME people are stopped and searched as white people, in Suffolk they are 17 times more likely to be stopped, and in Dorset, 25 times. Is it any wonder that, despite government efforts at persuasion, so few people of colour visit the countryside? For the moment, our freedoms have to be restricted. But when the lockdown ends, let’s celebrate by demanding a right to roam on open land in both cities and the countryside. Let’s have a legal definition of public space, in which peaceful use and assembly is established as a universal right. The freedom to roam is as fundamental a right as freedom of speech. When the pandemic is over, let’s make this the free nation Johnson boasts about. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",2020-04-22 05:00:36+00:00,100116,67
100161,commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-guardian-view-on-lockdown-choices-who-to-trust,Opinion,The Guardian view on lockdown choices: who to trust? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-guardian-view-on-lockdown-choices-who-to-trust,"Across Europe, the start of June marks a new phase in the coronavirus response. In the coming days, new measures will take effect in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain and Estonia, as well as the UK. Several countries are preparing to reopen restaurants, cafes and theatres, as well as schools. It is a measure of how poorly the UK government has managed the pandemic that even the more limited easing of the lockdown that is due to take place in England inspires more fear than relief. As it is, the week ahead will confront parents of school-age children, 2.2 million people who have until now been “shielding” at home, and millions more adults who have been told they can return to work, with an impossible choice. Should they do what the government says, and begin to let down their guard against the risk of catching the virus? Or should they heed the warnings of the five members of Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) who believe the lifting of lockdown is premature, and the deputy chief medical officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, who on Saturday described the present moment as “very dangerous”? The Guardian does not ask such questions lightly. That they cannot be passed over is a measure of the parlous position England is now in (the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all taking a more cautious approach, although some easing of rules is also taking place). The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Sunday described the government’s approach as slow and steady. But ministers appear to be in a rush, and determined to avoid falling further behind our recovering European neighbours. Why else declare their “five tests” to have been met, when the official Covid-19 alert level has not yet fallen to the level (3) said in May to be a condition for restrictions to be relaxed? Even the announcement was over-hasty, with new rules on social gatherings that should have been spelled out on Sunday instead offered up on Thursday, despite the obvious danger that this would lead to increased socialising and transmissions over the weekend. This, it appears, was judged a price worth paying by a prime minister determined to change the subject after days of public fury about his rule-breaking adviser, Dominic Cummings. The effect of warm weather on the virus is one of many things that scientists and the rest of us are still learning. If we are lucky, the calculated risk being taken by the government in the interests of the economy and its own reputation will pay off. No one is arguing that the lockdown can last indefinitely. If the tools existed to enable any new outbreaks to be quickly dealt with, then the plans could be judged right. The problem is that the evidence points to this not being the case. Design flaws as well as delays in the national testing and tracing system are one cause for concern. Another is the systemic weakness of English local government. Where other large European countries are adjusting rules on a regional basis, city leaders including Andy Burnham have voiced doubts about the viability of the area-specific lockdowns proposed by ministers as a remedy for new outbreaks (while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all gone their own way). Besides such practical considerations, the disdain for public opinion shown by the prime minister and his colleagues over the past week inspires the opposite of confidence. June is an unnerving prospect.",2020-05-31 17:42:41+00:00,100162,2
100231,commentisfree/2020/may/31/coronavirus-economy-change-pandemic,Opinion,Coronavirus is our chance to completely rethink what the economy is for | Malcolm Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/coronavirus-economy-change-pandemic,"There’s been a lot of argument about how best to handle the coronavirus pandemic, but if there are two things on which most people currently agree, it’s that governments should have been better prepared, and that everyone should get back to work as soon as it is safe to do so. After all, it seems more or less self-evident that you need to be ready for unexpected contingencies – and that it is better for the economy to function at full capacity. More PPE would have saved doctors’ and nurses’ lives; more work means less unemployment and more growth. But there is a catch to this, and it has been at the heart of political debate since Machiavelli. It is impossible to achieve both goals at once. Contingency planning requires unused capacity, whereas exploiting every opportunity to the full means losing the flexibility needed to respond to sudden changes of fortune. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that economists started to realise that it might be better to leave a bit of slack in the economy to help cope with exogenous shocks. In the years after the Great Depression, governments saw the problem as “idle men, idle land, idle machines and idle money”. But there were also economists, such as the Englishman William Hutt, who went against the Keynesian consensus and pointed out that there were some things – fire extinguishers, for example – that were valuable precisely because they were never used. Having large stocks of PPE, underemployed nurses, or a lot of spare capacity in ICUs, falls into the same category. Idle resources are what you need in a crisis, so some degree of inefficiency isn’t necessarily a bad idea.
Trying to manage a pandemic in a world of just-in-time production lines and precarious labour brings these issues into sharper focus. On the one hand, there weren’t enough idle resources for most countries to cope adequately with the spread of the virus. On the other, the enforced idleness of the lockdown leads to calls to get the economy moving again. For Donald Trump, the prospect of a prolonged shutdown is particularly alarming because it threatens to undermine the competitiveness of the US economy relative to other nations (notably China) that have dealt with the crisis more efficiently. That’s an argument Machiavelli would have understood very well. One of his constant refrains was that idleness could lead to what he called corruption (the diversion of resources from the public good, which Trump equates with the Dow Jones Industrial Average) – and that corruption leads inevitably to defeat at the hands of your rivals. For Machiavelli, the contagion of corruption was spread above all by Christianity, a “religion of idleness”. And it is true that the Judeo-Christian tradition, with its sabbaths, jubilees, feast days, and religious specialists devoted to a life of prayer and contemplation rather than martial virtue, built a lot of slack into the system. Machiavelli thought it should be squeezed out through laws that would prevent surplus becoming the pretext for idleness, rather in the way that later economists looked to the pressure mechanism of competition to do the same. But there’s a contradiction in Machiavelli’s thinking here, because he also acknowledged that one of the things every polity needed was periodic renewal and reform, and that corruption was what preceded it. So you’re in a double bind: either you can squeeze out the slack and never experience renewal, or you can court corruption and create an opportunity to start over and make things better. With hindsight it looks like that’s one of the problems the religions of idleness tried to address, by incorporating idleness into the calendar. In ancient Hebrew tradition, there were weekly sabbaths, and every seventh year was meant to be a year of release in which the land was left to lie fallow, debts were forgiven and slaves emancipated. The idea was picked up by the Chartist William Benbow, who in 1832 used it as the model for what he called a Grand National Holiday, in effect a month-long general strike that would allow a National Congress to reform society “to obtain for all at the least expense to all, the largest sum of happiness for all”. Benbow’s plan came to nothing, but it provides an alternative model for how the lockdown might be viewed. The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has complained that the lockdown is a state of exception with an increase in executive powers and a partial abrogation of the rule of law; but the flipside is that it is the closest thing to a Grand National Holiday that most of us have ever experienced. Despite all the suffering the pandemic has caused, for many it has also meant no work, debt relief, empty roads and a rare opportunity to live on free money from the government. Generally speaking, exogenous threats like wars or natural disasters act as pressure mechanisms forcing us to redouble our efforts to combat them together. The benefit of contagion is that the only way to combat it is to do less rather than more. That has some demonstrable advantages. There has been a dramatic global fall in carbon emissions. The only comparable reduction in greenhouse gases during the past 30 years came as the result of the decline of industrial production in eastern Europe after the fall of communism. That was managed exceptionally badly because neoliberal economists thought that what post-communist states needed was the pressure of free market competition. Shock therapy would galvanise the economy.
The pandemic has been a shock alright, but its effect has been the opposite of galvanising. People everywhere had to stop whatever they were doing or planning to do in the future. That provides an altogether different model of political change. The philosopher Walter Benjamin once noted that while Karl Marx claimed that revolutions were the locomotives of world history, things might actually turn out to be rather different: “Perhaps revolutions are the human race … travelling in this train, reaching for the emergency brake.” Everyone keeps saying that we are living through strange times, but what is strange about it is that because everything has come to a stop, it is as though we are living out of time. The emergency brake has been pulled and time is standing still. It feels uncanny, and there’s more slack in the world economy than there ever has been before. And that means, as both Benjamin and Machiavelli would have recognised, that there is also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for change and renewal. For some, this might mean a shorter working week, or less air travel. For others, it might suggest the opportunity for a more fundamental remaking of our political system. A space of possibility has unexpectedly opened up, so although the lockdown may be coming to an end, perhaps the standstill should continue. • Malcolm Bull teaches at Oxford.

100242,commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-government-has-harnessed-the-power-of-infotainment,Opinion,The government has harnessed the power of infotainment | David Mitchell,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-government-has-harnessed-the-power-of-infotainment,"It was such a relief, on Monday afternoon, to see that the government had finally sorted out its messaging. Up to then it had been so confused! Stay at home! Go out a bit! Go to the park but don’t sit down! Put on a mask if you’re having a picnic! Stay alert – the virus may be behind you! Catch the virus at a sustainable rate! Somehow try to do some economic activity! Anything but a podcast! You may not go to your second home! But you may now buy a second home! But you may not now go to it! See your parents one at a time, up to a maximum of four! Do not exercise for more than an hour! If you go to Cumbria you will be killed! Wear adorable homemade masks, not scary medical ones, which are reserved for concealing compassionate smiles from the dying! Clap separately but simultaneously! If you’ve got dementia, remember to take extra care! If you’re anxious to comply with the rules, how can you know that you are? And equally, if you’re anxious not to, how can you know that you aren’t? That’s just as galling. Like a vandal discovering that the wall he’s defacing is actually a specially designated civic space for people to express themselves. But now it’s been sorted! The government has finally twigged that the best way to get through to people at times like these is with drama. Drama has an unmatched power to communicate complexity, and to resolve apparent contradiction, to humanise vast and ungraspable concepts. And that brings me back to Monday afternoon’s broadcast and the launch of HM Government’s new pandemic-explaining character “Dominic Cummings”, star of the new state-sponsored infotainment strand Cummings and Goings. An everyman in the mould of Hector the tax inspector, Dominic Cummings appears to be the product of CGI rather than Hector’s more conventional cartoon animation, and looks impressively human, albeit slightly sullied by the digital taint of the uncanny valley. His movements, surely the product of Andy Serkis’s inimitable amphibianesque physicality (thanks Andy for stepping up when your country needs you), were projected on to a verdant garden backdrop and the character then seated himself at a simple table with a glass of water, presumably to allay any subconscious audience concerns that he needs to keep moist. Then we were in for an informative treat! Enough of the hypothetical scenarios, let’s hear about what an everyday decent guy has been doing under his own unique and specific circumstances – because, in the end, everyone’s circumstances are unique and specific, and guidelines can only ever be that: a guide. And rules can also only ever be that. And laws too. And the lines on a road, just guidelines, lines guiding you wherever you want to go. In the case of Dominic Cummings, that was a big phlegmy trip with wife and child up to his parents’ property in Durham. That’s a long way from his home in London, but here is the government finally showing it gets it: not everyone’s family estate is in the Home Counties. Come on – wake up, media bubble! Some families have to look much further afield to be able to buy a large amount of land. That’s the reality of modern Britain. Hooray that it’s finally being recognised.
As with a lot of important art, Cummings and Goings is rich with allegory. Durham doesn’t just mean Durham. Durham is an idea, a feeling, a state of mind – a hope, a plan or a secret. We all have a Durham – that’s what Cummings is saying – but it’s probably not literally Durham. His Durham is Durham but your Durham may be Brighton or the outer Hebrides or a pub that still opens on the quiet. And of course we aren’t meant to take literally the idea that Dominic Cummings drove 30 miles to a riverbank at Barnard Castle on his wife’s birthday purely because all the opticians were closed. Nobody would be so stupid as to think that could be fact. Is it fiction then? Assuming so, like all the greatest fiction, it conveys a deeper truth. What is that truth? Well, as both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said, people need to “make up their own minds”. The nuance and complexity of Cummings as a character is a testament to how much respect our leaders have for us. Not for the British a patronising clear and packaged message, but instead an unvarnished deep, insoluble human truth – pain, fear, disdain, secrecy, compromise and how scruffy a shirt can look after a comparatively short period of wearing it, all laid bare. This is a massive advance in public communication and I predict Cummings will be bigger than the Green Cross Code Man. We’ll be buying dolls of him – little nodding ones for the dashboard, implicitly endorsing our every journey. I look forward to Cummings’s future adventures whatever they’ll be. Cummings saying “lovely bluebells” when his eyesight goes weird again on the A1(M); Cummings losing his job and starting a podcast; Cummings climbing up a 5G mast to set fire to it, slipping and ending up dangling from his own beanie; Cummings taking his wife and child on a 100mph circuit of Brands Hatch in order to safely check his tyre pressure. And of course, the real stroke of comic genius is how Boris Johnson joins in with the fiction, like Tony Hart did with Mr Bennett. Whatever Cummings does, Johnson’s endorsement provides the punchline. A lesser leader might excuse Cummings by saying he made a mistake but not a very serious one. But Johnson said he “acted responsibly, legally and with integrity”. Not just “he is in general a responsible, law-abiding person who has integrity” but on this particular occasion – the Durham trip under lockdown plus eye test at the national speed limit – for that bit of his life, Cummings “acted responsibly, legally and with integrity”. Etch that phrase on to the side of a giant aluminium penis, call it “The Treachery of Words” and you’d have a major contender for the Turner prize.",2020-05-31 09:00:07+00:00,100243,107

It’s voluntary, so those of us with smartphones must decide: should we download the app? The health secretary, Matt Hancock, thinks we should, claiming that we would be “doing our duty and helping to save lives”. If only it were that simple. Even if 80% of smartphone users (60% of the UK population) download the app, which is the adoption rate epidemiologists say is needed to make it work, the app won’t save lives. Our first problem is that the UK’s testing capability is too slow stop the spread of the virus. Once you’re infected, you’re contagious for two days before the onset of Covid-19 symptoms and most contagious on the first day of symptoms. To break the chain of transmission, you must alert your contacts within that narrow window of opportunity, so that they can quarantine for the 14-day incubation period and report if they too show symptoms and need testing. Yet many people struggle or are unable to get tested, and the average return time for a test result is five days – with the longest taking 13 days. If we could improve our testing capacity to meet the tight turnaround needed to alert people within the “window of opportunity”, and if we built an app that sent alerts based on a positive test result, then we might have something useful. However, the app we are being invited to download doesn’t rely on a positive test result. Instead, it asks us to self-report symptoms. This introduces several pathways to failure. The app only asks if you have two out of 14 Covid-19 symptoms recognised by the World Health Organization: fever and continuous cough. This means it may fail to account for infected people who show the other symptoms – and thus will not alert their contacts. The app may not flag up people who don’t have a fever, who account for about a third of positive cases. No self-reporting app will work for people who are infected but never show symptoms, which the US Centers for Disease Control estimates could amount to as many as 30% of cases. Only a test will detect those cases. Still, it can’t do any harm to download the app, right? Actually, no. Unless the government compels employers to pay people to quarantine for 14 days every time they receive an alert, people may feel pressured to ignore the alerts and keep working, even if that risks their health and that of their contacts. Also, not every worker is entitled to sick pay. Those are policy problems, not an app problem, but if we don’t solve them, the app won’t work and the virus will continue to spread. The app also puts our data and privacy at greater risk of an accidental breach or a cyberattack because it is based on a centralised model, which stores our data on a central server. A decentralised model, which keeps our data on our devices, minimises this risk. Most other countries have opted for a decentralised model for their app. There’s still time for the UK to change course. Most worrying of all, the government has so far denied parliament the opportunity to pass primary legislation to protect and limit the use of our data relating to using the app. Without such legislation, we risk creating a new set of problems. For instance, do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine? Do we want our employers to be able to know our Covid-19 status, or to be able to pressure us to download this “voluntary” app as a condition of returning to work?
Do we want private companies to access this data, the way they already access so much else? Can we request that our data be deleted after the pandemic or will the government retain it indefinitely, and use it however it wants? Will this app exist only for the duration of the pandemic, or could the government require it to be used as a permanent health tracker, as is already being planned in the Chinese city of Hangzhou? The answers to these questions could change our lives and the balance of power between individuals, employers and the state. Parliament must therefore scrutinise all of this and, where necessary, legislate and specify oversight and enforcement mechanisms. A contact tracing app could play a useful role in our pandemic response, but only if we set it up to succeed, not fail. If we create an app that really could help save lives, and which we could use with confidence, there will be no need to ask us to download it out of a sense of duty. We’ll want it. • Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster",2020-05-31 07:00:06+00:00,100272,2
100348,commentisfree/2020/may/30/dominic-cummings-actions-damage-public-health,Opinion,Dominic Cummings’ actions damage public trust | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/dominic-cummings-actions-damage-public-health,"We are in a public health crisis unprecedented in living memory. We have written to the prime minister because we are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the public. There is ample evidence that effective epidemic control requires the public to trust and respect both the messages and the messengers who are advocating action. This trust has been badly damaged by the actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest, and Boris Johnson’s subsequent unwillingness to remove him. As lockdown is eased, public trust and high compliance is essential to reduce the risk of a second spike in infections and deaths. It is vital for all people in positions of power to follow the rules with the same discipline as the rest of the population. The public also needs to see that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place rapidly and effectively. A national track and trace scheme is a major undertaking. This makes it even more crucial that there is complete transparency about likely time scales and the risks associated with the strategy and plan. The public mood is fragile and unlikely to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy that goes on to fail. We are also concerned that the needs of people primarily affected by non-Covid-19 diseases are being neglected. For example, since the pandemic hit, there has been a 70% or more reduction in cancer diagnoses and there is an estimated backlog of 100,000 undiagnosed or untreated cancer cases (growing by about 5,000 a week). Similar backlogs are evident in every non-communicable disease. This exceptional situation also requires urgent and detailed planning and investment.

My colleagues Picasso, Monet, Matisse and Renoir all smoked and had long and very productive lives. Recently, Gillian Ayres died at 88, smoking away to the end. It’s Catherine Bennett giving the health advice, not me. She would be telling Monet off for smoking. There’s something else: petrol fumes and what they have done to us. I asked what’s going to happen now we have had two months without many cars. A French doctor told me that there had been fewer heart attacks and strokes in this time, which is just what they blame tobacco for. Tobacco has been demonised in Britain, not so in France or Germany, not to mention Greece, with the lowest number of deaths and the highest number of smokers. We are messy creatures and all have to die. Why go on about it? The Russians say, if you don’t smoke or drink you die healthy. Death awaits you even if you do not smoke. My smoking is a trivial thing blown out of all proportion. Love life. David Hockney Normandy, France More to Sweden than Ikea As a social anthropologist who studies health policy and Swedish culture, I am intrigued, bemused and horrified by the international coverage of Sweden’s Covid-19 strategy. One problem is the armchair anthropologists who use Ikea and Abba jokes to authoritatively critique Swedish culture (“Sweden’s Covid policy is a model for the right. It’s also a deadly folly”, Comment). We do not blindly trust the government. We read the news, we watch the public health agency’s briefings and we make our own decisions. We are both communal and individualistic in ways that may seem contradictory to outsiders but usually make sense to us. Moreover, defining Swedishness misses the point. What is more useful is to examine how Swedish culture is defined, used (and abused), by whom, to what audience and why. The question is not why Swedes are like this or that, it is this: what is so provocative about their approach that compels the international media to construct a drama about our Covid-19 experience? Rachel Irwin, researcher Lund University, Sweden Give hope to young people The call of those committed to action to help young people was relevant and timely (“An open letter: why we need a National Youth Corps”, Comment). The idea of a Youth Corps is not new. From 1998, the New Deal for the Young and Unemployed incorporated a range of options to tackle head on youth unemployment, following the Labour victory. As education and employment secretary, I and colleagues could take this forward because of the investment made available by Gordon Brown through the levy on the profits of the utilities. What was interesting in terms of the take-up (up to 100,000 in the first year) was the desire of young people to rejoin education and training, but their lack of enthusiasm for opportunities where they could not see a medium-term prospect of a job. In my view, it will not be possible to scale up such a project in the time frame set out by the authors of the letter but, if a start was made now, over several months a significant contribution could be made to counteracting the despair and alienation that many young people will feel if they cannot access education, training or a job. David Blunkett House of Lords, London SW1 My father’s anti-fascist fight Harriet Sherwood’s article about the 43 Group brought back a piece of my family’s history (“The Jews who fought postwar fascists on the streets of London”, News). A fascist meeting at which Oswald Mosley was the main speaker was held in a Bethnal Green school in Wilmot Street in November 1947. The 43 Group heard about the meeting and rallied to protest. Although not a member of the 43 Group, my father, Jack Shaw, was there. I was six and my mother was about to give birth to my twin sisters, so my father was torn between family responsibilities and a desire to meet the fascists head on. He was arrested during a fierce fight in the streets outside the school and duly appeared at Old Street magistrates’ court. Thanks to the Jewish leftwing lawyer Jack Gaster, his case was dismissed.

100507,commentisfree/2020/may/29/the-guardian-view-on-downing-street-briefings-time-to-change-a-broken-system,Opinion,The Guardian view on Downing Street briefings: time to change a broken system | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/the-guardian-view-on-downing-street-briefings-time-to-change-a-broken-system,"Boris Johnson’s government began daily Downing Street briefings about the Covid-19 pandemic in the second half of March. Back then, the briefings tried to do two things at once. They addressed an urgent public need for reliable information about the advance of the coronavirus. They also tried to shape the way the public should respond to the health, lifestyle and economic threats that it carried. The structure of the briefings evolved on the hoof. They were far from perfect in a number of ways. Nevertheless, in the absence of parliament, which went into recess until 21 April, the briefings performed a useful public information and advice function for an anxious nation in lockdown. Ten weeks on, that is quite simply no longer true. The gap between the public’s caution and the government’s desire to lift lockdown restrictions is stark. Mr Johnson has also been badly damaged by the Cummings affair. The daily updates have become increasingly tendentious and uninformative. Objectivity has fought a losing battle against the government’s increasingly beleaguered mishandling of the pandemic. It is therefore now time to end the briefings in their current form. The decline in the briefings has had many features. Statistics have been presented in inconsistent ways that sow confusion and even suspicion. Ministers, whose talent varies, have grown more defensive and evasive when questioned. The inevitable overlaps between political and scientific messaging have become notably more opaque. Government suspicion of the media has caused curtailing of questioning and the refusal of follow-ups. On Tuesday, parliament, to which any government is constitutionally accountable, returns for two months. It is time to do things differently and better. The defects of the Downing Street system came to a head on Thursday in the briefing over which Mr Johnson presided disgracefully. There was no serious attempt to inform in the spirit of sound science that had marked the early weeks of the pandemic. Instead, Mr Johnson resorted to browbeating of advisers, journalists and the public. Some of Thursday’s problems were of long standing: the presentation of meaningless aggregate figures, the ever-shifting baselines used for statistical trends (Thursday’s slides all started their measurements on different dates), the potentially misleading shapes of graphs, the now-you-see-them-now-you-don’t approach to information about care homes, and the abject abandonment of embarrassing international comparisons. Other problems, though, were far more immediate. Mr Johnson’s desperation to keep Dominic Cummings in his job was at the heart of most of them. It meant that Thursday’s briefing became a concerted effort to bulldoze all questions about Mr Cummings out of the way, and instead to bombard the public with announcements about easing the lockdown. Mr Johnson bluntly refused to discuss Mr Cummings. When he then prevented England’s chief scientist and chief medical officer from answering any Cummings-related questions either, the prime minister crossed a line. He destroyed the briefings’ always uneasy balance between public information and political propaganda. When Mr Johnson said that the purpose of Thursday’s briefing was “to crack on with our programme and [get] our messages across”, he gave the game away. That was not the original purpose of the briefings at all. But the briefings have long since shaken off much of their original purpose of providing clear public information. Instead they have become a politically driven daily broadcast at the public’s expense. Mr Johnson’s reputation and ratings have been thrown overboard as he clung to the manifestly out-of-order Mr Cummings. Now the reliability of the briefings has been sacrificed too. As the governments of Britain edge their way out of the lockdown next week, it is time to disentangle the different threads that make up the briefings. Information about the pandemic should be under the control of independent government scientists, medical advisers and statisticians, who should be able to present the facts without political spin or censorship. Policy is the government’s and the people’s business. Ministers are accountable to parliament for what they intend to do next. Britain, especially England, is now advancing into a dangerous new phase of the pandemic. The country needs the right tools to ensure that wise choices are made. The current briefings make that far more difficult.",2020-05-29 17:30:20+00:00,100508,67
100563,commentisfree/2020/may/29/shielding-impossible-coronavirus-testing-and-tracing,Opinion,The problem with 'shielding' people from coronavirus? It's almost impossible | Devi Sridhar and Yasmin Rafiei,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/shielding-impossible-coronavirus-testing-and-tracing,"In the last UK government report on coronavirus policy, the word “shielding” is mentioned 36 times. The UK, Sweden and the Netherlands have all shown much interest in this strategy of cocooning vulnerable groups in their homes or shelters while attempting to reopen economies outside. To date, shielding has meant asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus not to leave home, to avoid any face-to-face interaction, and to restrict human contact to the digital realm. What goes unsaid is that this strategy of shielding is distinctly western, and has not proven particularly effective at protecting these individuals. The first vocal proponent of shielding was Boris Johnson, who announced in mid-March that the UK would keep its economy open and achieve “herd immunity”. In the meantime, those at high risk of coronavirus would need to protect themselves by shielding from the rest of society. David Halpern, the chief executive of the behavioural insights team, which is part-owned by the government, said, “there’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you’ll want to cocoon, you’ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don’t catch the disease – and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity’s been achieved in the rest of the population”. This plan turned out to be disastrous. Deaths ravaged care homes and households, and the UK quickly reversed tack and introduced a national lockdown on 23 March. The UK now has one of the highest death tolls in the world. Yet shielding strategies stuck: governments in the US, UK, Sweden and other western countries still advise confinement for vulnerable populations. Most (with the exception of Sweden) recommend shielding in conjunction with a national lockdown. In contrast, east Asian governments have adopted policies focused almost exclusively on mass testing, tracing, and isolation of infectious individuals. In South Korea and Taiwan, governments made two face masks a week available to citizens and registered non-citizens across the country. The core objective in these countries was to drive the virus out and prevent both young and old people catching it. Two key assumptions underlie shielding use in the UK. First, that if 15% of the population, say, were vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus, this group could reasonably be isolated from the remaining 85%, who were likely to contract only a mild illness. And second, that those who have contracted coronavirus would develop protective immunity. Yet we still don’t know if people develop immunity once they have become infected with coronavirus. And in practice, the first assumption falls apart. According to one study in China, 80% of coronavirus transmissions occurred at home, where multi-generational living complicates attempts at shielding. Elderly people who are shielding and living with family members under one roof are especially at risk as countries move to reopen their economies. This risk shouldn’t be understated. In the US, 13 million Americans over 65 live in multigenerational households. Some don’t have the space for their own room. For members of this group who are clinically extremely vulnerable, shielding isn’t really an option. Even elderly people who live alone need regular contact for care and services. According to the Institute on Aging in the US, 65% of older adults rely exclusively on family and friends to provide them with assistance. Another 30% receive paid assistance alongside their family support. Every point of contact in the network of care for an elderly person who is shielding increases their threat of infection. Beyond immediate family and friends, people who are shielding are also more likely to need regular contact to receive medical care, grocery deliveries, and transportation. The extent to which at-risk populations must rely on others for essential care and services is a huge challenge to the efficacy of any shielding strategy. We’ve seen that despite attempts to shield people in nursing and care homes, death rates in these places are consistently among the highest in national tolls. Consider Sweden, which remains lockdown-free, despite deaths ravaging its care homes and elder-care services. At least 50% of the country’s coronavirus deaths occurred within nursing homes, according to Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of the Swedish public health agency. In the UK, where a national shielding strategy was temporarily adopted, care homes also became hotbeds for infection. Care home deaths were found to be higher than 22,000 by academics at the London School of Economics. Inefficacies aside, shielding itself is harmful to the mental health of those who are vulnerable. Older adults are already at heightened risk of depression and suicidal thoughts; according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, social isolation from shielding can exacerbate these mental health challenges. It’s unlikely that the mental health of members of this group who have to shield will improve from being asked to shield indefinitely. And the elderly alone don’t bear the risks of coronavirus. Many younger individuals live with key risk factors that put them into vulnerable groups, and some will be deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Earlier this month, the world’s largest patient study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxford University found that key factors relating to coronavirus deaths included uncontrolled diabetes, severe asthma, obesity, poverty and ethnic minority status. As western countries ease lockdown, suggestions have been made for those being shielded to stay “cocooned” away indefinitely until a vaccine or antiviral therapy is found or natural herd immunity is reached. What we suggest instead is a general strategy of suppression, where governments make a commitment to keeping daily new cases as low as possible through an active testing-and-tracing programme and real-time monitoring of transmission. At the same time, the government should advise those in “shielded groups” about their individual risk, as well as provide them with data about transmission within their communities, and then leave these individuals to make an informed decision about how and when they would like to engage in society. For a government to pursue shielding alone, with its proven inefficacies and intrinsic harms, would be nothing but an Orwellian strategy – one that presides over the fates of those at greatest risk, against all evidence. There are serious ethical and moral questions around building a society where the healthy and young are left to circulate, and the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable are hidden away. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh; Yasmin Rafiei is a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh and an MD candidate at Stanford University • This article was amended on 1 and 4 June 2020. It originally stated that shielding has meant asking the elderly, chronically ill, and others vulnerable to hospitalisation from coronavirus not to leave home; in fact shielding applies to those who are “clinically extremely vulnerable”. In addition, the behavioural insights team is not part of the government as an earlier version said, although it is part-owned by the Cabinet Office. And the same team did not develop the “herd immunity” plan, as was previously suggested.",2020-05-29 14:03:16+00:00,100564,2
100574,commentisfree/2020/may/29/test-and-trace-public-trust-government-boris-johnson-lockdown,Opinion,"For test and trace to work, the public needs to trust this government. But how can we? | Polly Toynbee",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/test-and-trace-public-trust-government-boris-johnson-lockdown,"The unlocking begins, as some schools open on Monday, as do outdoor markets and car showrooms, and households can meet in private gardens. Good news. But after his catastrophic delay in entering lockdown, how is anyone to know if Boris Johnson’s opening up will be any better? He might be following “the science”, or he might be following fellow libertarians, such as the Spectator editor’s demand that “It’s time to restore liberty”, or the Sun’s “Ale meet again” pressure for pubs to open. The chief scientist pointed out yesterday that there are still 8,000 new cases a day; the infection rate, or R number, is still near one. This relaxing of rules falls under the shadow of the 60,000 excess deaths that have occurred, representing not just personal tragedies but a national shame. The Financial Times shows Britain to be “world-beating” only in our deaths per million – worse than Donald Trump’s USA, and Italy. Slow lockdowns created high death rates.
The virus is expected to break out in pockets across the country, but neither testing nor tracing is yet up to speed. Health secretary Matt Hancock “launched” test and track yesterday morning because it was promised for 1 June’s primary school openings, not because it’s ready. Anyone can do a “launch” – I can announce the launch of my new career as a brain surgeon or a tight-rope walker. This government’s bad habit of announcing and failing, overpromising and underdelivering, raises fears that they don’t know if this is really time to ease up. Nor can we altogether trust the civil servant scientists who have stood by their lecterns, obedient to their masters – as the editor of the Lancet has warned in the Guardian. We don’t know if the time is right. But we will soon find out. Relaxing the rules relies on good testing and tracing, with public trust vital for compliance. But the testing figures are still a fraud: the government claims there is the capacity to perform 161,000 tests a day and that “84% of the tests from the drive-through centres are returned within 24 hours, 95% of all tests are returned within 48 hours”; but Radio 4’s More or Less has revealed that in reality barely half the number announced are actual people tested, once duplicate tests and non-tests are deducted. Without honesty and precision, nothing will be trusted. No doubt 25,000 contact tracers have been hired, but they are nowhere near ready to go: each has to have a DBS check, which normally takes a month. As the Guardian has revealed, tracers complain they have no contact with anyone, just a computer system that isn’t working: as I write, an experienced contact tracer has sent me another “critical incident” message she received locking her out of the malfunctioning system. Councils, whose expert public health services were ignored until now, are suddenly told they are key to stamping out local virus eruptions – but no one has linked them to the centre. Reasonable people would understand that setting up something this complex is bound to take time: Dido Harding, the chair of NHS track and trace, wisely contradicts Hancock and says it won’t be up and running for a month. That is at least believable, and credibility is all. What remains forever unbelievable is that Boris Johnson closed down contact tracing 11 weeks ago: if he hadn’t, we might have a European-level service – never mind his absurd “world-beating”. From Monday, millions more return to work, often thrown into close contact with others, with no guarantee they will be safe. In shops, takeaways, warehouses or offices, there is often no way to protect people: danger could be anywhere. Johnson airily asserts he will “insist that business across the country look after their workers and are Covid-secure”. How? All employers need to do is show they have made reasonable efforts, with plenty of masking tape and signage. They only risk a legal case if they’ve committed an act of gross negligence, says Ian Hart, the editor of Safety and Health Practitioner. The most unbelievable of the prime minister’s promises is that the Health and Safety Executive will conduct “spot inspections to ensure businesses are keeping our employees safe”. First, the HSE’s inspectors, along with all other regulators, were first to be stood down – as you would expect from a Johnson government: never let a good crisis go to waste.
Second, Johnson has been an “’elf ’n’ safety gone mad” rabble-rouser since time immemorial, his fallback for any thin column-writing day. He and his claque have won, eviscerating the HSE, ordering it in 2011 to cut inspections by a third. Its budget has been cut by £100m since 2010, and it has lost a third of its workforce. Local authorities have had to cut health and safety, and environmental health, to the bone. “Light-touch” regulation and “bonfires of red tape” have been favourite Tory battle cries, with Johnson the cheerleader. Labour’s employment spokesman, Andy McDonald, says an employer’s chance of a spot inspection is once in every 275 years. Leftwingers, Johnson wrote, like “to ban hunting, smoking, smacking, snacking, and to swaddle everyone in the public and private sector with a great choking duvet of risk assessments”. Speeding is normal: “The speed limit is 10mph too low. It bares [sic] no relation to the speed motorists actually use.” During the Labour government, he complained of “the ever more elaborate regulation of the workplace”. Even a bylaw banning swimming without a permit in the busiest lanes of the Thames was “the kind of gratuitous legislation that is sapping the moral fibre of the nation.” During his party leadership campaign he waved a kipper claiming EU-regulated packaging was “pointless, pointless, expensive, environmentally damaging ’elf ’n’ safety” (It was revealed to be his own government’s rule). So for people returning anxiously to their workplaces, uncertain of their safety, how must it feel to find their fate in the hands of such a man? • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 1 June 2020.

100766,commentisfree/2020/may/28/the-guardian-view-on-easing-the-lockdown-putting-politics-before-people,Opinion,The Guardian view on easing the lockdown: putting politics before people | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/the-guardian-view-on-easing-the-lockdown-putting-politics-before-people,"The United Kingdom went into the Covid-19 crisis as one nation. It seems likely to exit from the pandemic as several. At the outset, the UK’s different governments took similar approaches. Lockdown rules were observed by citizens in all parts of the country, with some infamous individual exceptions like Dominic Cummings. As the onslaught starts to slacken, however, differential approaches are likely to become more important. These differences have now been embodied in the radically contrasted announcements made in London and in Edinburgh this week about the next stage. In England, the government has always been keener to lift the lockdown early. The case for this has never been easy to accept. The virus has not been a lighter scourge in England. The driving force has been a volatile mix of ideology and window dressing. Boris Johnson and his ministers have announced arbitrary goals – often under short-term pressure – and have then battled, generally unsuccessfully and at human cost, to meet them. The approach has never been comprehensive, well explained or effective. Among the most shocking examples have been shortages of personal protective equipment, testing failures for nursing homes and the refusal to test at ports and airports. This week’s virus tracing measures in England are the latest example of this shambolic approach. Mr Johnson said on 20 May that a “world beating” system to test and trace for coronavirus would be in place by 1 June. Easing the lockdown is umbilically linked to the need for such a system. Without it the dangers of a second wave of cases are very real. Yet it is now clear that the tracing system in England will be much more muddled, modest and incomplete than Mr Johnson claimed. A much trumpeted app does not yet exist. It will not be ready before late June. A slower, less efficient and more labour-intensive tracing system is now starting to come into operation, but there are numerous teething problems. Nevertheless the UK government is pushing ahead. Mr Johnson set the ball rolling in his botched broadcast on 10 May; now, right on cue, he has managed to get scientific cover for the move from Sage, though other scientists have different views. He has also brought forward other measures from July to mid-June and been followed by the ever greedy Premier League. This is chaos waiting to happen. Mr Johnson’s eagerness is driven not just by his generally slapdash approach but also by his desperation to drown out the Cummings scandal. It seems all too likely that he will fail on both fronts, combining a mismanaged easing, which risks causing a spike in Covid-19 cases, with a stupid and damaging attempt to keep Mr Cummings in post. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon’s government has proceeded in an altogether more cautious, logical and planned manner. Mark Drakeford in Wales and Arlene Foster in Northern Ireland have done the same, but Scotland’s first minister has now committed to some easing from the end of this week. Many of these measures have been permitted in England for nearly three weeks, but Ms Sturgeon’s message remains a more careful one and she has done nothing to encourage reckless headlines of the kind that Mr Johnson ignited so stupidly earlier in May. Travelling more than six miles in Scotland to take exercise will remain discouraged, for example. In England, one can travel 260 miles or more. Scotland’s approach is far closer to public opinion in all parts of the UK, England included. One of the great lessons of the pandemic has been that governments that trust their publics, level with them, and prepare and explain their next moves properly, are the ones that enjoy public confidence for their handling. Ms Sturgeon, Mr Drakeford and Ms Foster continue to do that. Mr Johnson, as this week has underscored, sometimes seems to barely care. The people of England deserve so much better.",2020-05-28 17:21:26+00:00,100767,2
100778,commentisfree/2020/may/28/ppe-testing-contact-tracing-shambles-outsourcing-coronavirus,Opinion,"After PPE and testing, contact tracing looks like the next government shambles | David McCoy",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/ppe-testing-contact-tracing-shambles-outsourcing-coronavirus,"Curbing the coronavirus outbreak involves a familiar mantra: test, trace, isolate. As of this week, the government will begin to roll out the second part of this strategy. In theory, contact tracers will call or text people in England who test positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide a list of everyone they have met for longer than 15 minutes, who will then receive a message instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are rolling out separate programmes). But already, England’s contact-tracing strategy looks set to be hobbled by the government’s reluctance to involve local authorities and regional public health expertise in its coronavirus response from the outset, and its dogmatic commitment to outsourcing health services to the private sector. Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading the programme of testing and tracing, recently conceded that the system won’t be fully operational at the local level until late June. Elsewhere, contact tracers have spoken of difficulties accessing the government system, describing it as a “complete shambles”. One recruit reportedly said their training amounted to reading a pdf and taking an online quiz - “all of which takes an hour”. For an idea of how contact tracing works best, look to Germany. When interviewed about the country’s successful contact-tracing programme recently on Newsnight, the German minister of health described how the response had worked through the country’s federal structures and with the 400 different “communities” that are responsible for the track and trace system. England, on the other hand, started by pursuing a call-centre model run by Serco and staffed with customer service employees paid just above minimum wage. Recruitment agencies tasked with finding contact tracers are reportedly offering an hourly wage of £8.72 to staff with experience of “telephone or face-to-face customer services”. Viewing contact tracers as customer service call handlers may be a good business model for Serco, but I would like to know if a single public health specialist in this country thinks this was a good idea. Contact tracing is fundamentally a behavioural intervention; when used well, contact tracers don’t just deliver messages about quarantine but also provide reactive advice and reassurance, and can act as important “eyes and ears”, gathering local intelligence that can be passed on to other members of the public health team. In Korea, health authorities deployed teams of specialist epidemiological intelligence service officers. In Massachusetts, local departments of health carried out contact tracing assisted by volunteers from the public health community, graduate students, Peace Corps volunteers, medical assistants and retired nurses, all of whom were paid more than twice the local minimum wage. This government’s enthusiasm for outsourcing and centralisation has been an Achilles heel in its coronavirus strategy. Although it recently announced an extra £300m to support local authorities in England to deliver the new test and trace strategies, these authorities will have their work cut out to quickly stitch together a coherent and organised programme from a confusing landscape of NHS commissioners and providers, parallel central initiatives, outsourced private contractors, and the recently established Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). The JBC’s roles include collecting and analysing data about Covid-19 infection rates across England, identifying and providing real-time analysis about local outbreaks and recommending appropriate responses to spikes in infections – for example, whether schools or workplaces in local areas should be closed, or whether different restrictions should be imposed in different areas. Details on how the JBC will be staffed or set up to provide real-time data and intelligence for local authorities haven’t been published. Somewhat bizarrely, rather than appointing a public health specialist to lead the body, the government has appointed Tom Hurd, a senior Home Office counter-terrorism official. According to the Institute for Government, the JBC is modelled on the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which analyses counter-terrorism intelligence and sets the terrorism threat level for the country. In much the same way, the JBC will set a coronavirus threat according to five different levels. But as with all centralised bureaucracies, there’s a risk that the JBC will contribute to delays, as data trickles down to the local areas where it’s needed most. There’s also a risk that members of the public will be put off by their data being held by an organisation modelled on a centralised counter-terrorism organisation. Crucially, test results can’t be anonymised if they are to be used in local disease control management. Once again, trust in the system is vital. Both the JBC and local authorities will have to rely on the various private companies that have been contracted to deliver aspects of the testing and contact-tracing strategy in England, including Randox, Deloitte, Serco, G4S and Sodexo. The detailed specifications of their contracts are not public, and the division of roles and responsibilities between the centre, local authorities and the private sector remain unclear. It’s hard not to wonder why England has created such a complicated and fragmented architecture for itself, rather than following the example of other countries that have involved local authorities from the outset. I previously worked as director of public health in Hammersmith and Fulham, and I’ve seen the efforts of public health teams in north-east London during this epidemic. Across the country, we have smart, competent and committed public health officers. Indeed, the UK has one of the best specialised public health training programmes in the world. Although we are seeing the emergence of a more prominent role for Public Health England’s regional teams and local authority public health departments, these specialised resources should never have been so neglected. The government’s coronavirus response should have had local authorities and local health expertise at its core all along. • David McCoy is a professor of global public health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London • This article was amended on 29 May 2020.

There will probably be a second wave | David Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-infection-rate-too-high-second-wave,"We all now know the basics – the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to. If it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially. If it is less than 1.0 it will eventually disappear. There are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions; and the “effective R” or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus. We calculate the R in several ways. What it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time; but these take a week or two to process and report. Thus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers. The government’s science committee, Sage, estimates that the R value for the UK was between 0.7 and 1.0 on 22 May. This is an average value across the nation, and there is substantial regional variation – Re may be twice as high in the north-east than in London, the original centre of the UK’s epidemic. The R value varies across individuals, with “super-spreading” events being associated with a high proportion of the infections, and many people, perhaps most, not passing the infection on to anyone. Infectious disease modelling and virus sequencing data suggest that, early in the epidemic, 10% or less of virus carriers led to about 80% of infections. The amount of virus each individual carries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others – at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services – is important too. Thus, one man may have infected more than 90 clubgoers in South Korea, and one member of a choir in Washington State may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal. Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more. This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not drop precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later. The epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards. To decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 – and no one thinks it has declined to that level. As Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: “A fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.”
So where does this leave us over the next few months? With Re so close to 1.0 there are basically two options. First, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people – bringing Re down further – so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China. It became clear from the prime minister’s announcement on 10 May on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus – guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus. As a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious. Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the “back to work and school” decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place. Indoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly. On trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting. And the use of face coverings should be the new normal – including at government press briefings.
The contact-tracking system must be up and running efficiently. Though a test and trace system is being introduced today, scientists have already warned that it will prevent less than 15% of infections, given the large numbers still infected.
And travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions. There are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel. Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine. Perhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on. But when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK. • David Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford",2020-05-28 05:00:22+00:00,100926,2
101152,commentisfree/2020/may/27/privatisation-uk-disatrous-coronavirus-response-ppe-care-homes-corporate-power-public-policy,Opinion,Tory privatisation is at the heart of the UK's disastrous coronavirus response | George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/privatisation-uk-disatrous-coronavirus-response-ppe-care-homes-corporate-power-public-policy,"Amid the smog of lies and contradictions, there is one question we should never stop asking: why has the government of the United Kingdom so spectacularly failed to defend people’s lives? Why has “this fortress built by Nature for herself against infection”, as Shakespeare described our islands, succumbed to a greater extent than any other European nation to a foreseeable and containable pandemic? Part of the answer is that the government knowingly and deliberately stood down crucial parts of its emergency response system. Another part is that, when it did at last seek to mobilise the system, crucial bits of the machine immediately fell off. There is a consistent reason for the multiple, systemic failures the pandemic has exposed: the intrusion of corporate power into public policy. Privatisation, commercialisation, outsourcing and offshoring have severely compromised the UK’s ability to respond to a crisis. Take, for example, the lethal failures to provide protective clothing, masks and other equipment (PPE) to health workers. A report by the campaigning group We Own It seeks to explain why so many doctors, nurses and other hospital workers have died unnecessarily of Covid-19. It describes a system built around the needs not of health workers or patients, but of corporations and commercial contracts: a system that could scarcely be better designed for failure. Four layers of commercial contractors, each rich with opportunities for profit-making, stand between doctors and nurses and the equipment they need. These layers are then fragmented into 11 tottering, uncoordinated supply chains, creating an almost perfect formula for chaos. Among the many weak links in these chains are consultancy companies like Deloitte, whose farcical attempts to procure emergency supplies of PPE have been fiercely criticised by both manufacturers and health workers. At the end of the chains are manufacturing companies, some of which have mysteriously been granted monopolies on the supply of essential equipment. These private monopolies have either failed to meet their contracts, or provided defective gear to the entire NHS, like the 15m protective goggles and the planeload of useless surgical gowns that had to be recalled. Instead of stockpiling supplies, as emergency preparedness demands, companies in these chains have been using just-in-time production systems, whose purpose is to cut their costs by minimising stocks. Their minimised systems could not be scaled up fast enough to meet the shortfall. Where there should be a smooth, coordinated, accountable programme, there’s opacity, byzantine complexity and total chaos. So much for the efficiencies of privatisation. The pandemic has also exposed the privatised care system as catastrophically unfit and ill-prepared. In 1993, 95% of care at home was provided publicly by local authorities. Now, almost all of it – and almost all residential care – is provided by private companies. Even before the pandemic, the system was falling apart, as many care companies, unable to balance the needs of their patients with the demands of their shareholders, collapsed, often with disastrous consequences. Now we discover just how dangerous their commercial imperatives have become, as the drive to make care profitable has created a fragmented, incoherent system, answerable sometimes to offshore owners, that fails to meet basic standards, and employs harassed workers on zero-hour contracts. If there is one thing we have learnt from this pandemic, it’s the need for a publicly owned, publicly run National Care Service – the care equivalent of the NHS. It could all become much worse, due to another effect of corporate power. A report by the Corporate Europe Observatory shows how law firms are exploring the possibility of suing governments for the measures they have taken to stop the pandemic. Many trade treaties contain a provision called “investor state dispute settlement”. This enables corporations to sue governments in opaque offshore tribunals, for any policies that might affect their “future anticipated profits”. So when governments, in response to coronavirus, have imposed travel restrictions, or requisitioned hotels, or instructed companies to produce medical equipment or limit the price of drugs, the companies could sue them for the loss of the money they might otherwise have made. When the UK government commandeers private hospitals or the Spanish government prevents evictions by landlords, and stops water and electricity companies from cutting off destitute customers, they could be open to international legal challenge. These measures, which override democracy, have already hampered attempts by many governments, particularly of poorer nations, to protect their people from disasters. They urgently need to be rescinded. The effectiveness of our health system is also threatened by the trade treaty the UK government hopes to sign with the US. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto that “the NHS is not on the table” in the trade talks. But they have already broken their accompanying promise, “we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”. Earlier this month, they voted that measure out of the agriculture bill. US companies are aggressively demanding access to the NHS. The talks will be extremely complex and incomprehensible to almost everyone. There will be plenty of opportunities to give them what they want while fooling voters. Boris Johnson’s central mission, overseen by Dominic Cummings, is to break down all barriers between government and the power of money. It is to allow private interests to intrude into the very heart of government, while marginalising the civil service. This helps to explain why Johnson is so reluctant to let Cummings go. The disasters of the past few weeks hint at the likely results. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",2020-05-27 05:00:21+00:00,101153,2
101262,commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-lockdown-rules-coronavirus,Opinion,Cummings' actions have taken the ‘we' out of keeping to lockdown rules | Stephen Reicher,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-lockdown-rules-coronavirus,"During his rose garden press conference, Dominic Cummings was asked if his trip to Durham had undermined government public health messaging. I hope not, he replied. Later, Boris Johnson was asked the same question. His response was more definitive: no one in No 10 has undermined the messaging. I hope they are right. For this matters. If people stop listening to what the government asks them to do and if they stop adhering to coronavirus measures then the number of infections will rise and more people will die. But I cannot be as certain or as optimistic as the prime minister and his adviser. All that we know about adherence (knowledge that behavioural scientists have repeatedly stressed to the government during the pandemic) suggests that damage has been done. First, for all the complexities of Cummings’ story, the bottom line is very simple. While millions of people up and down the land faced agonising personal circumstances and decided to stick with lockdown, Cummings did not. He went to Durham at the very time his government was insisting “stay at home, don’t travel”. He went to a beauty spot at the very time his government was insisting we avoid them. And nothing has happened to him. Instead, his actions have been endorsed. At the very least, that gives the appearance of “one rule for them, another for us” (possibly the best way of corroding trust in authority and adherence to the rules). And Cummings more than anyone else understands the importance of appearance in politics. Second, the one thing that has carried us through the pandemic so far has been an emergent sense of community. This “we” feeling has been critical in getting people to adhere to the restrictions, even when they personally were not at risk. It has been critical to all the volunteering and neighbourhood support that has helped us through hardship. It is the most valuable asset we have in a crisis. But the most notable thing about Cummings’ rose garden performance was that “we” was nowhere to be found. It was all about “I”. His explanation was entirely about his judgments as an individual, his decisions, his personal concerns. At no point was there any thought to the impact of his actions on others. Still worse, in his defence of Cummings on Sunday, the prime minister seemed to endorse the idea that, when the going gets tough, it is fine to rely on your own judgments – and fine to follow your individual “instincts”. In effect, Johnson’s defence of Cummings turned an issue of communal responsibility into an issue of individual preference. Had everyone done that – had we all put so much energy into thinking about loopholes that served our personal circumstances rather than thinking about the impact of our actions on others – then lockdown would not have worked, the infection would still be raging and the NHS would have been overwhelmed. As we come out of lockdown these issues become, if anything, even more important. It isn’t that the infection has gone away. Rather we are now in a position, due to past sacrifices by the many, to use more targeted strategies against coronavirus. But these are dependent on us all maintaining physical distancing, increasing hygiene standards, revealing our contacts if infected and observing quarantine if contacted. All of these measures are personally inconvenient. Often it will be easier to ignore them. They will only work if we continue to act together and for each other. I hope this will happen. I hope people will continue to demonstrate the remarkable solidarity they have shown so far. I hope the collective spirit won’t be damaged. But this sorry affair doesn’t help, and the more they defend themselves, the more our top politician and his top adviser demonstrate that they don’t even appreciate what the problems are. • Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, an adviser to the UK and Scottish governments on coronavirus and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews",2020-05-26 14:17:33+00:00,101263,2
101279,commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-scientific-boris-johnson-adviser-game-theory,Opinion,How has Cummings harmed the fight against coronavirus? Here's the scientific answer | Rowland Kao,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-scientific-boris-johnson-adviser-game-theory,"Much of the attention over Dominic Cummings’ family trip from London to Durham has focused on the moral and legal questions. Did his actions obey the letter of lockdown restrictions, which require every person to stay close to home except under severe personal circumstance? And with these restrictions placing an enormous toll on families around the country, was it morally right?
With questions still remaining over some of his assertions, these remain important issues; but even more important is the potential impact of his actions on the behaviour of others. There is evidence that, even with the lockdown rules mostly in place, people are now moving about more frequently, even in the most heavily hit areas of the country. Partly this change is a consequence of people having a better understanding of the restrictions, and therefore pushing the boundaries. Partly it is likely due to a desire to go out in the warm weather. In Germany, which is well ahead of the UK in controlling coronavirus and easing lockdown, local clusters of infection have arisen due to the resumption of some pre-pandemic activities. This is an almost inevitable outcome of easing restrictions. While that easing is both justified and necessary, it must be done slowly and with caution. If normal behaviours resume too rapidly, there is potential for the number of Covid-19 cases to increase while our control over its spread remains fragile. In this context, Cummings’ actions have the potential to impede Britain’s recovery from the pandemic. Intuitively we know that influential people in the public eye can have a profound impact on the behaviour of others. Understanding all this is the domain of game theory, which shows us that when each person simply chooses what seems best for them, the outcome can be terrible for the group. Ironically, Cummings himself has written extensively on this theory. Game theory has been central to the work of many Nobel prize-winners in economics, and it is now widely recognised as important in subjects ranging from evolution to public health, most notably in studying the voluntary uptake of vaccines. This is particularly relevant given the number of “anti-vaxxers” resisting the possibility of being vaccinated against Covid-19. The success of vaccination relies on enough people taking part to induce herd immunity; and while there may be a small risk associated with taking the vaccine, that risk is outstripped by the benefits of eradicating the disease. However, if too few people take up the vaccine, the benefit of herd immunity is lost, leading to greater infection. What game theory tells us is that mass behaviour has a tipping point: below it, that behaviour is isolated and can ultimately die out; but above it, the behaviour can spread rapidly through the entire population. Critical to all this is the concept of trust. If a positive behaviour change is required – such as abiding by the lockdown rules – individuals must trust that enough others will do so to make their own sacrifices worthwhile. The exhortations to stick together – to “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives” – are a real-world expression of this concept. Each individual action is likely to be small; but each is important because it also influences other people’s behaviour. If we see others obeying a given set of rules, we tend to do the same. This can be very difficult when we do not know people who have had Covid-19, or have not seen how serious it can be. But if even a small number of individuals act with a very different set of values and priorities, it can result in a cascade of selfish behaviour. The combination of social contact patterns and selfish behaviour can have a profound influence on the ability of a disease to spread, even when those individuals starting the cascade have no more inherent influence than anyone else. There is some evidence from the US that this social connectivity has been important in determining how people adhere to lockdown restrictions. The impact of public figures acting in their personal interest can therefore be disastrous – not because of the individual disease risks they pose, but because of their potential, as a public example, to set off catastrophic behaviour change. We all hope that Britain has turned the tide against the coronavirus pandemic. However, with no immediate prospects for a vaccine, health services stretched and continued uncertainty over testing and tracing, that success remains fragile. While Cummings’ actions have the potential to undermine that success, what game theory tells us is that we are all influencers. In this sense, it is not only the needs of the many that matter more than the needs of the few, but their actions as well. We cannot change the past actions of others, but our own actions now and in the future are critical for the successful control of Covid-19.

101564,commentisfree/2020/may/25/pandemic-failings-centralised-state-councils-coronavirus,Opinion,The pandemic has exposed the failings of Britain's centralised state | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/pandemic-failings-centralised-state-councils-coronavirus,"And so it is that we reach a watershed point in the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, manifested in a tangle of stories all unified by vivid themes: power concentrated at the centre, a lack of meaningful checks and balances, and the exposure by incompetence and arrogance of the mess beneath. Primary schools are meant to partly reopen next Monday, but many are in no position to do so; a test-and-tracing regime that should have materialised weeks ago is still frantically being assembled. And then along come the revelations of Dominic Cummings’s wanderings – ostensibly a tale of one man’s self-importance, but really the story of an unelected courtier whose influence and reputation speak volumes about how broken our system of government now is. One recurrent spectacle has defined the last couple of months: ministers, presumably egged on by their advisers, grandly issuing their edicts, only for people to insist that they simply do not match the reality on the ground. The schools story is one example; another was the shambolic and arrogant way that Boris Johnson announced the shift from “stay at home” to “stay alert”, and his call for droves of people to return to work. Watching the leaders of Wales and Scotland insist they had no input into the government’s change of message and then stick to their existing lockdowns was a stark reminder that the UK is continuing to fragment. In England, meanwhile, the council leaders and mayors who were suddenly faced with huge consequences for transport and public health had been caught on the hop. “No one in government thought it important to tell the cities who’d have to cope,” said the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, told me last week: “The first I knew about it was when I saw it on TV.” For the opening phase of the crisis, Forbes explained, he had joined a weekly conference call of council leaders and chief executives, addressed by Robert Jenrick, the communities and local government secretary. He is not the only figure from local government who has told me that the calls are now handled by more junior ministers, and are no longer weekly. A few days ago, I spoke to another city leader who said that long-awaited government guidance on arrangements for social care and help for businesses had finally arrived last Friday, ahead of the bank holiday weekend. He also expressed huge frustration about the issue that arguably highlights the shortcomings of our top-down system most glaringly: the supposed arrival of a “world-beating” testing and tracing system by next Monday, and the ongoing saga of how it will work and who will run it. On testing, rather than following the kind of devolved, pluralistic model that has worked so well in Germany, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has so far stuck to the usual centralised script, something exemplified by the drive-through testing centres contracted at speed to such private companies as Deloitte, Sodexo and Boots, and often situated in inappropriate locations. On its hobbling progress towards a system of contact tracing, the government at first followed much the same logic, attempting a centralised system of call centres involving such private companies as the outsourcing giant Serco, staffed by new recruits who had apparently been given the most cursory training. The councils who have the kind of forensic local knowledge and experience any tracing efforts will depend on were at first left in the dark. Then, less than three weeks before the system was meant to be in place, it was announced that the chief executive of Leeds city council had been made “national lead on tracing”, and that councils and their public health directors were to have a role after all. Throughout last week, senior people in city and local government were still telling me that though this sounded positive, they had no clear idea of what they were going to be asked to do. But on Friday afternoon, the government announced that councils would be working with Whitehall “to support test and trace services in their local communities” and “develop tailored outbreak control plans”. As one city leader told me, the announcement came at “one minute to midnight”. The £300m that was now allocated to English councils for the work was, he said, “completely pitiful”. The thinking at work was plain: seemingly in a fit of panic, the people who run cities, counties and boroughs had been belatedly tacked on to a plan that should have had them at its core all along. Perhaps the most painful thing was that this mistreatment was hardly a surprise: if councils are suddenly being praised by ministers, it hardly makes up for a decade of savage cuts to basic local services, an aspect of the Covid-19 crisis that is still overlooked. Which brings us to the subject too often obscured by the government’s convulsions: money. Two weeks ago, the Yorkshire Post reported on the prospect of “many of the 22 local authorities in the Yorkshire and the Humber region making a choreographed joint declaration that they have run out of money”. In Newcastle, Forbes told me the city council now faced an in-year financial gap of £45.5m. When ministers and their cheerleaders announce this or that funding boost and insist there will be no return to austerity, it is worth bearing in mind that austerity is still an ongoing reality for large chunks of the country. Just about every aspect of our current national impasse proves that the old centralised game is up, and that England needs a new constitutional settlement. This does not strike me as a left/right issue, unless you are the kind of Tory who thinks that the neglect and outright destruction of local government ought to be a necessary part of your politics. Power needs to be taken from the centre and dispersed: the future needs to be founded on a huge boost to councils’ share of the tax take, the devolution of everything from health to transport, and fully localised responses to any future emergencies. If we do not begin this revolution soon, we will carry on bumbling from one crisis to the next, as Whitehall and Westminster fall into more scandal and disgrace and the commands barked from on high continue to fade into white noise. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist",2020-05-25 06:00:44+00:00,101565,67
101580,commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign,Opinion,The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone. Why did it take such a fight? | Nesrine Malik,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign,"The first two doctors to die of Covid-19 on the NHS frontline were born in Sudan. In the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, there is a loan shark. Until last week, junior doctors with job offers in the UK represented a reliable income stream for him. The work visas they needed came with a host of conditions, but meeting those criteria counted for nothing unless they paid, upfront, an immigration health surcharge of £400 a year for every year of their work permit, duplicated for every member of their family if they had one. Being recent graduates, most applicants had only pennies to their name. So the loan shark thrived, demanding an interest payment in advance, before personally entering his credit card details into the online application form. His business may now be in trouble. On Thursday, the British government gave in to mounting pressure and exempted migrant NHS staff from the surcharge. This wasn’t an easily won concession. Cancelling the surcharge before the anger had reached its own backbenches could have been an early and obvious win. But that’s not how this government, or its Home Office, works. The surcharge is (not was, as it is still paid by non-NHS migrants, many on low incomes and with few public advocates) not only outrageously costly, it is also immoral. Migrants pay taxes and national insurance contributions. Subjecting them to an additional charge to use an NHS they have already contributed to amounts to exploitation. The fact that the government will not offer an exemption for people on low incomes, or deviate from its demand to pay in one lump sum, is a familiar feature of Home Office fee design. The policy is to put immigrants on the spot and extract as much as possible from them. On the other side of these fees there are jobs, training opportunities, university offers, spouses, partners and other loved ones to join. If you’re in the country already, the downside of failing to pay such fees renders them close to extortion. Refusing to stump up means having to take your life apart and leaving the country. What’ll it be: your money or your life? I and many friends and family members have often had to make these kinds of decisions over the years. In the middle of a long, chaotic and insulting immigration experience you put your dignity, mental health and financial stability on the one hand; and the intricate, rich life you have built in this country on the other. The scales just about balance. This is what the government bets on. As a result, it has built an immigration system that is geared not towards what is fair, but what it can get away with. And that is a lot. If one looks back over the last decade, two policies, austerity and the hostile environment, have defined the Conservative political agenda. The party not only managed to drive them through undiluted, it also spun these policies’ failures, to achieve prosperity or a reduction in immigration numbers, as success. It is no surprise then that it took such a fight to convince the government to exempt NHS staff from the surcharge even as they were fighting a pandemic. Its commitment to the policy was never about money: numbers suggests that NHS staff contributions only bring in a measly £35m a year (not Boris Johnson’s deliberately inflated number of almost a billion). The Tory party’s own MPs and peers condemned it. Politically, the surcharge put the government to the right of Ukip and at odds with the Daily Mail. But a habit forged over a decade is hard to quit overnight. The political software of nimble review and reform does not exist in the Home Office. In fact, it is inimical to the smooth running of the hostile environment, which is a complex policy infrastructure that is built for inflexibility. Combine that with this new government’s rapid centralisation, fondness for unsubtle apparatchiks like Priti Patel, disdain for the civil service, plus a dash of incompetence, and you end up with an administration that responds to nothing but public shaming. Increasingly, the only way to get the Conservatives to ditch unethical policies is to provoke national outrage. The victims of the policies have to suffer, and then drag their pain and anger into the public realm and petition for mercy. Whether it is the suspension of Windrush deportations, free parking for NHS doctors, extending indefinite leave to remain to the families of all NHS staff, or this latest concession, the government only changed course when it became too embarrassing not to. There is no moral compass, no sense of responsibility over lives in its care, just a cynical cost-benefit analysis of which policies are worth the harassment in the media and at the dispatch box and which are not. But we get them to move. One win at a time. It does mean, though, that we can only focus on one injustice at a time. The NHS surcharge may have saved junior doctors from a loan shark in Khartoum. But with every victory a question hangs: what about the others trapped in the latticework of the government’s meanness and incompetence, suffering in ways that will probably never come to light? • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",2020-05-25 05:00:42+00:00,101581,16

We must: • Revalue care: nurses and carers deserve a pay rise, not just a round of applause. We should reverse marketisation of our NHS, and better integrate physical, mental and social care. • Reduce inequality: present levels of inequality benefit no one, fragmenting society, distorting democracy and overburdening care systems. We must reject austerity measures, house the UK’s homeless and consider implementing a universal basic income. • Get to grips with the climate and ecological emergency, by “baking in” good lockdown practices, adopting strict year-by-year carbon budgets in line with the UN’s 1.5 degree target, and localising production, consumption and travel where possible. • Set up an independent public inquiry on the handling of the pandemic, to make sure the lessons are learned. • Create a UK Citizens’ Assembly for the Future, selected at random, to counter the short-termism, lack of representation and bias of our political institutions. This body would work alongside parliament, focusing on longer-term issues such as disaster planning, institutional reform and the low carbon transition.

Professor Colin Richards Spark Bridge, Cumbria Ave María Your description of María Branyas, (“Spain’s great survivor”, News) who “outlived the 1918 flu epidemic and two world wars” is oddly ethnocentric, since Spain was not a belligerent in either world war. Her achievement, of course, was to survive the Spanish civil war. Alan Knight Oxford Rule 1: know your brief As Andrew Anthony writes, “few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds” (“Who’d be a health secretary?”, the New Review). Lack of first-hand experience of their remit is the rule rather than the exception for secretaries of state; this, combined with ideological bias, makes them vulnerable to the loudest and most persuasive lobbyists, and thus more likely to make poor policy decisions. There are endless examples of these ministers alienating “their” workforce (Michael Gove as education secretary achieved this within days of being appointed). Surely it is time that a sine qua non qualification for becoming secretary of state is to have spent a significant period working in that field? This, combined with good management and leadership, would encourage confidence in the workforce, and, crucially, the quality of policymaking would be much improved. Max Fishel Bromley, Greater London Truly a party of the right Barbara Ellen rightly labels Nadine Dorries a “disgrace” for spreading far-right lies about Keir Starmer on Twitter (“Dorries, you’re a disgrace for spreading fake news”, Comment). That three Conservative MPs retweeted such divisive filth – before refusing to apologise – demonstrates just how extreme some Tory MPs are. The Conservatives might have been a centre-right party a decade ago, but that’s no longer the case. The cabinet is full of ideological rightwing populists who have no grasp of reality, and the backbenches, similarly, contain many rightwing nationalists. French Wikipedia lists the British Conservative party as “right wing” (droite), not “centre right”. While Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson remain at the top of the party, such an assertion is not wrong. Sebastian Monblat Sutton, London The plot thickens Regarding your article “Did Agatha Christie ‘borrow’ the plot for this genre-bending novel… from Norway?” (News): a more likely source was Israel Zangwill’s novel, The Big Bow Mystery, published as a serial in 1891 and as a book in 1892. I won’t give away the plot... Dr Eldrid Herrington University of Cambridge The price of a US trade deal William Keegan (“Brexit: a strange idea derailed by our strange times”, Business) points out that our government seems happy to give up £112bn from our departure from the EU in exchange for a £3.4bn gain from a US deal, presumably as a price worth paying for not being required to accept a single EU rule. But, leaving aside the probability that the EU will in due course obtain a better deal with the US than the UK could, has it occurred to our international trade secretary that all trade deals involve give and take, and that the US will undoubtedly require some “give” by the UK in the form of accepting US rules on, for example, food standards? Alan Pavelin Chislehurst, Kent Lavatorial language I was startled to read that Jay Rayner uses a “gosunder” in his kitchen on a regular basis (The Happy Eater, Observer Food Monthly). Where I grew up in Derbyshire, this was the name of an entirely different vessel. My grandmother had them under the beds in the house where she lived from her marriage in 1933 until her late 80s, as her landlord did not see fit to upgrade her outside toilet in all those years. A rearrangement of doors by my grandad 50-odd years ago meant that a visit to the loo no longer involved the open air, but even so, a gosunder was preferable to traipsing downstairs through a house with no central heating, even with the ritual of emptying its contents in the morning.

101832,commentisfree/2020/may/23/how-the-plandemic-conspiracy-theory-took-hold,Opinion,How the 'Plandemic' conspiracy theory took hold,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/23/how-the-plandemic-conspiracy-theory-took-hold,"To have one viral sensation, Oscar Wilde might have said, is unfortunate. But to have two smacks of carelessness. And that’s what we have. The first is Covid-19, about which much printer’s ink has already been spilled. The second is Plandemic, a 26-minute “documentary” video featuring Dr Judy Mikovits, a former research scientist and inveterate conspiracy theorist who blames the coronavirus outbreak on big pharma, Bill Gates and the World Health Organization. She also claims that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which is headed by Dr Anthony Fauci) buried her research showing vaccines weaken people’s immune systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Just to round off the accusations, Mikovits claims that wearing masks is dangerous because it “literally activates your own virus”. And, if proof were needed that the pharma-Gates-scientific-elite cabal were out to get her, the leading journal Science in 2011 retracted a paper by her on a supposed link between a retrovirus and chronic fatigue syndrome that it had accepted in 2009. The video went online on 4 May when its maker, Mikki Willis, a hitherto little-known film producer, posted it to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and a separate website set up to share the video. For three days it built up a head of steam on Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories, many of which linked to the video on YouTube. By 11 May it had been viewed more than 8m times on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and had generated countless other posts on websites and social media. Later that day YouTube, Vimeo and Facebook took down the video, and in theory it disappeared from the internet – only of course it hadn’t, in the time-honoured way of subversive material in the networked world. The cognitive pathogen had escaped into the wild and was spreading virally.
As it did so, a number of journalists and network scientists began to map the route by which this niche obsession made it into the big time. A New York Times team traced it back to a Facebook page dedicated to QAnon, a rightwing conspiracy theory, which has 25,000 members, headed with the clickbait injunction “Exclusive Content, Must Watch”. The video went from being viewed directly on YouTube to people linking out to it on Facebook, Twitter and other social media channels, with each link increasing the possibility that it would make the next big jump. On the afternoon of 5 May, the link was shared by a celebrity medic who had appeared on Oprah and had half a million followers on Facebook. Later that evening Plandemic popped up on a large-scale political page on Facebook. The page, reports the NYT, “was for Reopen Alabama, which has over 36,000 members and was part of the movement by Americans who wanted to lift shelter-in-place orders. Once the video appeared on that page, which was linked to dozens of other Reopen America groups, it quickly began spreading to the pages of those other groups in a kind of forceful multiplier effect.” The next day it was shared by a Republican politician in Ohio with her 20,000 Facebook followers. “If you watch ANYTHING on my page,” she wrote, “it needs to be this.” This then brought the video into the Republican mainstream, which meant that it was everywhere in semi-polite rightwing society. The NYT reconstruction of Plandemic’s meteoric rise was complemented by the different approach taken by Erin Gallagher, a social media analyst who used analytical and graphical tools often used by data scientists. She looked for public Facebook posts containing the keywords “Plandemic” or “Judy Mikovits” and then started to draw the network graphs that emerged from those data sets. The most interesting thing about the resulting social media networks is the centrality of certain conspiracist Facebook pages and groups and YouTube channels in them. For example, QAnon looms large and central. So do Collective Action Against Bill Gates, ChemtrailsGlobalSkywatch, Fall of the Cabal, Truth Revolution, and even our old friend David Icke and his YouTube channel. This confirms something we’ve known since at least 2016, namely that conspiracy theory sites are the most powerful engines of disinformation around. And when they have a medical conspiracy theory to work with, then they are really in business. “Medical and health conspiracy theories do well,” said Prof Eric Oliver, a scholar who studies them, “because oftentimes they’re not explicitly ideological in the way that other conspiracy theories are. They tend to cross ideological domains.” In public opinion surveys in the US, he found that 40% of those polled agree with the proposition that “the Food and Drug Administration has been deliberately withholding natural cures for cancer because of secret pressure from the pharmaceutical industry.” And support for it comes from across the American political spectrum. All of which suggests that when a Covid-19 vaccine does eventually arrive, conspiracy theorists will have a field day. Assuming they haven’t all died of the virus first.

102012,commentisfree/2020/may/22/fertility-clinics-reopening-patients-anxiety-coronavirus,Opinion,"Fertility clinics are reopening, but for many patients this won't end the anxiety | Zeynep Gurtin",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/fertility-clinics-reopening-patients-anxiety-coronavirus,"As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all UK fertility clinics were required to close their doors in early April. Fertility specialists had to inform their patients, some of whom had been on waiting lists for up to a year and others who were midway through drug cycles, that their treatments were going to be delayed or paused for an indefinite period of time. Shirin Khanjani, a consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at University College Hospital, who underwent retraining to be redeployed to the NHS Covid-19 frontline, says these were extremely difficult conversations, and that the news was distressing for many of her patients. She explains: “They have waited for months, if not years, to have their treatment and this break in proceedings may have had a damaging impact on their emotional and physical wellbeing.” Although the clinic closures were an understandable part of coronavirus restrictions, and a necessary measure to protect NHS capacity, they left many patients facing uncertain futures. How long would men and women have to wait until they could have a chance to attempt conception? What would be the fate of those patients who found themselves “ageing out” and missing their opportunity for much-needed NHS funding for their treatments? And how about those who were told their fertility was already on a steep decline, who now feared their odds of a successful outcome might irrevocably diminish as lockdown progressed into months?
A stressful and rollercoaster experience at the best of times, the pandemic has exacerbated fertility patients’ emotional turmoil, by amplifying the already overwhelming feelings of uncertainty, lack of control and isolation that are often associated with infertility and IVF treatment. As Philomena da Silva, a psychologist working in a fertility clinic told me; “The journey towards parenthood as a fertility patient can be a long, emotionally heightened and precarious experience in itself, and these feelings seemed to increase during the isolation period.” Da Silva has continued to speak to patients over the telephone since lockdown began, and some fertility counsellors have been running online counselling and daily support sessions through Zoom or Facebook. But despite these offerings, for many men and women the unforeseen disruption to their fertility plans has been heartbreaking. As such, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority’s (HFEA) recent announcement that clinics could apply to reopen as of 11 May was generally welcomed by both professionals and patients across the fertility industry. In order to reopen for treatment, clinics will be required to meet the revised general direction and to reconfigure their services to ensure the safety of staff and patients, including compliance with government guidance on social distancing. However, the HFEA does not require clinics to reopen, and it is likely that some will take much longer than others to do so. As with much of the guidance around the transition out of lockdown, here too a great deal of confusion reigns and questions remain unanswered. What will the new requirements mean for the numbers of patients who can be treated at any one time, and how might this impact waiting lists? Will all clinics reopen in a matter of weeks or will some choose to take much longer, depending on local conditions and staff shortages? Can patients who were receiving treatments in clinics that remain closed transfer to alternative clinics? As yet, we simply don’t know. Plus, part of the new requirements will be for patients to actively consent to having treatment while there is a risk that they could contract Covid-19 either during the treatment or if successful, during pregnancy, adding yet another layer of potential anxiety. Some patients are, of course, optimistic and eager to resume their treatment plans as soon as possible. Others are feeling worried or cautious, concerned about a huge range of issues, from how to safely negotiate travel to their soon-to-be-open clinic, to balancing newly emerging care responsibilities or remote working arrangements with the taxing demands of a treatment cycle. And then there are those who are facing additional financial burdens, having lost significant income or even their jobs during this pandemic, and who find themselves having to recalculate the considerable expense of fertility treatment.
Sally (not her real name), who was about to start her third cycle of IVF with her husband just before the clinics closed, says the lockdown has been an “incubator of frustrations” for her. She describes her experience of “still” being childless at 37 after six years of marriage as a source of loneliness and perceived exclusion. Over the past two months in particular, she says, it has created “a growing chasm” between her and the friends who’ve variously complained about the impossibilities of home schooling young children and relished the creative activities they finally had time to enjoy as a family. “It’s been quite painful to see all that on social media actually,” she says. “Everyone is doing mum challenges and posting photos of their children, and it kind of rubs it in your face.” For Sally, the reopening of clinics is good news; it gives her an opportunity to try to join the parenthood club she so much wants to become a part of. But it won’t be treatment as usual, and she is yet to find out what new measures her clinic has put in place, or whether she might have to wait longer if they can only treat a smaller number of patients each month. There is, of course, also the question of what might happen to newly reopened clinics if there is a second peak or an increase in the R number. One thing seems fairly clear: fertility patients will require additional medical, emotional and psychological care as part of their treatment during this pandemic, and clinics must build robust support systems as part of their reopening strategies. • Zeynep Gurtin is the lead researcher on a new research project organised by the Institute for Women’s Health at UCL exploring the impact of clinic closures and the coronavirus pandemic on fertility patients’ lives, relationships and feelings.

102023,commentisfree/2020/may/22/sweden-u-turn-controversial-covid-19-strategy,Opinion,Why Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its controversial Covid-19 strategy | Tae Hoon Kim,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/sweden-u-turn-controversial-covid-19-strategy,"Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The figures are also much higher than Sweden’s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306. International observers and critics within Sweden blame these depressing figures on its controversial Covid-19 strategy. Unlike the rest of Europe, or what is often cited as the exemplar nation of South Korea, Sweden has not imposed any lockdowns nor carried out mass testing. Its policy has been to slow the spread of the virus by exhorting its citizens to practise voluntary social distancing. Some restrictions have been enforced, such as a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people, and a stipulation that drinks can only be served on seated tables as opposed to bars. Everyday life in Sweden is not the same as before. There are fewer people in shopping centres and public transport. Working from home has become the new normal for those who can. But people continue to socialise outdoors freely, while primary schools, hairdressers and shopping centres remain open. But despite the high number of deaths, about 70% of Swedes support their government’s approach. In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies – but not on the strategy itself. Why is this so? One explanation that has been aired frequently points to the high degree of trust between government agencies and citizens. The argument is that the level of government transparency and the state’s service-mindedness has created an environment where the people trust their government and experts.
Whereas this might explain the lack of opposition, it is far from exhaustive. For example, Norway, Denmark and Finland are also known as high-trust societies. But all three have imposed far more restrictive measures, ranging from lockdowns to declaring a national emergency. Second, the fact that some of the people most affected by the high death rate are from the poorest immigrant groups, such as the Somali community, whose voice is not always well represented in the media, goes against this image of a universally trusting and transparent society. Perhaps another explanation is that Sweden has a very different way of perceiving the current crisis. Instead of seeing it as a national emergency or a fight against an “invisible enemy”, there seems to be a tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem. It is viewed as something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts, rather than an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties for the sake of national security. Indeed, whenever a non-scientific expert such as me criticises the Swedish strategy, the response has often been that I am not an expert. This is where Sweden is unique, something that may be attributable to its history. The country has not experienced a national emergency or crisis for more than 100 years. Since around the Swedish general strike of 1909, it has not seen any profound social conflicts, for example the miners’ strike in Britain, or a civil war, as in Spain or Finland. Any foreigner who has lived in Sweden will know how conflict-averse Swedish people seem to be. Furthermore, Sweden has not engaged in any armed disputes since the 1810s. This is in contrast to Denmark and Norway, which were occupied by Germany in the second world war, and Finland, invaded by the USSR in the same period. A rallying cry of unity in the face of national adversity isn’t part of the collective cultural fabric in Sweden. This lack of experience with handling national crises goes some way to explaining why there is a technocratic and dispassionate outlook to Covid-19, as opposed to a sense of urgency. It is also why the public health agency in Sweden seems to have few qualms about “herd immunity”. Whereas other countries see it as a dangerous national experiment, Swedish health officials regard it more as a type of medical prescription. It might not be 100% effective and some deaths might occur, as in any medical situation. But in the long run, it could work in mitigating the negative effects of the virus, without mass social disruption. It is for this reason that the denial by the Swedish government and health officials that it is actually pursuing “herd immunity” seem so halfhearted, a rebuttal to critical foreign press rather than its citizens. For a foreigner living in Sweden like me, it is not entirely reassuring. How long Sweden will continue with this policy is difficult to ascertain. But as long as Covid-19 is seen in this light, and it looks as if it will, a U-turn seems unlikely. • Tae Hoon Kim is a South Korean geopolitical and economic analyst based in Stockholm, Sweden",2020-05-22 13:00:25+00:00,102024,2
102103,commentisfree/2020/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-covid-19-dilemma-when-best-laid-plans-go-awry,Opinion,The Guardian view on Johnson's Covid-19 dilemma: when best laid plans go awry | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-covid-19-dilemma-when-best-laid-plans-go-awry,"In 2017, the historian Walter Scheidel proposed that the “four horsemen” – warfare, revolution, state collapse and pandemics – had been the great levellers in history, reshaping societies by flattening economic inequalities. His thesis was not new, but his work meticulously argued that such events were necessary conditions for disruptive transformations. Revolutions are not inevitable. A short, sharp shock may change society in the short term, but leave it largely intact. Underlying Boris Johnson’s speech on Tuesday is an acknowledgement that the coronavirus pandemic is potentially a Scheidelian shock that could take society in a completely different direction to the one he wants to drive it to. The more prolonged and severe the crisis becomes, the stronger the urge for equality and the larger the transformation needed. This perhaps explains why Mr Johnson made a speech now about “Britain after Covid” and why he said he wanted life to return to normal next year. He is hoping perhaps that the long-established patterns of reform rather than revolution would reassert themselves and he could muddle along. The danger for Mr Johnson is that coronavirus defines his government and forces him to deal with the yawning gaps in society that will be thrown into sharper relief the longer the Covid-19 crisis continues. In his speech the prime minister chose to avoid the big questions of the age, preferring to dwell on the mundane. Rather than slaying one of the giants on the road to a post-coronavirus society – dealing with growing wealth inequality; a climate emergency; how to bring a fractured United Kingdom back together – Mr Johnson focused on the pygmy of planning rules that “prevent” housebuilding. Housing is a pressing issue, but red tape is a brake on property developer profits, not on the speed at which homes are put up. In its current guise, conservatism is more than just a front for corporate interests. Mr Johnson rose to power because conservatism was divided by a conflict between party factions. He won an internal battle to define what the new order in conservatism will look like. But the prime minister has not won the battle of what the new intellectual order will look like. What is undeniable is that the state is growing. The economy has required infusions of government money to keep it afloat. The pandemic has meant frontline public services cannot be easily starved of cash. The state has shown a mighty capacity to insure people against economic risk and is underwriting billions in loans to companies. All this before the economy has to absorb the shock of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson’s speech reveals that it’s not yet clear whether he can sustain a new ruling bloc in electoral terms, given the impact of the crisis on the economy. Mr Johnson wants to secure the “red wall” seats he won in December with fiscal expansion. But he risks alienating the Tory pro-business base that craves tax cuts and his libertarian supporters who resist the social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. A more activist state can produce a fairer settlement. There’s a tendency to underestimate the public’s tack towards collectivism but, equally, an inclination to overestimate the ease with which the state can shift direction. Gavin Kelly, who worked in Downing Street under Gordon Brown, has warned perceptively not to “underestimate the power of continuity”. A paradigm shift can happen when dominant beliefs no longer explain the way the world is working. But for this to occur, the case for change has to be made and won.",2020-06-30 18:00:08+00:00,102104,67
102141,commentisfree/2020/jun/30/leicester-local-lockdown,Opinion,In Leicester we have always felt left behind – this local lockdown proves it | Rob Palk,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/30/leicester-local-lockdown,"On a traffic island to the west of Leicester, my adopted city, a small replica of the Statue of Liberty stands and guards our freedoms. A plaque explains that she was not placed there out of pro-American feelings, but as a gesture by the manufacturer of liberty bodices, which once had factories nearby. I walked past the statue this morning after hearing the news that Leicester would return to local lockdown as the rest of the UK opened up from Saturday. When I got home, I saw a post on Facebook suggesting that outbreaks of coronavirus in the city can be traced to the factories that sustain Leicester’s now diminished rag trade. And the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, Andrew Bridgen, has said the garment industry was partially to blame for the outbreak. Small, non-unionised, heavily staffed by non-English speakers: these factories make a good scapegoat, but few of us will ever know the truth about why Leicester became a hotspot for Covid-19. Still, with information in short supply, people invent their own. For the past few weeks, I’ve been awaiting news of when I’ll be allowed to visit my partner’s house. We live separately; during the lockdown, when we’ve relied on the company of housemates and have been deprived of much contact beyond a Regency-style constitutional walk, we’ve counted the days until home visits are permitted. When the government announced that old freedoms would return from 4 July, we exchanged ecstatic texts. A few mornings later, I woke to a message from my mum informing me that Leicester might be facing a fresh outbreak of coronavirus cases. “I doubt they’ll sort it out in time,” I replied, “it’s not like there’s been great organisation so far.” Still, I started to keep my eye out for reports. My partner, who works in libraries, mentioned she’d heard talk of a local lockdown. No one seemed to know exactly what this entailed. I stopped planning a celebration for 4 July. The was more confusion than clarity in the week before the lockdown was announced. One moment the home secretary, Priti Patel, was suggesting that Leicester was definitely facing lockdown, the next our mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, was saying it was the first he’d heard of it. Soulsby reportedly said he’d received an email in the small hours with information about the lockdown, but said he had been unable to access the data to assess the situation himself. I found myself hoping guiltily for official incompetence to save us from more time indoors. Months of bored isolation had to come to an end. Rumours began to swirl about which parts of the city were infected. The north, the east; young people, old. Some places had never closed down – others were about to.
When the first wave of lockdown ended, people no longer walked in defensive, hunched-up shuffles. The streets were quieter than before the lockdown, the meadows emptier of people doing their daily exercise, but people ambled along as though they were no longer at risk. Cyclists started using the roads again. Today on my morning stroll, it felt as though paranoia had set in. Leicester was closing again before it had really opened. I spoke to one shop assistant who said he was waiting to hear from his manager about whether to come to work next week. He had been told nothing about any plans for a local furlough scheme (it has now been confirmed that there will be one). My partner was at work preparing for libraries to be re-opened. They were still waiting for official confirmation this wouldn’t be needed. No one seems to be in charge. Leicester is poor, in some parts shockingly so. It has a multiethnic population with large groups of people who are at heightened risk from the virus. It has factories that have stayed open and workers who travel to them by bus. We have an inconvenient habit of voting Labour. If anywhere was going to suffer, it would be Leicester. For now, we sit tight in rooms we’ve grown tired of, missing our loved ones and jumping at any news. It can only be a matter of weeks, we tell ourselves. Leicester has always felt left behind. It took coronavirus to make that a matter of fact. • Rob Palk is the author of Animal Lovers",2020-06-30 16:04:47+00:00,102142,2
102246,commentisfree/2020/jun/30/covid-19-global-health-crisis-solutions-americas-india-africa,Opinion,The latest figures are a wake-up call: the global Covid-19 crisis isn't close to over | Adam Tooze,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/30/covid-19-global-health-crisis-solutions-americas-india-africa,"It took more than three months for the world to record 1 million cases of Covid-19. The latest 1 million cases were clocked up in a week, taking the total to more than 10 million. On Sunday 28 June, the world recorded more than 190,000 new cases in a single day, a new record. Don’t fixate on the precise numbers. We are testing more than ever so we find more cases. What matters is the big picture and it is drawn in stark relief: the crisis is not yet over. Far from it. Even as east Asia and Europe begin to experience recovery, the momentum of the disease at the global level is building. Nor is this the famous “second wave”. This is still the first wave spreading out across the world’s 7.8 billion inhabitants.
The question is do we have the political imagination, the sympathy and the grit necessary to grasp this crisis at the world level? Can public opinion and decision-makers in Europe and Asia, where the disease has been more or less effectively suppressed, be rallied to support an adequate global response to the crisis in the rest of the world? The pandemic poses a profound challenge to the contemporary imagination. It has made real both the degree of our interconnectedness and the extreme difficulty that we, particularly those of us in the west, have in grasping the global forces that are at work. This was already obvious back in January 2020. No need here to rehash the painful story of delay and prevarication; endless recriminations and postmortems are their own form of parochialism. The point is that the west treated a crisis in Wuhan as a remote and exotic problem, made all the more so by China’s “totalitarian” response. We talked about a “Chernobyl moment” for Xi’s regime, as though this was a crisis happening in the 1980s in an obscure Ukrainian town behind the iron curtain, rather than a highly infectious disease spreading through one of the world’s most dynamic and well-connected conurbations. The model should have been Chicago not Chernobyl. London and New York, which bask in their status as “world cities”, did not appear to appreciate that a crisis in Wuhan was a matter of the utmost importance. In the US the most critical failures in February and March were not so much in Washington DC but in New York. California locked down. New York did not. We know the results. In New York state at least 31,484 people have died, as of yesterday. So much for the failures. But even our appreciation of the geography of success is biased. The countries that did get it right were those closest to China, which have had recent experience of infectious disease threats such as Mers. But, again, we tend to exoticise their difference. We pigeonhole them as striving, emerging-market “Asian tigers”, countries with inhuman school regimes, dizzying student scores in Stem subjects, and a relaxed approach to personal privacy. It is time to look again at the numbers and face the facts. South Korea and Taiwan are no longer “emerging”. They have emerged. Indeed, they have overtaken much of the west in terms of affluence, technological sophistication and the basic public security they offer their fortunate citizens. Singapore, invoked by Brexiteers as though it were a bargain-basement model of a free-market society, is, in fact, in the super league of affluence, alongside Switzerland and oil-rich Norway. Taiwan’s GDP per capita is on a par with that of the richer European countries – think Germany and Sweden. South Korea is in the range of Spain, the UK and New Zealand. Covid-19 is a wake-up call to adjust our world rankings and our understanding of our place in them. As the rest of the world has floundered, the problem for the success stories, including China, has been to contain the risk of reinfection from the outside. There was a sense of historical justice in this. Beginning in the 19th century, European states built a global public health regime with the explicit objective of limiting the spread of diseases such as cholera and yellow fever from Asia and Africa to the west. In 2020 Asia feared infection from Europe. But this carnivalesque inversion of historic geographies was short-lived. Now, as the disease spreads to Latin America, Africa and south Asia, a grim new hierarchy threatens. The disease will divide those that are rich, and thus in a position to “cope”, from the rest. Covid-19 may become another of those “poor-country diseases” that kills hundreds of thousands in a regular year. Think malaria or TB, but more infectious and thus requiring more rigorous social distancing. The implications for our multiethnic, mobile societies are grim. Mexican Americans make up roughly 11% of the US population, Latinos all told 18%. Millions pass back and forth every year. Latin America now accounts for 53% of global mortality. You might think that the rampant spread of Covid-19 south of the US border would be an urgent priority for the US. Trump will of course exploit the disaster for his xenophobic purposes. But what is the progressive answer?
The only reason that the Americas do not entirely dominate the global mortality statistics right now is that the numbers are rising ominously in India and Africa, too. If it continues on its current track, this escalation will pose huge challenges for migrant workers and their families, as quarantine rules restrict travel and surging unemployment cuts off remittance flows. The poor-country Covid-19 crisis was long foretold. In the spring there was a flurry of activity among institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank. But this was followed by a sense of anticlimax as the disease seemed to slow. The global pandemic is now in full flood. In March the vast majority of the world locked down. It has not been sustained. It would take catastrophic death rates to make a second lockdown politically viable. If Chinese or European-style suppression is off the table, the focus must be on low-cost mass testing and a global push to ensure best practice in treatment, including key drugs for all. The costs are high but eminently affordable. With the US hamstrung by its isolationist president, the question of Covid-19, as on other global challenges such as climate breakdown, is whether Asia and Europe can combine to deliver the necessary leadership. • Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University",2020-06-30 07:00:06+00:00,102247,2

Mr Hancock said a speedy response was well under way, thanks to what he described as good collaboration with the city’s local authorities. Not for the first time, this turned out to be a blithe ministerial assertion that was soon disproved by events. Over the weekend, confusion reigned over what to do about Leicester’s surge of cases and who was responsible for doing it. The home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested on national television that a stricter lockdown was imminent in the city; Leicester’s mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, said such talk was simply speculation. Sir Peter said there had been no discussions with the government on the subject and that the council had no powers to implement a lockdown. In the early hours of Monday, the mayor received a peremptory government email which, he said, looked like it had been “cobbled together very hastily”. It recommended that present restrictions be extended for two weeks beyond 4 July. Miscommunication was followed by misunderstanding and mutual incomprehension. Far from collaborating effectively with Leicester’s local authorities, the government appears to have failed adequately to either liaise with, inform or empower them. Efficient local lockdowns could be crucial in preventing a second wave of Covid-19, so this desperate muddle has worrying implications. It is also part of a pattern of disregard and highhandedness in Whitehall’s dealings with the regions. From the beginning of this crisis, the government has ignored, bypassed and undervalued the expertise of councils. Private companies have been deployed to carry out testing, the results of which were often delayed. The contact-tracing experience of local authority public health teams has been underutilised, as Serco was awarded a contract to hire teams of tracers from scratch. Earlier this month, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, had described the idea of local lockdowns as a “recipe for chaos”. In a joint statement with the mayor of Liverpool, Mr Burnham lamented the lack of information on how shutdowns would be enforced and pleaded for local directors of public health to be given far more real-time data on local infections. The sense of neglect extends to a financial black hole in town hall finances. Having been promised that the government would do “whatever it takes” to support them through the crisis, it emerged last week that many councils were on the verge of going bankrupt. As ever during this epidemic, comparisons with Germany, where regions have more power and more responsibility, are instructive. Last week, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia swiftly reimposed lockdown in two neighbouring communities, after a surge in cases related to a local meat-packing factory. Stricter physical-distancing rules were enforced, schools closed and the hospitality sector shut down. The state’s response came against the backdrop of an agreed national containment threshold of 50 new infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. Contrast that with this country, as it prepares to reopen pubs, restaurants and hotels on Saturday. At this crucial stage, there should not be a lack of clarity over what happens if things go wrong. If post-lockdown England is to navigate its way through the next period, Boris Johnson and his senior ministers must shake off their centralising instincts and finally learn to trust local knowledge and experience. There must be no more Leicester-style fiascos.",2020-06-29 18:44:23+00:00,102344,2
102436,commentisfree/2020/jun/29/tories-party-of-risk-covid-19-boris-johnson-public-safety,Opinion,The Tories once said only they could keep us safe. Now they're the party of risk | Andy Beckett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/tories-party-of-risk-covid-19-boris-johnson-public-safety,"So much has changed in Britain since the Tories took power 10 years ago. Less noticed is that the Conservative party itself has changed: from one that prioritises keeping the public safe to one happy to put us at risk. From their cuts in police numbers to their cosy relations with Russian donors, from their apparent readiness to let Brexit threaten food and medical supplies to their lack of urgency about the climate crisis, the Conservatives have seemed increasingly cavalier about social stability, public health and national security for years. Now their approach to Covid-19 has confirmed that impression to a frightening degree. Announcing the government’s latest relaxation of its belatedly imposed, optimistically short lockdown last week, Boris Johnson advised the public to “use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks”. In other words, staying safe during the pandemic is essentially up to you. Yet only five years ago, the Conservatives declared in their general election manifesto: “The first duty of government is to keep you safe.” It was the latest in decades of grand promises that declared only the Tories would properly protect Britain’s borders, stand up to hostile countries, and maintain law and order. Even disruptive Tory governments, such as Margaret Thatcher’s, presented themselves as antidotes to a greater disorder. She won power in 1979 with a manifesto that pledged to protect “family life” and “the rule of law”, in a society supposedly “on the brink of disintegration” after Labour rule. At more recent elections, the Tories have warned repeatedly that even Labour participation in a coalition government would bring “chaos”.
This previous Tory preoccupation with public safety did exclude a lot of people, it is true. For many immigrants, poor people and other victims of their economic experiments, the Conservatives provided less security, not more. But the party often managed to convince an electorally decisive number of voters that it would give them a quiet life. As the revered Tory philosopher Michael Oakeshott put it in a 1956 essay On Being Conservative: “The man of conservative temperament … is not in love with what is dangerous.” Were he still alive, Oakeshott’s reaction to a Tory government dominated by Dominic Cummings would be interesting. On the wilder fringes of global conservatism, some rightwingers have always been attracted to the concept of a “nightwatchman state”: a government that does little except protect property and keep law and order. It may be an alarming idea if you’ve ever benefited from a welfare state. But even a nightwatchman state probably wouldn’t have let people with Covid-19 fly into Britain, as Johnson did throughout spring. The government’s recklessness reflects his character: throughout his life, the consequences of his actions for other people have rarely been a big concern. It also reflects the worldview of the Conservative membership, who voted overwhelmingly for Johnson to become their leader and prime minister last July, despite his disastrous record as foreign secretary and erratic one as mayor of London. The previous month, pollsters YouGov found that almost two-thirds of Tory members – nearly the same proportion that chose Johnson – were prepared to see Scotland and Northern Ireland leave the UK, and see “significant damage” done to the economy, in order to achieve Brexit. Since Thatcher’s election, a succession of governments have increasingly concentrated Britain’s wealth among the retired and in the Conservative heartland of the home counties. Many Tory members, like many other Brexit voters, are comfortably off pensioners. They can perhaps afford to take more risks – personally, and with the country’s future – than the rest of us. Some of the disregard for public safety may also be a US import. Johnson, Cummings and their key minister, Michael Gove, are all keen students of the US, where conservatives have long attacked government attempts to make everyday life more secure as infantilising the public and a distortion of the natural social and economic order. Through their disdain for Covid-19 lockdowns, Donald Trump and many Republican-run states are currently testing this conservative argument – possibly to destruction – in an election year. In Britain, any electoral reckoning over the government’s addiction to risk is probably much further off. While ratings for its overall handling of the pandemic have deteriorated badly since the spring, a majority of voters initially support the major loosening of lockdown planned for 4 July. After a long national confinement, a prime minister who says, “People need to go out and enjoy themselves”, as Johnson did last week, is in quite an appealing and politically strong position – at least until the downsides of that enjoyment become obvious. It’s tricky to oppose such liberation without sounding like a killjoy. This probably explains why Keir Starmer’s first reaction was to “welcome” the lockdown easing, despite its dangers. This could be a stance he comes to regret.
Yet it’s striking that, on other occasions, the new Labour leader and his shadow ministers have frequently spoken up about public safety: not just in relation to Covid-19, but also with regard to crime and terrorism. Making Britain safer has been one of few identifiable themes, so far, of Starmer’s rather terse leadership. Since he’s a former director of public prosecutions, that’s perhaps to be expected. But the language he’s chosen has felt significant. “The number one priority must be to keep people safe,” he wrote in the Wolverhampton Express & Star earlier this month, seeking to raise his profile in a city where all the constituencies are Tory or Labour marginals. His words were a repeat, more approachably expressed, of the promise in the 2015 Tory manifesto: “The first duty of government is to keep you safe.” He’s trying to win over worried Tories. During the 21st century, to a startling degree, the Conservatives have become ever more reliant on older voters: since the 2001 election, their lead over Labour among the over-65s has grown from one to 47 percentage points. Given the awful toll on elderly people from Covid-19, it’s conceivable that, at some point quite soon, this part of the electorate will begin switching from the Tories to Labour – as they did when Labour was led by another former lawyer who promised to make Britain safe again: Tony Blair. When the Tories eventually lose power, some future leader, more sober than Johnson, may wonder how their party came to be so keen on reopening pubs during a pandemic. Keeping the public safe is hard work for any government, and is often unrewarded – the absence of danger isn’t noticed. But not keeping the public safe may not be forgiven for decades. The Conservatives are about to start finding out if that’s the case. • Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",2020-06-29 11:37:22+00:00,102437,2
102518,commentisfree/2020/jun/29/the-next-big-test-for-australians-during-the-pandemic-getting-used-to-being-inconvenienced,Opinion,The next big test for Australians during the pandemic? Getting used to being inconvenienced | Johanna Leggatt,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/the-next-big-test-for-australians-during-the-pandemic-getting-used-to-being-inconvenienced,"Australia’s pandemic story – the tale we tell ourselves to get through Covid-19 – has changed. We had all but beaten the virus by shutting down the economy and paying the price in considerable job losses. While those long weeks of lockdown felt desperate and interminable – what with the indecorous brawling over toilet paper and the home isolation – we were starting to see an endpoint, the stirrings of a future that was not shadowed by Covid-19. Next up, surely, would be trips to New Zealand, hugging friends, and finally the vaccine breakthrough that would restore the world as it was.
Medical experts warned us about a second wave, pointing to examples of small peaks in other countries with similar case levels, but as we gradually reopened our doors to our businesses and our homes, we hewed to this story of good fortune. It could have been so much worse. We were so lucky. We are lucky, of course, to be weathering the pandemic in a country with Australia’s well-equipped healthcare system, and we are, by all accounts, still tracking remarkably well in terms of mounting global deaths and cases. Yet, the sobering reality of daily life in a pandemic – the seesawing between freedom and restriction, connection and isolation – is increasingly clear. Melburnians have felt this intensely over the past week, as a rise in cases of community transmission prompted premier Daniel Andrews to reimpose restrictions on family and outdoor gatherings, and announce a widespread testing blitz in hotspot suburbs assisted by Australian defence force personnel. Panic buying returned to some Melbourne stores, forcing CEOs of both major supermarkets to write yet another group email explaining to customers that they will have to – yet again – limit the purchase of essentials to stop grown adults from stockpiling. Victoria is the proverbial canary in the coalmine at the moment, and as the past week has shown, it only takes a small amount of community transmission for the government to hit pause on our lives, just when we were starting to enjoy a degree of freedom again. It is clear now that the new normal, the one we are all desperate to define, is resistant to categorisation. What we can say for certain is that we will be inconvenienced in a number of ways for an indeterminate amount of time in many parts of our life. There is speculation that large employers will require employees to queue for temperature checks and lifts if and when they return to the office. Retailers are asking people to wait in line to enter stores when maximum capacity is reached. People in Melbourne’s CBD now queue to enter the tiny holes in the wall where the city’s best coffee emerges from. Eating out has become a well-choreographed event, arranged into 90-minute sessions and requiring contact details on arrival. Gyms, too, quite reasonably, require strict adherence to group fitness etiquette and hand sanitisation. This is likely to be OK for a little while, but frustration will set in as the economy continues to contract and life fails to return to normal. How will Australians handle the feeling of being monumentally inconvenienced at a time when the colour has been bleached from our lives, and big plans no longer shimmer on the horizon? After all, we cannot gather in groups with friends and family to find comfort in the unifying experience of shared inconvenience, or vent about the ignominy of being stuck in a hot-spot. I have enormous faith in Australians when an expansive effort is needed against all odds, but I wonder how exemplary our conduct will be when our lifestyle, practically a modern obsession, is what is at stake.
If incidents of road rage are any indication, we are not especially patient either. Anyone who has accidentally cut someone off on an Australian road and watched the offended driver’s rage unfold in operatic disgust in the rear-view mirror, would be well aware of our intolerance for altered schedules or minor delays. Perhaps Australians are allergic to inconvenience because we are used to so many comforts, of things being a certain way. We can make sacrifices if the reward is in sight, but with this pandemic there is no moment to arrive at, no clearly marked point in the future in which we formally rejoice the end. We may have a vaccine in a couple of years, but we may not. We may be able to travel interstate to see our elderly parents later this year, or we may not. We are making sacrifices to prevent something from happening rather than the much more satisfying experience of pitching in together to bring about something new. It’s an important demand, a necessary test, but a tough one nevertheless. • Johanna Leggatt is a Melbourne-based journalist",2020-06-29 03:03:54+00:00,102519,2
102597,commentisfree/2020/jun/28/coronavirus-long-haulers-infectious-disease-testing,Opinion,The coronavirus 'long-haulers' show how little we still know | Debbie Bogaert,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/28/coronavirus-long-haulers-infectious-disease-testing,"To a physician scientist working on understanding the burden of respiratory infections, coronavirus is the ultimate professional challenge that might come by perhaps once in your career. However, I was not prepared for it becoming one of my biggest personal challenges too. During the early stages of the outbreak, I came down with mild Covid-19-like symptoms. Though I was slightly worried this would hinder my ability to contribute to the immediate professional battle against this virus, I also anticipated I would be back in business within a week or two. How wrong I was – I became what we now call a Covid-19 “long-hauler” – a patient with initially mild symptoms of likely Covid-19, who would go on to experience a range of sometimes severe symptoms for a prolonged period of time. The Covid Symptom Study, undertaken by King’s College London, has revealed that 10% of all Covid-19 patients report symptoms for at least three weeks. Surprisingly, people in this so-called Covid tail are on average younger. Most report having been previously healthy, and show relatively mild symptoms in the initial phase of illness. But they continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, headache, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, increased heart rates and gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms for weeks or even months following the initial symptoms; often these symptoms might come and go repeatedly.
Though physically I still struggle with lung problems, as a doctor and a scientist I struggle mostly with the lack of knowledge about this condition. We currently have no understanding at all of the biological mechanisms causing these prolonged symptoms. Theoretically, they may be the result of ongoing or resurgent viral replication – which would be important to know since this would imply prolonged infectiousness as well. Perhaps, however, as observed in more severe cases of coronavirus, the virus may trigger an aberrant immune response, resulting in ongoing inflammation throughout the body, which may last far beyond clearance of the virus. A third alternative, as observed commonly following bacterial pneumonia, is that the coronavirus causes more extensive damage of lungs, heart and other organ systems than suggested by the initial symptoms, which simply requires more time to recover. Without this knowledge, we don’t know if long-haulers are infectious for prolonged periods, or whether they are at risk of experiencing severe complications, and certainly not whether treatment might reduce the duration of their problems. Left unattended, these patients may even develop irreversible damage leading to chronic illnesses. Until we develop this medical and scientific knowledge, healthcare professionals won’t have the guidance needed to treat these long-haulers. Establishing specialty clinics to gather data from long-haulers in a systematic and concerted manner – comparable to what currently exists for severely ill adults following hospital discharge – would allow rapid development of guidelines for diagnostics, treatment and follow-up, with the focus on stimulating recovery and preventing development of chronic problems. However, this would be another big ask on already strained health services. In dire need of recognition and support, a high number of long-haulers have organised themselves in online peer support groups. Depending on the country of origin, many report not having received any medical support during their illness, or being dismissed repeatedly. Others report being brushed off by healthcare professionals, misdiagnosed and in receipt of conflicting advice. They also experienced a wide range of stigma – friends keeping their distance for fear they might be infectious, sympathy draining because they “should” have recovered by now, and employers losing patience with the number of days taken off work. To support research and inform healthcare professionals, one Covid-19 support group in the US has already made a start in collecting and distributing health-related information from their members in a systematic way. The emergence of this new group of long-haulers confirms once again the importance of testing all potential cases in the community, even mild ones, to confirm the presence of Covid-19. Given we do not know yet who will develop long-term complications, a confirmed diagnosis could help physicians to separate patients with likely Covid-19-induced long-term health problems from patients with other inflammation-driven illnesses, which, if misclassified, might lead to delays in treatment and long-term consequences. In the last six months, Covid-19 has shown many faces, first causing a high burden of acutely and severely ill patients requiring extensive and intensive care; second being linked with a rare but potentially severe syndrome in children resembling Kawasaki disease; and third a much more common protracted illness among initially mildly infected, and generally young and healthy, adults. This virus is not comparable to a simple flu. Therefore we should focus on suppressing the virus as much as possible, even attempting to eliminate it, while we wait for the development of a vaccine. • Debby Bogaert is a professor in paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh",2020-06-28 13:00:05+00:00,102598,107

I knew that being a doctor was going to be a challenge mentally and emotionally, but nothing could have prepared me for working as a respiratory junior doctor, looking after those with suspected or confirmed coronavirus. I have learned first-hand how quickly a patient can become critically unwell from the virus. Our patients can quite often end up being taken to the intensive care unit, leaving me unsure whether I will ever see them again. We also look after those who are too frail to go to intensive care, for whom ventilation would be of little benefit and would increase their suffering. The outcomes for these patients can be poor. In the process of becoming a doctor, you learn to manage and cure disease – but failing that, to do your utmost to give the person in front of you a good death. I have always found a great deal of solace in a patient dying a natural, timely death, without discomfort and surrounded by their loved ones. Covid-19 has stolen that. We do what we can, though it often feels like it is not enough. I remember the faces of the patients I have been beside during their last minutes. I still struggle to find the right words and am aware that mine is the last face they will see: a near stranger covered up by a mask. After I confirm the death, I gather myself and phone the person’s next of kin. We try to let the family know that their loved one is dying, but occasionally it happens unexpectedly. We’re taught at medical school how to have difficult conversations with patients and relatives – always in person. Now many of these conversations are happening over the phone, sometimes with poor reception, or when the person on the other end is hard of hearing. It feels so impersonal. For them, I am just a voice at the end of a phone changing their reality for ever, and I can’t even offer them a cup of tea or a tissue. Nor have they seen in many cases just how unwell their loved one has become, so it demands a great deal of trust on their part in the judgment of the medical team. One reason I chose to go into medicine was to be useful when others are at their most vulnerable, but at times I feel useless in the face of some of these most basic needs of my patients. A small proportion of the patients we see have caught the virus either from hospital or another care setting, and there is a great deal of guilt that comes with that. In healthcare we make the promise to first do no harm, but being a patient in hospital now comes with a level of risk never before experienced. This is despite stringent infection control measures, such as PPE and handwashing. I see patients only when necessary, in order to reduce their exposure, whereas previously I would stay and chat, particularly with those without many visitors. Only now that’s all of them, and it’s too risky to simply go into their room to brighten up their day. It is almost impossible not to take an element of the darkness home. I will do anything to keep busy to avoid thinking about the suffering I have witnessed and been unable to prevent. I feel exhausted, but so do many of my colleagues. We talk about “Covid fatigue”, which has come partially from not being able to see an end to the type of medicine we’re now practising: the pandemic has increased our workload while taking away much of what makes the job rewarding. With lockdown measures easing we are going to have more patients coming into hospital with Covid again, as well as having more patients attending with other issues who may contract the virus. We managed the first wave by putting all but the most urgent services on hold, but things will have to resume, only now with longer waiting times than ever for patients. It will be a long time before our hospitals will be operating normally again. How things are now will be impossible to sustain longer term, but in the NHS, as always, we will find a way, for the sake of everyone. • Gisele Spencer is a junior NHS doctor",2020-06-27 11:00:00+00:00,102781,107

Britain is a tinderbox of inequality and, after weeks of Black Lives Matter protests, there’s simmering anger at the police. The inability of Mr Johnson to get children in England back to school this term, and the news of thousands of employees being let go from what were regarded as secure jobs, have added to a wider sense of discontent. The coercive nature of the lockdown had been eroded by the lingering anger over the Dominic Cummings affair. The heatwave then made enforcement of restrictions almost impossible. Instead of thinking about its role and the state of the UK, Downing Street has decided in England to shirk its responsibilities and shift the burden to local government. Councils are going bust as the government outsources more the responsibility for the fallout from the pandemic without adequately resourcing them. This is dangerous, and could feed into a situation over the summer months where confrontations with the police, tasked to quash local virus outbreaks, swell to such a scale that social cohesion is threatened. There’s a lack of effort to ensure that the public’s best interests are upheld in the prime minister’s messaging. The use of political rhetoric has consequences. The public did not wait for the lockdown to be lifted on 4 July, a date that looks like it was picked so newspapers could describe it as “independence day”. Instead of abiding by the current rules, people gathered in large numbers with no apparent concern for the pandemic. They may have got the impression that they could do so because Mr Johnson said he couldn’t wait to go the pub or for England to get its bustle back. People are perhaps unwilling to take steps to avoid disaster because the messaging from Mr Johnson emphasises the reopening rather than the risks. There’s a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy. The government understandably wants the country to get back to normal, but has not used the time afforded by the lockdown to chart a route out of the crisis. With no vaccine or treatment against the virus, countries can only track its spread with comprehensive testing, isolate those infected or potentially infected, and convince everyone else to take precautionary steps such as washing hands regularly and wearing face masks in crowded places. It is inexplicable, therefore, as to why the government decided to ease restrictions while daily infections are still running into four figures, there is a projected death toll of 20,000 more people by next April and a largely privatised “test, trace, isolate” system has yet to prove its effectiveness. Across the Atlantic is a cautionary tale. Confronted by the pandemic, Donald Trump’s response was to minimise it, downplaying the realities of the lockdown while bragging about what an “amazing” job he’s doing and spreading conspiracy theories. Today, almost all the surges in coronavirus cases are in Trump-voting parts of the country, which were the quickest to ease restrictions and are now having to reimpose them. The more populist a leader the less they trust their public. Mr Johnson revels in the unprincipled tyranny of his parliamentary majority. He seeks to avoid any decision for which he would have to take political responsibility and wants unequivocal answers from advisers that will protect him from criticism. But this will not foster the deeper engagement and buy-in from the public that is essential to break the pandemic’s grip on the UK. • This article was amended on 20 June 2020. An earlier version referred to a projected death toll of 20,000 by next April. The projection is for 20,000 more people by April, not 20,000 in total as an earlier version implied.",2020-06-26 17:30:12+00:00,102879,2

Lockdown restrictions are being relaxed across the UK, with England easing the quickest. From 4 July, hotels in Cornwall will be open and so will London pubs. If things go according to plan, the cash that some households have been accumulating for the past three months will be unleashed in a wave of spending that will rescue bars, shops and restaurants from looming bankruptcy. The furlough scheme, introduced by chancellor Rishi Sunak at the start of the crisis will no longer be necessary. The UK will have a tough 2020 but disaster will be averted. Yet nothing about the government’s handling of the pandemic so far inspires confidence that things will go according to plan. There were inadequate stocks of protective equipment. There was not enough spare capacity in the NHS. Decanting elderly patients from hospitals turned care homes into death traps. The lockdown was delayed, with baleful consequences for both health and the economy. Where is the promised world-beating tracking and testing scheme?
So it’s a reasonable bet that something will go wrong now as well. One risk is that there will be a second outbreak at some point over the coming months, because that is what has happened in Germany, where the crisis management has been much better than in Britain. All things considered, this is a risk worth taking because it isn’t feasible to keep the country in a near-frozen state indefinitely. The economy is on course for its biggest one-year contraction in 300 years, with the poor and the young the worst affected groups financially. The deaths of those who may contract Covid-19 have to be balanced against the deaths of cancer patients deprived of treatment, the rising number of suicides and cases of child abuse, domestic violence and mental illness caused by ordering people to stay at home. As the number of Covid-19 cases comes down, it is right that these other considerations are given extra weight. The other big risk – so far much less debated – is of a massive rise in unemployment if the government botches the next phase of the economy’s recovery. Here, the assumption is that Sunak – one of the few members of the cabinet to have emerged from the crisis with his reputation enhanced – is fully on top of things and will make all the right calls. The chancellor’s record is not perfect, though. Even after expanding the coverage of his income support to include the self-employed, there are still more than a million people uncovered. Sunak had to provide a 100% state guarantee for small businesses after it emerged that financial help was not arriving from the banks quickly enough. The temporary increases in universal credit were welcome but only reverse a fraction of the cuts in welfare announced by a former chancellor, George Osborne, five years ago. None of this poses a serious threat to Sunak’s reputation as a safe pair of hands, but it will be a different story if unemployment rockets this autumn as a result of the government’s furlough scheme being removed too abruptly from the most vulnerable sectors of the economy. Wage subsidies will start to be phased out in August and will be gone completely by the end of October. The chancellor is at heart an economic liberal. He had no choice but to adopt an interventionist approach when the decision was made to lock down the economy, but that doesn’t mean he finds the current situation comfortable. He thinks the best solution to the difficulties faced by hospitality businesses or retailers is to give consumers the freedom to spend rather than any additional government support. This approach is fraught with massive risks. The hospitality, retailing and leisure sectors employ millions of workers, and business was not exactly booming before the crisis. Many of them have had no takings for the past three months, and some restrictions will remain in place when the lockdown is lifted. Workers who have been on the furlough scheme will have seen their spending power reduced because they are on only 80% of their wages. They will be wary of spending too freely in case they are laid off over the coming months. It’s a mistake to imagine that 2020 is going to be a re-run of the UK’s last recession in 2008-9, when the economy shrank by more than 6% but employment fell by less than 3 percentage points. As the labour market expert Prof Paul Gregg has pointed out, Britain could well be on course for a repeat of the early 1990s, when a much smaller fall in activity of 3% coincided with a 4.5 percentage point fall in employment. The contraction in the economy this year will be much more severe than in either the early 1990s or the late noughties. The International Monetary Fund is at the optimistic end of the spectrum but is still predicting a 10% decline. Job losses are likely to be concentrated in sectors that are labour intensive, so the chances are that employment will fall by 10 percentage points as well, and perhaps by more. If that’s the case, the Bank of England’s forecast that unemployment will rise from 4% to 9% will prove far too low. The jobless rate will hit 14%-15%, the dole queues will lengthen to more than 4 million.
Gregg’s conclusion is stark. “The central point here is that the government has ploughed huge amounts of money into preserving firms and especially jobs. A large part of this will be wasted if the job retention scheme ends abruptly after lockdown ends. Furthermore, the fallout will be massive and the recession risks being more severe and sustained if there is a collapse of demand in the economy from widespread job loss and, even more important, widespread fear of job loss kicks in.” That all sounds frighteningly prescient. Having sleep-walked into a health crisis, the government is about to sleepwalk into an unemployment crisis. Britain’s employment rate stood at a record level going into the pandemic, primarily because there were more women, ethnic minorities, older people, lone parents and immigrants in work. These are the low-paid, low-productivity jobs that are most at threat from the coming storm. Historians may come to view the great financial crisis of 2008-9 and the great lockdown crisis of 2020-21 as a single event. There was no fundamental change to the failed model that led to the banks nearly going bust in 2008, merely a set of sticking plaster solutions, including the creation of millions of insecure jobs. In the long term, an economic rethink and reboot is needed. In the short run, the response has to be to protect as many jobs as possible. There are plenty of options: targeting the furlough at vulnerable sectors; allowing all companies to furlough part-time staff for longer; cutting employers’ national insurance contributions. Otherwise, the current euphoria will quickly fade in the grimmest of winters. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor",2020-06-25 13:52:42+00:00,103173,2
103190,commentisfree/2020/jun/25/dystopia-or-utopia-the-future-of-cities-could-go-either-way,Opinion,Dystopia or utopia? The future of cities could go either way | Chris Michael,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/dystopia-or-utopia-the-future-of-cities-could-go-either-way,"A friend of mine who is a doctor in Ontario, one of the Canadian provinces most affected by coronavirus, told me a fascinating story about what Covid-19 has meant for his work. He had long been an advocate for treating patients remotely, arguing that a single group video session on, say, diabetes, could replace dozens of one-on-one consultations; and nurse practitioners could be empowered to handle routine medical interventions. Paradoxically, he said, this would actually mean more personal attention for patients, as doctors would be freed for the most urgent cases. His colleagues figured he was a dangerous maverick. Then coronavirus struck, the entire medical profession adopted his ideas en masse, and my friend’s clinic is now considered cutting-edge. “The virus forced a real-life experiment that achieved in a month what I’d struggled to argue for 10 years,” he said. If, as appears likely, we don’t get a vaccine that fixes Covid-19 at a stroke, we’ll likely be living with this virus in some time, as we do with influenza. So what does that mean for city life, so truncated these past few months? Is the Covid-19 pandemic a death blow to our cities, a stake driven through the heart of our ideal of dense, communal urban living? Or, like my friend’s experience suggests, is the pandemic an opening, an invitation to do things differently, in all facets of urban life? Dystopia: hold on to your hat The dystopian theory, as usual, is the grim one, where many people simply flee. Those who can will either work remotely from a second home, or sell up and move to the suburbs or beyond. Those who cannot – people barely making ends meet on state benefits, or working service jobs that require them to be in place – will be forced to stay. Many will be people of colour, whose vulnerability to the virus is already reflected in data showing that black people are dying at roughly twice the rate of white people. As with the post-war “white flight” to the suburbs, the city centres will be abandoned by those with money, leaving them to crumble and reversing several decades of urban renewal. The old Victorian prejudice that urban density is a hive of disease and immorality will reign once again. Certainly, the fear of pestilence is already causing us to shun subways, thereby hurting a crucial mechanism that allows cities to thrive. Transit ridership, already on the slow decline in the US, will plummet – not just out of fear, but because social distancing requirements mean metros can only handle about 15% of their previous riderships. Thinkers such as Joel Kotkin have argued that car-oriented sprawl is not just a natural outcome of the pandemic, but an ideal model of safe and independent living. We’ll all drive everywhere, terrified, alone, worsening congestion and poisoning the air as we go. Air pollution is already nearly back to pre-Covid levels, and this is while most major cities remain in some form of lockdown. When it lifted in Wuhan, private car use nearly doubled. With commuting even more miserable than before, more companies will follow Twitter in allowing their employees to work from home for ever. We’ll all get lonelier and more depressed as a result, with lower productivity and fewer of the “weak ties” that social scientists say make cities productive. Home workers will shoulder the costs of home offices. Soon enough, commercial real estate will tank. New York has 550m sq metres of office space; even a 10% drop would set off a shockwave. House prices could crash, too: they’re already down in May in the UK by 0.2%, and we’re just getting started. Who knows what could set off a full-blown panic that pops the urban real estate bubble, and plunges us straight into the Great Corona Depression? In any event, many urban industries will never recover. It’s a given that restaurants, which already have notoriously thin profit margins, will outright collapse in record numbers. (My father, who runs a restaurant in Toronto, has already decided he’s not even going to bother to try reopening, and is selling the building.) J Crew, Nieman Marcus, JC Penney and Hertz are just the start, the American businesses that went bankrupt even while the US government was still drenching them with the money hose. When the faucet squeaks off, our streets will become dried out husks of boarded-up storefronts. City governments, without the property tax base, will go bankrupt. Already, according to a National League of Cities analysis in May, the overall budget shortfall for US cities, towns and villages is expected to top $360bn by 2022. If this destitution leads to less funding for social services and therefore a rise in crime, we might see more aggressive policing in black and brown communities, of the kind that has led to the recent protests. Utopia: maybe it won’t be so bad The utopians, however, look at the same apocalypse and see a lot fewer zombies. Cities, they say, badly needed a change of course. Now that we’ve discovered with our own lungs the benefits of less air pollution – Los Angeles has enjoyed its longest streak of “good” air quality days since 1995 – we’ll demand better emissions standards, congestion pricing and more car-free streets. Everyone who can will buy a bike – in fact they already are – as cities from Paris to Bogotá free up car lanes for cycleways. Health, both physical and mental, will improve. Overburdened transit systems will, blissfully, be less like sardine cans. The inevitable decline in transit fares will force governments to properly fund mass transit as a public service, which they should have done from the beginning; the cities that don’t do so will immediately lose ground to those that do. Ultra-low emission zones like London’s will grow stronger until the only cars that remain are electric; we’ll all be able to join Copenhagen’s pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2025, thereby at least partly mitigating the true danger from which Covid-19 has distracted us: the climate emergency.
Remote working will be with us for good, yes, but in the early-internet ideal of the glorious erasure of distance. For staff, it will mean eased childcare concerns and a higher quality of life. Many companies, for their part, will save cash on office space, freeing up money to invest in productivity. Any subsequent downtick in commercial real estate values will be offset because those firms that do still need some office space will likely need more of it: social distancing (at the Guardian’s office in London it’s 2 metres between workstations) requires more floorspace, not less. Co-working spaces for remote workers who lack home offices will proliferate, too. (I’m not sure the return of WeWork qualifies as utopian, but on we go.) Density, far from being the bugbear of cities, will remain their great appeal. As soon as we’ve grown accustomed to wearing masks, as the Japanese do (and maybe even started bowing instead of shaking hands), we’ll find that cities remain the safest places to live: better access to hospitals and community services mean if you do contract Covid-19 you’re in the best hands. The world’s densest cities – Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore – have handled the virus spectacularly well. Even the fear of transit may abate, as we learn from the cases of Japan or France where it hasn’t generally spread the virus at all. Restaurants will suffer, yes, but faced with the prospect of having no tenants at all, landlords will negotiate on lower rents – further loosening the vice grip of rentier capitalism that Thomas Piketty argues has led to vast inequality. More independent businesses may be able to afford storefront space. Cities like New York (which, if it weren’t for Central Park, would have one of the worst green-space ratios of any metropolis on Earth) will at last invest in parks, pedestrians and public spaces. Indeed, westerners will be forced to embrace the streets again in a way we haven’t for a generation: hanging out in front yards and parks, on stoops and street corners. And if some people, mostly older because of their higher vulnerability to Covid-19, move to the countryside – well what of it? A modest correction to the housing market, which unfairly enriched the boomer generation at the expense of millennials, will finally defang the great cobra of the urban 21st century: gentrification, at last, will have met its match. Will anyone bemoan less social cleansing, or cry for the overseas investors no longer parking their money in wildly overpriced Thameside or Hudson River developments that have helped make homes unaffordable for actual Londoners and New Yorkers? Who’s right? We don’t know. Some data suggest cities are still attractive, such as a study by City Observatory researcher Joe Cortright that property searches for cities went up in April year on year; others show increases in searches for smaller towns and country properties. Air pollution has returned; but the new cycle lanes remain. The truth is that with governments still terrified to stop spending money, we’re still in phase one. What does seem likely is that the pandemic will prove to be a much-needed corrective to cities that, though thriving in one sense, were becoming almost unlivable for anyone who didn’t earn in the top 10% income bracket. It might help redress the political grievances that have, broadly speaking, pitted liberal urban centres against conservative rural areas in the kind of brutal culture-war cagematches that have given rise to Brexit and Trump. Slightly less gentrification and slightly cleaner air might be worth a bit of economic harm, though as ever, the challenge will be ensuring the poor don’t take the hit. All we know for certain is that cities have been thrown into an experiment we would never otherwise have tried. Given the way things were going, that can’t be entirely a bad thing. Whether you see the results as dystopian or utopian will probably depend a lot on you.",2020-06-25 12:27:38+00:00,103191,2
103206,commentisfree/2020/jun/25/viral-immunologist-antibody-tests-covid-19-immuity-coronavirus,Opinion,I'm a viral immunologist.  Here's what antibody tests for Covid-19 tell us,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/viral-immunologist-antibody-tests-covid-19-immuity-coronavirus,"The sheer speed with which Covid-19 spread across the world, coupled with the novel nature of the virus, has meant that scientists and technicians have been playing a game of catch-up. But our knowledge, though incomplete, is now much greater than it was at the start of the outbreak, and medical systems are better equipped to respond. Part of this means we’ve got better at testing for the disease – attempting to meet the demands of people who want to know if they are, or have been, infected. Dr Alex Richter leads the clinical immunology labs at the University of Birmingham, where I work, and her team has developed serology tests that detect antibodies to Sars-CoV-2. For the time being, laboratory tests such as theirs are more sensitive than commercial antibody kits. But an increasing number of the latter are becoming available around the world, many of them over the counter.
As we go further down this road, it’s important that people understand what antibodies reveal about our immune response to Covid-19, and how protective immunity works. Basically, antibodies to Sars-CoV-2 show that you have been infected, although people with other recent coronavirus infections (which includes some common colds) may have cross-reactive antibodies, giving false positives. Serology tests vary in accuracy, but are more effective than so-called polymerise chain reaction (PCR) tests, which detect the presence of the virus itself. One reason is that they rely less on the skill of the person doing the sampling: antibodies in the blood are easier to detect than virus particles in nose or throat swabs. Such tests provide useful information about the way an infection has spread through a population. Newly infected people are unlikely to have detectable antibodies during the first few days, but most develop them after one to three weeks. Knowing how many have become infected helps us estimate the percentage of severe cases and deaths more accurately, and this tells us more about just how dangerous the new pathogen might be. It also helps us identify high-risk groups, which can offer clues as to how the virus may be transmitted. Take Richter’s study, in which she tested 516 healthcare workers for Covid-19 antibodies: 34% of housekeeping staff came back positive compared with only 15% of staff working in intensive care. Such insights can be used to shield vulnerable groups with protective interventions. Antibodies also offer hope for future protection – but we have yet to fully characterise what immune protection from Covid-19 might consist of. There are two major types of “memory” immune responses – changes to the body that mean you are able to recall a previous threat in order to mount a rapid protective response on reinfection. The first is driven by B cells, which produce antibodies. Vaccine research aims to generate potent, long-lasting antibodies that can protect us for life, but this is not always achieved. When antibodies wane, booster vaccinations can help. When viruses evolve to escape detection, like the fast-mutating flu, a newly designed vaccine is needed to stop them in their tracks. The second cell type able to remember an infection is the T cell. T cells may be sufficient to control infection in the absence of antibodies, and act by organising immune defences (so-called “helper” T cells) or directly killing infected cells to restrict new virus production (cytotoxic T cells). T cell responses have been detected in most Covid-19 patients, and first-in-human vaccine trials have reported potent T cell activation. It is possible that T cells’ memory of Sars-CoV-2 may last longer than antibodies, as is the case in other coronaviruses. Can you develop a T cell response without developing antibodies? That seems to be a possibility: a small study of patients and their families shows that an unexpected six out of eight family members who caught the virus at home had T cell responses but no detectable antibodies. Currently there isn’t an off-the-shelf test to measure our T cell responses, and they do not show up in antibody tests. But then even a positive antibody test, at this stage, doesn’t tell us all that much about protection. The duration of any potentially protective immunity remains to be determined. As with so much related to this pandemic, we will know more as the months pass, and people who have recovered either remain well, or succumb to the virus again. Perhaps of more practical importance right now is a study that followed up 37 asymptomatic people who had positive PCR tests. This showed they had detectable levels of the virus for longer that those who had symptoms. Asymptomatic people are therefore likely to be more contagious. We also know that pre-symptomatic people, those in the early days following infection with Sars-CoV-2, are also highly contagious. Because we are often not aware that we are infected, measures to ensure social distancing and face covering are crucial when it comes to protecting others.
There is some good news on the horizon, though. The first data emerging from vaccine studies show that animals can be protected from Sars-CoV-2 infection, and people do develop hallmarks of protective immunity. This hints that immunological memory is possible. The only way to know for sure, though, is to measure what happens when vaccination volunteers become infected. Ironically, this will take longer in countries that have successfully controlled the virus and have few ongoing infections. As a viral immunologist, I see immunity in Covid-19 as a puzzle that we have yet to solve. But every week, new publications add new pieces to the jigsaw. When vaccines become widely available, protection will be much easier to assess using serology and lab-based tests. Right now, antibody tests do not confirm protection – it is just too early to know the quantity and type that would be necessary for that. They are still important, however, in charting the virus’s progress through our care homes, hospitals, public transport systems and workplaces (even if they do underestimate those affected). It is therefore vital that people who have agreed to be tested and come back positive are not disadvantaged in any way compared to those whose status is unknown. Without this kind of infection surveillance, much of the hardship of lockdown will have been in vain. • Dr Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham",2020-06-25 11:18:44+00:00,103207,2
103237,commentisfree/2020/jun/25/boris-johnson-britain-pub-dead-government-coronavirus,Opinion,"Boris Johnson wants Britain to go to the pub – and forget about the 65,700 dead | Owen Jones",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/boris-johnson-britain-pub-dead-government-coronavirus,"The Luftwaffe did not chalk up such a gruesome death toll. During the blitz, 43,000 civilians died, an average of 175 each day, a national trauma that is seared in Britain’s collective memory. In the past 100 days, the number of reported excess deaths linked to Covid-19 – which England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, declares “the key metric” – has reached 65,700, a daily mortality rate far deadlier than the Nazi onslaught on British towns and cities between September 1940 and May 1941. Inevitable is a word that can be used to describe the tragic fact that families were always going to “lose loved ones before their time”, as the prime minister put it 11 days before he belatedly ordered a national lockdown. It is not a word that can be used to describe one in every 1,000 members of the British public being killed by the virus in a three-month period, or what was at one point the second-worst death rate on earth. Scandalous? Yes. Criminal? Certainly. But inevitable? No. If Boris Johnson has a trump card, a USP in politics, it is can-do, sunny optimism, an ability to dismiss and marginalise his critics as “doomsters” and “gloomsters”. It is our “patriotic duty” to visit the nation’s reopened pubs in a week and a half, he chirrups; “our long national hibernation” is coming to an end. His media outriders, too, hope that a cacophony of clinking beer glasses and flapping union jacks will drown out the dissenters. “SUMMER’S BACK ON!” bellows the Daily Mail as Britain’s national shutters come up. The Daily Express lauds the Dear Leader: “CHEERS BORIS! HERE’S TO A BRIGHTER BRITAIN.” “Our plan is working,” triumphantly declares the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as another 171 deaths are announced. With grinning declarations of victory, our rulers hope, we will all cheerfully shuffle into socially distanced pubs, sink our first freshly poured pints in over a hundred days, and let tens of thousands of fellow citizens who died needless deaths rest in peace. If Johnson and his allies get away with this national calamity, then the questions hovering over our democracy are troubling and grave. What does a government have to do to suffer adverse political consequences, if not violating its “first duty”, as Johnson once put it, “to protect the public in the most basic way” on an unprecedented scale in modern times? The reasons for this are tragically simple. Britain was an international outlier in its approach to the pandemic, and now stands in the top three (after Brazil and the US) for its death toll. If lockdown had been introduced even a week earlier, declared Prof Neil Ferguson, our pre-eminent epidemiologist, our death toll could have been halved. The delay was undoubtedly an “economy first” approach: how utterly self-destructive on its own terms, then, as allowing a graver pandemic inevitably led to a more protracted lockdown, leaving Britain possibly facing the worst economic hit of any developed nation. Patients were released from hospitals into care homes without being tested for coronavirus, allowing the most vulnerable population in Britain to be seeded with a deadly pandemic. The consequences? Around one in 14 care home residents have died from this illness in around three and a half months: that statistic alone should haunt every government minister. The severity of our three combined national emergencies – public health, economic and social – was entirely self-inflicted by our own government. The British public are neither stupid nor oblivious to the catastrophe: their rating of the government’s handling of the crisis is among the worst on earth. World-beating, indeed. But the scale of the criticisms does not match the scale of the disaster. While some journalists have fearlessly challenged the government’s failures – including at Newsnight and, two words I never imagined I would type, ITV’s Piers Morgan – the Pravda-like qualities of much of the rightwing press has undoubtedly helped insulate Johnson’s administration. There is another failing too. Several broadcast journalists express their fear that their industry has failed the public badly in the pandemic. “The media has badly messed up holding the government to account,” one broadcast journalist tells me, “because the priority has been to amplify ‘stay home and protect the NHS’ rather than scrutinising official failings.” It should have been science journalists challenging the government at the now abandoned daily press conferences – which became shams long ago – rather than political reporters. Politics is too often treated as a soap opera, a Westminster drama of who is up and who is down, and this crisis has been no exception. The focus on the “pre-existing health conditions” of many who have died is another factor, too: many have interpreted this as meaning at “death’s door”, as the sad passing of those on the brink of dying anyway, unaware that millions of their fellow citizens qualify for this description. In the US, for example, it’s estimated that up to half the non-elderly population have pre-existing health conditions. According to a study in April, those dying from coronavirus are losing an average of 13 years of their lives. Coronavirus did not gently push the already flailing into their graves; it ruthlessly killed those who still had long to live. Perhaps the government believes a summer of sunshine and beer will make us all forget: that a nation released from house arrest will embrace relief at a new present over a reckoning with the past. Johnson’s trademark combination of bluster and cheer will certainly aim to nurture this collective amnesia. But we should know this: if a government can get away with the avoidable deaths of tens of thousands of its own citizens, it can get away with anything and everything. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",2020-06-25 08:45:04+00:00,103238,2
103397,commentisfree/2020/jun/24/worlds-poorest-people-coronavirus-vaccine-gavi,Opinion,How will the world's poorest people get a coronavirus vaccine? | Achal Prabhala and Kate Elder,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/24/worlds-poorest-people-coronavirus-vaccine-gavi,"Vaccines for Covid-19 are coming. Billions of dollars are flowing in, over 100 efforts are under way, and at least 13 leading candidates are already being tested on humans. But how will these vaccines reach the poorest people on the planet? This question haunts the fate of more than half the world’s population. It is the central question of our time. The failure to address this question in the past has resulted in millions of unnecessary deaths – and yet, some believe there is a simple answer. Ask pharmaceutical corporations about how they will ensure access to Covid-19 vaccines, and they say “Gavi”. Ask the wealthiest governments in the world what they are doing to ensure global equity, and they too say “Gavi”. Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, is a 20-year old public-private partnership that believes the marriage of markets and philanthropy will bring vaccines to everyone in the world. The numbers are impressive: every year, Gavi sends out 500 million vaccine doses against 17 different diseases. The sums of money pumped into Gavi are equally impressive. At the Global Vaccine Summit held earlier this month, Gavi raised a record-breaking $8.8bn. With £330m committed annually for the next five years, the British government is their single largest donor, alongside other wealthy countries and the Gates Foundation. At the summit, Gavi launched its newest initiative, a fund for future Covid-19 vaccines – the Covax Facility – which invites countries to invest in a wide portfolio of potential vaccines, pool their risk, and gain dedicated access to eventual products.
Gavi heavily publicised a unit of the Covax Facility called the Covax Advance Market Commitment (or AMC, and yes, it’s confusing) that deals with the access side of things. The first deal – a US$750m agreement with AstraZeneca for 300 million doses of the potential Oxford University vaccine – was heralded as a commitment by industry to meet the needs of the world’s poorest countries. But it came at a high price, representing only a minor discount over the full price paid by the US government. The problem is, we know very little about this deal because the agreement isn’t public, despite all the public money involved. We don’t know if, for example, AstraZeneca gets to keep the money if its vaccine fails. We don’t even know for a fact that all the vaccines bought are intended for use in poor countries. We asked AstraZeneca about this but did not receive a response in time for publication. At the summit, Gavi devoted considerably less attention to decisions made within the Covax Facility to make the fund attractive to rich countries. For instance, there is consensus that the most vulnerable people in the world be given the vaccines first and in a fair and equitable way, and the World Health Organization’s forthcoming Global Allocation Framework will specify how that can be done. And yet, a report prepared for the Gavi board meeting that starts this week, and circulated ahead by Gavi to stakeholders, including civil society organisations, proposes that rich countries can ignore the WHO framework, with only poor countries having to abide by it. According to the document, it seems Gavi will allocate rich countries enough vaccines for a fixed percentage of their population, which their “national advisory bodies” will decide. Poor countries, meanwhile, will only get vaccines for their highest priority people, after demonstrating proof. Rich countries are “encouraged (but not required)” to donate vaccines if they have more than they need, but we do not know when poor countries will get these donated vaccines: will it be at the same time as the rich countries, or only after they have used up all the vaccines they need? We put the questions raised by this document to Gavi, but it was unable to provide answers before this week’s board meeting. The prospect of a two-tiered system puts into question the fundamental issue that Gavi was founded to address: equitable access to vaccines. In many ways, Gavi has helped create the problem it is now trying to solve. Three decades of getting medicines and vaccines to poor people have revealed the problem and the solution: monopolies over vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry, enforced through patents which, when suspended, result in prices going down and supply going up. The rich countries and organisations who fund Gavi are equally culpable: the US, UK and EU have committed billions towards vaccine research, almost all of which has gone to private pharmaceutical companies – without any conditions to prevent them from monopolising their vaccines. All these countries have further stockpiled future vaccines by making direct deals with manufacturers, again without any access conditions whatsoever. In failing to challenge the most perverse feature of the pharmaceutical industry – monopolies that block access to their products – Gavi is in step with the governments who fund it. At best, Gavi has failed at negotiating control over the vaccines it funds. At worst, it believes that pharmaceutical monopolies, which have thwarted equitable access, are somehow essential to achieving it.
And unaffordable prices are only one part of the monopoly problem; in this pandemic, expanding supply is a major challenge. We have a shot at making enough vaccines for everyone, everywhere, if we put the planet’s full manufacturing capacity to use. But that can only happen if the vaccines are set free. Gavi’s inability to consider this problem, or use its leverage to force a solution, is baffling. Pharmaceutical companies say they will make no money off the pandemic, that they will supply vaccines at a cost. Yet, they have already seen multibillion dollar increases in their market capitalisation, and are unwilling to relinquish the monopolies that drive their outsize profits. Leaders of rich countries (apart from the US) have said all the right things about equitable access to vaccines. Yet they are entering into multiple advance deals to stock up on possibly far more vaccines than they will ever need. They cannot have it both ways, and neither can Gavi. Seth Berkley, the Gavi CEO, cannot claim to want “the world to come together” with “no barriers” while failing to tackle both rich country nationalism and pharmaceutical industry greed. Gavi can change the rules of the game and turn the Covid-19 vaccine into a global public good. It can ask far more of the pharmaceutical companies it is funding, and it can force the entire vaccine ecosystem to join a cooperative, collaborative and monopoly-free mechanism like the WHO’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. This would be the right move to make, and in doing so, Gavi could finally deliver on the promise it made to the world 20 years ago.

103425,commentisfree/2020/jun/24/boris-johnson-ease-lockdown-england,Opinion,The way Boris Johnson has eased lockdown sends all the wrong messages | Stephen Reicher,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/24/boris-johnson-ease-lockdown-england,"At the last daily press conference on Covid-19, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, pleaded with the public: “If people don’t take mitigation seriously, if people hear a distorted version of what’s been said – that says ‘this is all fine now, it’s gone away’ – and start behaving in ways that they normally would have before this virus happened, yes we will get an uptick for sure. So it is absolutely critical that people stick to the guidance that has been given.”
It was a candid admission that behavioural issues are central to what happens next, and that the good sense of the population is all that stands between us and disaster. After all, the virus hasn’t gone away, infection levels are roughly where they were shortly before lockdown, and if we return to business as usual we will rapidly waste all the sacrifices of the last three months. It was also a deeply ironic moment, given that this administration has systematically underestimated the resilience of the British public, invoked their lack of staying power to delay lockdown, and was then surprised at the extent to which people obeyed restrictions despite considerable hardship for many. In effect, the government now has to rely on those they dismissed in order to save their skin. But the problem is that the easing of lockdown measures announced by the government on Tuesday, which included a reduction of the 2-metre rule, endanger adherence to the remaining restrictions. People may have the willpower to endure hard times when they are convinced that it is necessary. But the evidence from past pandemics shows that they won’t abide by restrictive rules if they think that the danger has gone away. And while Whitty might argue that this is a distorted version of the government’s position, the problem is that actions can speak louder than words. Whatever the prime minister might say, his policies lead to banner headlines such as Freedom Pass and Independence Day. But we don’t even need to read the papers. Every time we pass an open bar, it will scream to us that the danger is all but gone and we are “back to normal”. After all, who in their right mind would reopen the pubs and abandon distancing in the midst of a deadly pandemic? But perhaps that is overstating things a little. After all, the government isn’t abandoning all distancing measures. It is saying 1 metre is acceptable when 2 metres is impossible, as long as other measures are applied. True. However, research in the field of proxemics – the study of space and social interaction – shows that, in the UK, 1 metre is roughly the distance we ordinarily maintain with others. So reducing it to 1 metre is akin to removing any restrictions from distancing, and hence functions as another signal of back to normal. Moreover, even if 1 metre is the distance you start out at from someone, human bodies are not static. We draw in to those whom we see as alike, and to those we like. One metre quickly becomes half a metre. Limbs move. People touch. And, even before we start factoring in the use of alcohol, all semblance of restriction flies out of the window. As stressed in a paper by the new behavioural advisory group to Independent Sage, the 2 metre to 1 metre reduction and the other changes announced for 4 July won’t only lead to an increased physical transmission of infection at a time when we are far from being out of the woods. They also undermine the psychological resolve we need to deal with the pandemic. But although we counselled against a change, the change has been made. So what should happen now? The first thing is to abandon the bombast and the unbalanced optimism of “sending the virus packing in 12 weeks” and to be realistic about the situation we are in. It is a situation of considerable fragility and danger. We may have exchanged the blunt instrument of lockdown for the more targeted strategy of test, trace and isolate (rather prematurely perhaps when the testing system is far from fully functional) but that isn’t an “easing” or a “relaxation”. Rather it is a contract that, in return for lifting some restrictions, requires greater adherence in other ways.
Second, we need a massive effort to ramp up the testing system and drive down rates of infection. This is not just about logistics: it is also about understanding the barriers to adherence at every level, from acknowledging your symptoms early, getting tested and revealing all your contacts, to fully self-isolating if contacted. And to achieve that, we need to involve all sections of the community in developing the system and to deliver it through local systems they know and trust. Third, we need to provide the material support to those we are asking to self-isolate at a time when everyone else is going out. This goes way beyond a vague promise that no one should be disadvantaged. It means bold and imaginative schemes involving all sections of society – government, business and local communities – to provide positive incentives to those who isolate themselves for the good of society. In sum, it isn’t enough to express a fond hope that people will stick to guidance. It is now more necessary than ever to apply our understandings of human behaviour in order to provide the motivation, the information and practical resources for people to do the right thing. Then, despite government policies, the public may (not for the first time) come to the rescue of our country’s response to Covid-19. • Stephen Reicher is a psychology professor and member of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee advising the government on behavioural issues",2020-06-24 12:25:59+00:00,103426,2

Announcing a further lifting of the lockdown that he imposed belatedly at the end of March, Mr Johnson told parliament that “our long national hibernation is coming to an end”. One backbencher cried “hallelujah” as it was announced that pubs would reopen on 4 July. The upbeat tone was understandable. The prospect of a pint in a pub, a meal in a restaurant or an overnight stay with relatives will lift spirits in a way that would have seemed inconceivable three months ago. The nation is desperate to have a haircut and exit a kind of collective purdah that, by and large, has been dutifully observed. It is also true, as the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, observed, that the risks of prolonging stringent restrictions – for the economy, schooling and mental health – were very real. But while the direction of travel is welcome, the timing is suspect. Mr Johnson is justified in saying that the pandemic now appears to be under control. But as one World Health Organization expert told Radio 4’s Today programme, this is precisely the moment at which the country needs to be “super-careful” in what it does next. Unfortunately, with this slapdash prime minister and government, therein lies the rub. It is hard to avoid a queasy sense that, in a race to head off a terrible recession, lockdown is being exited somewhat on the fly and corners are being cut. The reduction of the physical distancing rule from 2 metres to 1 metre-plus, albeit with supplementary precautions intended to mitigate the impact, was transparently driven by the desire to help the hospitality industry open up. At Tuesday’s Downing Street press conference, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, conspicuously failed to offer full-throated support for the move. There are other grey areas and hopeful assumptions. The new guidelines for pubs, which may involve registering patrons’ details and discouraging prolonged face-to-face contact, seem ambitious to say the least. Self-policing the new physical distancing regime during exuberant summer nights out will also be a mighty challenge. The danger is that the new normal will start to look too much like the old normal, at a time when Britain’s Covid-19 numbers are lower but still substantial. Another 171 deaths were reported on Tuesday. The daily number of new infections in the United Kingdom is steadily declining but still averaging over 1,000 – significantly more than France or Italy. A serious resurgence of cases this week in one part of Germany, which has handled this pandemic so much better than Britain, underlines the stakes. Test and trace, deployed to great effect in Germany, is still not properly in place in England. There are concerns over ongoing delays in processing test results. The NHS contact-tracing app, described as crucial in April by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been abandoned. Manual contact tracing is still a work in progress. According to the head of the NHS Confederation, current arrangements are “some way short of an effective system”. The consequence is that the country’s exit from lockdown in July will be a bigger gamble than it may have been at a later stage. In weighing the risks to public health of easing lockdown against the economic risks of not doing so, Mr Johnson has opted to prioritise the economy and hope his bet pays off. The prime minister said that the government’s guiding principle would be to trust people to “use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks”. As a scramble takes place to bring the test-and-trace insurance strategy up to speed, the country can only hope his faith in the public is borne out.",2020-06-23 18:37:07+00:00,103562,67
103814,commentisfree/2020/jun/22/pandemic-zero-coronavirus-britain,Opinion,The pandemic is not over – we need to push now for a zero-coronavirus Britain | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/22/pandemic-zero-coronavirus-britain,"As we see the return of the sunshine this week, and as the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the UK continues to fall, it can feel as if the worst of the pandemic is over. Far from relaxing, the government should be using this respite to make long-term plans on how to coexist with the virus until a vaccine can be found. Time is running out – when the cold and damp weather sets in, the virus will thrive. Test, trace and isolate schemes will be stretched as soon as flu symptoms rise and overlap with Covid-19 symptoms. Avoiding a second lockdown must be the imperative to ensure that the sacrifices made by the British public over the past 13 weeks do not go to waste. Currently the government’s drive to open up as quickly as possible bears a risk of another increase in infections, similar to what is being experienced in several US states such as Florida, Arizona and Texas, and in Iran. Ian Diamond, the UK’s national statistician, warned that the UK currently faces 3,000-4,000 new infections per day and only a fraction of those are being picked up through the test and protect scheme. By allowing the virus to spread during the summer months the government is creating a ticking time bomb that will go off as autumn arrives. Covid-19 is too dangerous to let spread through a population unchecked. Not only because of the difficulty of staying within health service capacity and overall mortality, but also because of the morbidity it entails. The FT has estimated that 65,000 excess deaths have occurred so far during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. In addition, an increasing number of long-term health complications are being seen in those who have recovered from the virus, and often in those who were healthy previously. Covid-19 is not the flu, but a multi-system disease that has surprised doctors in how it presents and how it develops within the human body. Important questions about immunity remain about whether re-infection is possible, or even immune enhancement where individuals get a more severe version of the same virus upon repeated exposure, such as with dengue fever. That is not to say countries should remain in lockdown until a vaccine is discovered, given the economic and social costs. Instead, each country will need to find the “least worst” path out of this situation based on their populations, public health system and capacity. An increasing number of countries are trying to suppress the virus to a low level and, where possible, eliminate it before reopening their schools, shops and restaurants. Not only New Zealand, but also Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and countries in east Asia. Once the virus has all but disappeared, governments in these nations are able to identity imported cases – such as the two women who travelled from the UK who reintroduced Covid-19 to New Zealand – and limit their spread. It is possible to both eliminate the virus and reopen economies – but it has to be done cautiously and with close monitoring. As an island, Great Britain is in a strong position to eliminate the virus and fully reopen schools, bars and theatres as well as bringing back sports matches and weddings, without pointless debates about 1 or 2 metre distancing measures. This would require mass testing – to catch all symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers – tracing of contacts and isolation for those individuals. The public needs to be convinced that the short-term pain is worth it, including continued physical distancing from others, use of face masks when distancing is not possible, and putting aside short-term self-interest for a few more months. Local dashboards should be created using the first part of postcodes, so individuals can understand transmission within their communities and ensure their behaviour contributes to a downwards push. Covid-19 will burn itself out if it has no other hosts to transmit it.
A clear push towards a “zero coronavirus” Britain should have been the priority when the country went into late lockdown on 23 March. And while other countries raced ahead with testing and tracing, and border control, and face masks, the UK government seemed to think that locking down alone was the solution, instead of a window of extremely costly time to aggressively go after the virus and drive it out. As a Chinese colleague told me in early March, implement key public health measures now and you’ll be out of the woods by mid-June. The UK government has missed chance after chance to suppress this virus and reopen the economy as quickly as possible. The summer months offer it a narrow timeframe to reassess its overall strategy in managing this outbreak. It feels like decisions are being made based on polling to see how this affects government approval ratings, rather than based on what is needed to get through this crisis. Planning and leadership are required to look at where the country needs to be, then work back from that to implement the key measures to get there. All of our lives, jobs and futures depend on it. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh • This article was amended on 23 June 2020.

What we do know is that we have a long way to go and there are many challenges that lie ahead of us. Although many countries have managed to gain control over virus transmission for now, these past few weeks in Victoria have highlighted how quickly things can turn and how little it takes for a resurgence in case numbers to occur. There is still much that we don’t understand completely, including key matters like how it affects the body and the way the immune system responds to infection. But every day we spend with this virus we are gaining a greater understanding of it, which means we are better placed to bring this pandemic under control and save lives. Here are five of the most important things we’ve learnt so far. 1. A global pandemic is not just science fiction
Up until now many of us have thought that a viral pandemic of this scale was just a recurring Hollywood science fiction movie plot. Despite the warnings of epidemiologists for years, we have only now come to truly appreciate how much of a threat this type of event is. Although we’ve had a taste of what pandemics look like, with Sars, H1N1 influenza and Ebola, none of these diseases compare with Covid-19 in terms of reach and impact. For the first time since the 1918 flu pandemic, the world has seen a disease both highly infectious and severe representing a global threat to health. And what we’ve seen so far has confirmed our worst fears: the virus is spreading rapidly, overwhelming health systems and resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. 2. The pandemic is not just a health crisis Previous pandemics have shown that these are cataclysmic world events that do not just affect the health of the population, but rather all aspects of society. This is what we are seeing now as we now find ourselves having to navigate the cumulative effect of a global health emergency paired with a global recession. There is no doubt that substantial challenges lay ahead and the effects will most certainly outlast the virus itself. Already we’ve seen major changes in, for example, the way we interact with each other, the way we work, the way we study, and the way we access healthcare. Despite the extensive challenges, the pandemic has also revealed how adaptive and resilient we can be individually and as communities when faced with adversity. While technology has been vital in allowing us to navigate a number of issues caused by the pandemic, it is also clear that it can’t address them all. 3. Things turn out better if we listen to experts The pandemic has confirmed the value of listening to experts. Those governments that listened to public health experts and epidemiologists have had dramatically better outcomes than those who ignored them. In particular, countries that took on board advice to act quickly and decisively have been able to get on top of disease transmission and save thousands of lives. We’ve seen that even delaying action by days can be the difference between restricting the disease’s spread and seeing it spread uncontrollably. There are no better examples of the effect of early and decisive action than looking at what Australia and New Zealand have been able to achieve in bringing disease spread under control. In contrast, countries like the UK and the US have paid a high price for not listening to the experts, being in denial in the early stages of the pandemic, and delaying action. 4. Pandemics do not affect all people equally
Pandemics expose inequalities – both between countries and within countries. Poorer countries will suffer the most due to Covid-19. These countries, with their weak health systems, lack of resources and large vulnerable populations, will find it more difficult to cope with a shock of this magnitude. In addition to the health and economic costs faced by all countries, many of these poorer ones are also at risk of food security, employment and political crises. The same disproportionate burden of this pandemic on the most disadvantaged is being seen within wealthy countries. There is no better example of this than the plight of black Americans in the catastrophe that is unfolding in many parts of the US. With greater levels of poverty, poorer access to health services, andhigher rates of co-morbidities, black Americans are being disproportionally affected by Covid-19, both in terms of health and economic impacts. 5. Making a vaccine is not an easy thing to do The pandemic has taught us that making a vaccine to Covid-19 – despite the vast technological and medical advances made in recent times – is going to be extremely difficult. It doesn’t matter how much money or effort we throw at this, there is a possibility that we may not succeed. And if we do, it may take longer than we all are hoping for. You only need to look at the story of HIV/Aids to get a reality check on how difficult it is to produce a vaccine. We have been working on an HIV/Aids vaccine for more than 30 years and have poured billions of dollars into this and we still haven’t succeeded. Still, with governments, scientists and pharmaceutical companies working together in a way we have not seen before, and on a scale we have not previously seen, there is cause for hope. We have more than 100 vaccine candidates now being tested and many of these have reached the human trial stage already. We only need one of these to be successful for it to be a game-changer. • Hassan Vally is an epidemiologist and associate professor in public health at La Trobe University",2020-07-31 20:00:23+00:00,103991,2

He says he is squeezing the brake pedal; England is experiencing whiplash. In less than 24 hours, it has seen an abrupt halt and a U-turn on the relaxation of coronavirus rules. On Thursday night, the government imposed new restrictions on 4 million people across Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire and West Yorkshire, preventing them from socialising with other households. Then, at noon on Friday, the prime minister announced a partial postponement of the national loosening scheduled for Saturday. Permission for indoor performances, bowling alley reopenings and close-up treatments at beauty salons was suspended until at least 15 August. From 8 August, people will also be obliged to wear masks in indoor venues such as museums, as well as shops. The changes follow last weekend’s decision to impose quarantine on people returning from Spain with only a few hours’ notice. For many people, these abrupt and mostly poorly communicated changes have been disruptive and damaging, costing them much-needed wages and the chance to see loved ones – especially upsetting for Muslim families poised to celebrate Eid together. Anger is understandable. But these shifts are necessary as infections rise again. It is thought that one in 1,500 people now have Covid-19, compared with one in 2,000 four weeks ago. We have seen the costs of a leisurely response: people pay with their lives. Thanks to the government’s tardiness in imposing lockdown, England had the highest excess death levels in Europe by the end of May. The real problem is not the tightening of restrictions but the premature rush to relaxation on many fronts which preceded it, and the message sent by Mr Johnson’s foolhardy prediction that things might be back to normal, without even distancing, by Christmas. Indeed, it is appalling that the government is pressing ahead with suspending the shielding programme, effectively forcing vulnerable people back to work. Its decision to urge people back to workplaces from Saturday is questionable at best, especially given the outbreaks we have seen in such locations. Strikingly, while Mr Johnson focused on personal responsibility – handwashing, distancing, mask wearing, and testing and self-isolating if symptomatic – the chief medical officer warned that the country is reaching the limits of relaxation. If we want to do more of some things we may have to do less of others, Chris Whitty said, citing schools as a priority: “The idea we can open everything up and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.” There is a whiff of the government blaming the public here. People should stick by the rules, as many are doing. But it is entirely understandable if they are now confused about what those rules are, and if they concluded from the prime minister’s boosterism that life was essentially getting back to normal. More noxious still would be singling out vulnerable communities. The high death rate in Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities reflects entrenched inequalities; the head of the British Medical Association has suggested that discrimination may also play a part. Yet when invited to disown comments from one of his MPs blaming BAME communities for the “vast majority” of lockdown breaches, Mr Johnson did not do so, saying only that everyone should comply with guidance. This failure further undermines what sense of national unity has survived his refusal to remove his adviser, Dominic Cummings, over his trips to and around Durham at the height of lockdown. Faced with a road this bumpy, it would be comforting if we had more confidence in the man at the wheel.",2020-07-31 17:30:19+00:00,104009,2
104101,world/commentisfree/2020/jul/31/the-northern-lockdown-represents-government-failure-on-a-massive-scale-covid-19,Opinion,The northern lockdown represents government failure. There is a better way | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/jul/31/the-northern-lockdown-represents-government-failure-on-a-massive-scale-covid-19,"More than 4 million people in the north of England woke up on Friday morning to the news that coronavirus restrictions were being reimposed. This follows the local lockdown in Leicester. Such measures are entirely predictable and a glimpse of the pattern of lockdown and release that will occur over the coming weeks and months as the government attempts to avoid a second peak in infections. While it might be an effective way to stop the spread of the infection once it has got out of hand, the government’s whack-a-mole approach will slowly strangle the economy, as small businesses collapse under the uncertainty and larger ones have to let people go. It will also undermine social cohesion, as increasing numbers of people refuse to abide by what they see as capricious, complicated rulings. To fix this, the government needs to look six to eight months ahead and make a clear plan for how to best get through this crisis with the least loss of life, the healthiest possible economy and the least overwhelmed health service. It’s crucial to do this thinking before the winter hits. In short, lockdowns should be a last-resort measure when the frontline outbreak responders – the local testing and tracing teams – can no longer suppress the infection sufficiently.
There are tough decisions ahead. In the absence of a vaccine, people must realise that they cannot have it all. We can either have our daily lives back with borders largely closed, or we can have free movement and constant outbreaks. It’s important when weighing this up to realise that the biggest problem for the economy is not lockdown. It is the virus itself. Front-loading deaths from this disease does not “save” the economy, as Sweden has painfully learned, and buying time can lead to treatments such as dexamethasone, which would have saved the lives of many of those who died. “Herd immunity” has thankfully also been taken off the table, given uncertainty about levels of protection, long-term health complications for survivors and the prolonged strain on health services. Thursday’s figures revealed 846 new infections in the UK, the highest total for more than a month. But a closer look at that picture gives us a clue as to what direction to take. Only 34 of those infections came from Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland – the rest came from England. Since Scotland started pursuing an “elimination” strategy, infections declined and are now estimated to be seven to 10 times fewer per capita than in England. Current modelling estimates 10 to 30 daily new infections in Scotland versus 2,800 new infections per day in England. Scotland has reported no confirmed Covid-19 deaths for 14 days, and Northern Ireland for 16 days. Scotland and Northern Ireland are pursuing a “zero Covid” objective, aiming to eliminate community transmission. But they won’t be able do it without a coordinated approach across the UK. Cooperation is essential – if only one part doesn’t go for elimination, the others can’t do it either. We all win together, or we all lose together. Going for a zero Covid-19 Britain means setting an objective with a timeline, forming a gameplan, appointing a high-level official to oversee things and just getting on and doing it using local authorities and expertise. The key is to use physical distancing measures to drive case numbers down and then use a robust testing and tracing system to figure out who has the virus and then get them into isolation during the infectious phase so they don’t pass it on to others. This is classic outbreak control and it is how viruses have been controlled in the past. It requires a focus on clearing the virus completely from those parts of the country that have only a few cases (south-west England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland), emulating the Australian and Chinese approaches by limiting non-essential travel in and out of these areas, and then engaging in a concerted effort to get the Midlands and north-west under control. It also requires strict measures at borders including testing at arrival and five days later, enforced quarantine and tracking of all imported cases. In this way, those places with very few cases could effectively return to normal life. I have studied outbreaks in poorer countries such as Haiti, Senegal, India and Tanzania, so I am conscious what a privileged position we are in Britain, with our enormous wealth and resources. Why not make the choice to make the UK a beacon of suppression, a success in the fight against Covid-19, a model for others? The government owes it to the people of Greater Manchester and beyond to find a better way. • Devi Sridhar is a professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2020-07-31 11:06:54+00:00,104102,2

In England, and other European nations hit hard by coronavirus, bars and cafes have reopened, and people have begun to fly abroad again for holidays. Guests have gathered for weddings. Babies have met their grandparents for the first time. Though many remain wary, the government’s keenness to get back to business has encouraged a dangerous sense of complacency; some are increasingly casual in following the rules. Less than two weeks ago, Boris Johnson made the remarkable suggestion that there could be a “return to normality” by Christmas, with even distancing requirements dropped. Now the prime minister has warned there are signs of a second wave in Europe. Spain’s sharp rise in cases has already prompted England to reimpose quarantine for returning travellers; it may soon do so for Belgium, Luxembourg and Croatia. Niall Dickson, who heads the NHS Confederation – representing NHS leaders – has told MPs that managers are very worried about a second spike, perhaps before winter, citing exhausted staff and the need to rebuild other services. Hong Kong, which has kept a relatively tight lid on infections until now, is on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak, according to its chief executive, which could lead to the collapse of the hospital system. Vietnam – which has so far recorded no deaths – reported its first case for three months at the weekend; now it is bracing for a surge after dozens more in multiple locations. Others have seen no pause. The US reopening was vastly premature – as 4 million confirmed cases and a death toll of 150,000 attest. In India and Brazil, the virus is flourishing. Though some poorer countries have put wealthy nations to shame with exemplary initial responses, coronavirus will wreak its most devastating damage in communities with overcrowded conditions, poor sanitation and healthcare, malnutrition and no social safety net. The global picture underscores that we are not, in truth, facing a new wave, but a continuation or resurgence: the pandemic is “one big wave”, says World Health Organization spokesperson Margaret Harris. But she also made it clear that, while it might be accelerating, it is not an inexorable force sweeping all before it. It can and must be flattened. Another worldwide lockdown is neither possible nor desirable, given its costs. But the alternative is not resignation, abandoning the most vulnerable to take their chances. It is for governments to redouble efforts. They must work together, and encourage their citizens to pull together. One hope is that governments and communities are better prepared for a resurgence thanks to the test and trace strategies they have developed, and increased public awareness of how to reduce the risk of infection. Another is that they are learning from what they and others got wrong the first time round. The UK’s failure to protect care homes saw them “thrown to the wolves”, in the words of the public accounts committee. In Hong Kong, the president of the medical association has criticised the high level of exemptions from quarantine. But if Mr Johnson is as concerned as he says, it is baffling that the government wants to urge people who can work remotely back into workplaces, and is still encouraging people to book holidays. Two epidemiologists have suggested the UK could eliminate coronavirus if it stops overseas tourism. The threat of a resurgence is all the more reason for England and Wales to seriously consider the Independent Sage group’s “Zero Covid” approach, already adopted by Scotland and Northern Ireland. With no vaccine yet available, a sensible government would pause the relaxation of restrictions while it takes stock, and discourage people from holidaying abroad as cases grow. It would clarify guidelines to make them more understandable, and throw itself into effective social media campaigns to remind people of the difference that mask wearing, proper distancing and handwashing make. Meanwhile, it would ensure that it has adequate supplies of protective gear, medical equipment and the necessary medicines. Individuals, too, must do their part by following official advice. England should have been better prepared for coronavirus to hit in spring. It has no excuses this time.",2020-07-29 18:25:08+00:00,104469,2
104557,commentisfree/2020/jul/29/britain-ditches-overseas-travel-coronavirus-spanish-covid-19,Opinion,"If Britain ditches overseas holidays, we can eliminate coronavirus | David Hunter and Neil Pearce",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/29/britain-ditches-overseas-travel-coronavirus-spanish-covid-19,"Last weekend’s rapid government U-turn over travel to Spain has left both tourists and holiday companies reeling. Who can be sure of flying to any country if a quarantine can be imposed at such short notice? Arguments are now raging over whether the government acted too impulsively and failed to consider the consequences. Yet, for the most part, these all miss an essential point: that encouraging travel abroad in the middle of a pandemic makes no epidemiological sense. With every arriving overseas visitor or returning holidaymaker, the risk of bringing Covid-19 into the country increases. The government has so far justified allowing this travel because it believes community transmission of the virus in the UK is inevitable until a vaccine arrives. It is not. Great Britain and the island of Ireland are just that – islands. Other islands, such as New Zealand and Taiwan, have shown that the Covid-19 virus can be eliminated like the first Sars virus. In these countries, life is going on largely as usual with families gathering, full stands at sporting events, and internal economies almost back to normal. Shakespeare called England: “This fortress built by nature for herself against infection.” And now the Independent Sage committee (which shadows Britain’s official science advisory group) and other experts have called for a goal of zero coronavirus – elimination of the virus – rather than settling for suppression. Of course, both New Zealand and Taiwan avoided substantial “first waves” – making their tasks much easier. Both also scaled up their public health workforces to aggressively test, trace and isolate cases and their contacts. But both, even now, have mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for incoming travellers. Yes, international tourism has dried up, but it has been replaced by domestic tourism. And despite this, these countries are hardly isolated – the proportion of Taiwan’s GDP accounted for by external trade is double that of the UK and continues largely uninterrupted. Can we replicate these successes in the UK and Ireland? Ireland and Scotland had large epidemics, with the death rate per million in Ireland being fractionally higher at its peak in late April than that of the UK. But both Ireland and Scotland have brought their infection and death rates down dramatically. Last week the Republic of Ireland reported 11 Covid-19 deaths, and Northern Ireland and Scotland reported none. England and Wales’ combined populations are five times higher than the other three countries’ total, yet the number of deaths in that week was many times greater. Ireland and Scotland demonstrate that the virus can be almost fully suppressed even after a strong first wave. Can we reach beyond that to elimination? There is a technocratic objection to the word “elimination”. In infectious disease circles it usually refers to absence of community transmission in a country or region, for some substantial period (for measles, it is 12 months). Because outbreaks may still occur, many specialists prefer the concepts of infection “control” or “suppression”. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, it seems reasonable to define elimination as a preliminary, though not necessarily durable, absence of community transmission. New Zealand has had no community-transmitted cases for nearly three months (all new cases have been in quarantined arrivals from overseas). In the context of a worldwide pandemic, as Australia has found, reintroduction of the virus from abroad is an ever-present threat. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has claimed that Scotland is “not far away” from eliminating coronavirus, and a committee of Irish scientists has called on their government to adopt a policy of virus elimination. Such a goal has three major advantages over suppression: absence of transmission means no Covid-19 illnesses and deaths; life and the economy can go back to a (guarded) level of normality; and it makes a second wave in the winter much less likely. So if we want to avoid a “November nightmare” and have a relatively “normal” Christmas, a push for elimination gives us the best chance.
But is elimination achievable? We think it is – though it would require major changes to the British government’s current thinking. A bold elimination goal would require further strengthening of the test, track and isolate system with clear, transparent and spin-free reporting of its successes and failures. The release of data to local public health authorities is a welcome first step. It would entail income support for people who are asked to self-isolate, and consideration of supervised hotel accommodation for those who represent a risk to their families. It would also require abandoning the troubled air-bridge system – the deficiencies of which are becoming increasingly clear. So, for British people planning their summer holidays, it would mean replacing trips abroad with UK travel. Of course, international airlines will need subsidies to avoid bankruptcy; it would also mean that lorries arriving in the UK would be driven to their destinations by British drivers. All this is a big ask. But the prize is huge. It would mean a relatively normal internal economy, with domestic tourists replacing international ones. The prize is getting children back to school; releasing our aged population from home isolation or confinement in care homes; protecting our black and minority-ethnic communities; revitalising the arts and sport. And a reduction in the probability of a second wave in the winter, crippling the NHS and requiring a second national lockdown. We all hope one or more vaccines will work and be relatively free of side-effects, but experience shows we cannot assume such a vaccine will be widely available any time soon. Compared to the costs, the benefits are huge. This prize is within our grasp. It’s up to our politicians to change course and seize it. • David Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford; Neil Pearce is professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine",2020-07-29 11:28:23+00:00,104558,2
104612,commentisfree/2020/jul/29/coronavirus-britain-infectious-diseases-flu-community,Opinion,"After coronavirus, will Britain finally take infectious diseases like flu seriously? | Devi Sridhar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/29/coronavirus-britain-infectious-diseases-flu-community,"If anything good comes of coronavirus, it might be a healthier and more resilient Britain. The UK was initially complacent about the virus, and several individuals first likened Covid-19 to a “bad flu”, perhaps because influenza was the most recent point of reference for a widespread infectious disease in richer countries. But even flu, which killed an average of 17,000 people annually in England between 2014-15 and 2018-19, has a tough time being taken seriously in the UK. That could all change. Britain learned the painful way that infectious disease outbreaks can devastate public health and the economy if not controlled properly. The strong state responses seen in east Asian countries are partly the result of their recent experiences. South Korea, which learned from its 2015 Mers outbreak, was far better prepared for Covid-19. Indeed, South Korea has recorded 299 deaths among a population of 51 million. Taiwan, where 37 people died of Sars in 2002, drew on its previous experience to swiftly contain coronavirus; it has counted seven Covid-19 deaths in a population of 23 million.
In contrast, Britain has recorded 45,752 deaths to Covid-19 among a population of 66 million. There are several things we can learn from east Asian countries, including the importance of developing systemic solutions, acting swiftly and showing humility in the face of a novel pathogen. This first wave of cases may teach Britain useful lessons for how it deals with future outbreaks, both of coronavirus and of influenza and the common cold. That includes ending the culture of people soldiering on and coming into work when they’re unwell. One survey from 2015 showed that 58% of managers didn’t think having flu was a valid excuse to skip work. This problem extends to schools and childcare facilities; some 63% of parents admitted sending unwell children to school because of workload pressures, according to one 2018 study. To prevent future outbreaks, the government should provide support and incentives so that symptomatic children and adults can stay home without suffering financially. In winter, when we will likely see a second wave of coronavirus cases, the overlap of Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and dry cough with classic flu symptoms including fatigue, sore throats and headaches will strain the testing system as people with flu present for Covid-19 tests. This makes rolling out the flu vaccine to a wider section of the population all the more important. Last year, about 15 million people were vaccinated in England, but this needs to increase to 30-35 million people to prevent infection and ease pressure on the NHS. Rising anti-vaccination sentiment makes uptake of the flu vaccine a problem. Encouraging more people to get the flu vaccine will require a concerted public education campaign to combat the misinformation about vaccines that circulates on social media. Preventing the future spread of infectious diseases will also require better access to handwashing facilities, ensuring sinks and soap are available in visible public spaces, such as parks, shopping centres, train stations, businesses and schools, not just in toilets. Even in places with scarce running water, countries such as Rwanda, Lesotho and Ethiopia have created innovative public hand-washing facilities that also offer free hand sanitiser.
In the longer term, tackling chronic health problems such as obesity will be crucial to making Britain a healthier country. Currently England has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe, with 63% of adults overweight or obese, and a third of children leaving primary school overweight or obese. The pandemic has exposed the dangers of chronic health problems including obesity; those with higher body mass indexes, as well as high blood pressure and diabetes, are more likely to die from Covid-19. To prepare for a second wave of cases this winter, the government has launched a new obesity strategy, with measures that include banning discount offers on unhealthy products, introducing calorie and nutritional labelling and expanding NHS services to support weight management. While these are welcome steps, they don’t go far enough (indeed, the government’s pre-watershed ban on junk food advertisements, announced as part of its obesity agenda, reportedly won’t be introduced for another two years). Fresh food such as fruits, vegetables, meat, lentils and eggs can be expensive, time-consuming to prepare and go off quickly. In contrast, processed foods, which are generally worse nutritionally, are geared towards affordability and flavour, and can last for months or even years. Nudging people towards healthier options or providing them with more information isn’t enough – there needs to be a concerted, systematic push to make it easier for people to eat healthily by addressing the price of nutritious food and the fact many people don’t have enough time to prepare it. Perhaps the real lesson from Covid-19 is that less of a focus on individual self-interest and more consideration for the collective health of our community will make Britain healthier. Face coverings are a great example of this collective spirit: I wear a mask to protect you, and you wear one to protect me. Infectious disease outbreaks reveal how each of us is only as healthy as our neighbour, as the person we sit next to on the bus, and as the strangers we shop with in a supermarket. If coronavirus teaches Britain to think collectively instead of selfishly, it will be a huge step towards a better, healthier country. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2020-07-29 06:00:23+00:00,104613,2
104804,commentisfree/2020/jul/28/coronavirus-smallpox-vaccine-eradicated,Opinion,"The best lessons on eradicating coronavirus come not from Spanish flu, but smallpox | Stephanie DeGooyer and Srinivas Murthy",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/28/coronavirus-smallpox-vaccine-eradicated,"Since the outbreak of Covid-19 experts and commentators have often invoked the Spanish flu of 1918 as a useful precedent. But with various drug companies moving toward the advanced stages of vaccine testing, we should now shift our attention to the history of smallpox. Though smallpox is a different, and more deadly, pathogen than the coronavirus, the international politics that gripped the campaign for its global eradication during the 20th century offer valuable lessons for the coming struggle we will face distributing a coronavirus vaccine. In 1958, the World Health Organization initiated a plan to rid the world of smallpox. The virus had long been stamped out in rich countries, but it still ravaged populations in Brazil, South Asia, Africa and Indonesia. At a World Health Assembly meeting that year, Dr Viktor Zhdanov, the deputy minister for health in the Soviet Union, urged delegates to consider the cost-to-benefit ratio of a global campaign to eliminate smallpox. Not only would working together to eradicate the virus help to keep all nations safe, it would also eliminate the costs of their annual vaccination programmes. But the United States, the WHO’s biggest funding contributor, did not support the programme. Many other nations that thought smallpox vaccination was the responsibility of individual countries let it go unfunded as well. Eradicating smallpox would remain an idea on paper only until, seven years and two presidents later, Lyndon Johnson was moved to sign a renewed version of the campaign, pledging “American support for an international programme to eradicate smallpox completely from the earth within the next decade”. Thanks to this financial aid, and a donation of 1.7bn doses from the Soviet Union, smallpox was eventually extinguished from the planet in 1977. As we await news of a successful vaccine for Covid-19, Zhdanov’s advice about the international cooperation needed to fight a deadly virus has never been more timely. Whether politicians will heed his words remains to be seen. There have been some positive signs. In an interview with the activist Ady Barkan, Joe Biden said that if he were elected president of the US he would “absolutely” commit to widely sharing technology and access to an unpatented Covid-19 vaccine. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, leaders from across the world, including Justin Trudeau, Sahle-Work Zewde and Cyril Ramaphosa, proclaimed “global solidarity” for vaccine development and distribution. These leaders are all signatories of Covax, an initiative of Gavi, a vaccine alliance run by the WHO, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The alliance has initiated a vaccine pool, which allows participating countries to back a larger number of vaccine candidates while helping poorer nations secure shares. But Covax lacks the support of some of the world’s richest countries, and Biden is still only a presidential candidate making promises that are not yet his to keep. Instead of multilateral cooperation, many of the most powerful countries have been seeking preferential access to promising vaccines through licensing agreements. Last week, the US contracted with Pfizer for up to 600m doses of their vaccine, and the EU has made a deal with AstraZeneca for 400m doses. This bilateral bargaining will make it hard for the Covax plan to proceed: if rich countries buy up all the early stock, there will be little vaccine to be distributed elsewhere. Also, the Covax plan might allow rich countries to double-dip, buying vaccines for themselves through private deals while gaining vaccination for 20% of their population through the alliance. Appeals to social justice and human rights, though important, are not likely to remedy these inequities. As the smallpox eradication programme demonstrated, self-interest has often proved to be the most compelling reason for nations to care about a global vaccination programme. Vaccination campaigns in poorer countries meant rich nations didn’t have to pay for the continued vaccination of their own population or for more surveillance of the virus at their borders. But the fight against smallpox also saw loftier principles work in tandem with self-interest. Reeling from the international shame of the Vietnam war, Johnson was keen to support the campaign to show the US’s renewed commitment to the world. He signed on and, in the middle of the cold war, the USSR agreed to supply the 1.7bn doses. For this reason alone the WHO, and the planet at large, is right to celebrate smallpox eradication as a momentous victory for international cooperation. Can coordination of this magnitude ever happen again? As in 1958, it is unlikely the US will lead the way. Donald Trump recently declared that the US would no longer fund the WHO, and America and China appear to be entering a new cold war. The recent accusation that China and Russia have been trying to steal vaccine formulations from American companies follows a string of xenophobic attacks on China that date back to when Trump labelled Covid-19 “a foreign virus” on 11 March. Perhaps Biden, if elected, will see himself as the heir to Johnson in the midst of Vietnam. Facing a world that has soured on America and “America first”, and newly chastened from its own coronavirus crisis, Biden may look to repair the damaged reputation of the US by working to create global supply chains for a vaccine. But at the moment our only hope for an equitable distribution plan lies with the countries that have partnered with Covax. Politicians, scientists, medical professionals and activists of all stripes must press governments around the world to close loopholes and address questions of how wealthy signatories and manufacturers will be held to account for their share. Through pooled resources, all nations, rich or poor, and all people, should have enough vaccine doses to at least protect their most vulnerable populations – and we cannot leave out the world’s growing refugee population. If the history of smallpox eradication teaches us anything, it is that distribution equality is just as important as the vaccine itself, if not more important. Once a vaccine was available for smallpox, disease control in poorer countries took generations to achieve, and was only accomplished with unprecedented global collaboration. The smallpox vaccine was unpatented. Today, drug company profiteers and their stockholders have privatised access to a global good, making equitable distribution harder and more expensive. If we don’t learn these lessons, we will end up living with the threat of this pandemic for decades to come. • Stephanie DeGooyer is ACLS Frederick Burkhardt fellow at UCLA and Srinivas Murthy is associate professor of infectious diseases and critical care at the University of British Columbia",2020-07-28 08:00:17+00:00,104805,2
104836,commentisfree/2020/jul/28/pandemic-era-rainforest-deforestation-exploitation-wildlife-disease,Opinion,We are entering an era of pandemics – it will end only when we protect the rainforest | Peter Daszak,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/28/pandemic-era-rainforest-deforestation-exploitation-wildlife-disease,"In late 2013, in the village of Meliandou in rural Guinea, a group of children playing near a hollow tree disturbed a small colony of bats hiding inside. Scientists think that Emile Ouamouno, who later became the first tragic “index” case in the west African Ebola outbreak, was likely exposed to bat faeces while playing near the tree. Every pandemic starts like this. An innocuous human activity, such as eating wildlife, can spark an outbreak that leads to a pandemic. In the 1920s, when HIV is thought to have emerged in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, scientists believe transmission to humans could have been caused by a bushmeat hunter cutting themselves while butchering a chimpanzee. In 2019, we can speculate that a person from south-west China entered a bat cave near their village to hunt wildlife for sale at the local wet market. Perhaps they later developed a nagging cough that represents the beginning of what we now know as Covid-19. Now, a growing human population, ever-encroaching development and a globalised network of travel and trade have accelerated the pace of pandemic emergence. We’re entering a new pandemic era. Most pandemics begin in the emerging disease hotspots of the world; the edges of forests in regions such as west Africa, the Amazon basin and south-east Asia. Tropical rainforests are home to a rich diversity of wildlife, which in turn carry an array of viruses. We know far more about these animals than we do about the viruses they carry. An estimated 1.7m viruses exist in mammals and birds (the origins of most pandemics), but less than 0.1% have been described. They spread to millions of people each year; though they often don’t cause noticeable symptoms, the sheer volume means that plenty can. Before humans became an agricultural species, our populations were sparser and less connected. A virus infecting a hunter-gatherer might only reach family members or perhaps a hunting group. But the Anthropocene, our new geological epoch, has changed everything. A great acceleration of human activity has dramatically altered our planet’s landscapes, oceans and atmosphere, transforming as much as half of the world’s tropical forest into agriculture and human settlements. About one-third of emerging diseases are the product of these rapid changes in land use, as people are pushed into contact with wildlife they would once have rarely encountered. The viruses that emerge, such as Zika, Ebola and Nipah, include the latest of our foes, Covid-19, transported from the altered rural landscape of China to a city near you. Human activity has created a continuous cycle of viral spillover and spread. Our current approach is to wait for outbreaks to start, and then design drugs or vaccines to control them. But as we’ve seen with Covid-19, this approach isn’t good enough: while we wait for a vaccine, hundreds of thousands of people have died, and millions have been infected. By the time the US produced sufficient doses to vaccinate against the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, the virus had already infected about a quarter of the people on our planet. If we are to prevent future pandemics, we will need to reassess our relationship with nature, blocking each step in the chain of disease emergence. This should begin with reducing the rampant consumption that drives deforestation and wildlife exploitation. We’ll also need to remove viral-risk species from wildlife markets, crack down on the illegal wildlife trade and work with communities to find alternatives. We should be putting more pressure on industries that harvest tropical timber and wildlife products, rewarding corporate sustainability and legislating against overconsumption. Consumer-led campaigns against palm oil, for example, have had a ripple effect on sustainability. In a recently published paper, a number of scientists, myself included, laid out the economic case for preventing the disease spillover that leads to pandemics by reducing deforestation and the wildlife trade. We estimate that the annual costs of programmes to reduce deforestation and the wildlife trade and build pandemic surveillance in disease hotspots would be $17.7–26.9bn, more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the current estimate cost of Covid-19 economic damages, of $8.1-15.8tn. Our costs include the collateral benefits of carbon sequestration by reducing forest loss. While the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the global economy, our current trajectory could see the cost of future pandemics rocket into the tens of trillions. As we rebuild our economies after the coronavirus pandemic, rather than returning to the system of unchecked consumption that brought us Covid-19, we have an opportunity to green our economies. Centuries of environmental exploitation have put us in a fragile position on this planet. While some may balk at the costs of avoiding environmental breakdown, or fail to understand the value of preserving a species of butterfly, frog or fish, most of us recognise that Covid-19 has brought death and economic misery on a global scale. Once we accept that human activity is what led to this, we may finally be empowered to escape the pandemic era. • Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics",2020-07-28 05:00:15+00:00,104837,2
105019,commentisfree/2020/jul/27/china-truth-coronavirus-panorama-xi-jinping,Opinion,China is rewriting the facts about coronavirus to suit its own narrative | Carrie Gracie,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/27/china-truth-coronavirus-panorama-xi-jinping,"China has been here before. During the Sars crisis in 2002 and 2003 it hid cases, censored doctors and withheld information from the world for four months. Nearly 800 people died.
Fast forward to 2020. The successor to Sars appeared, and has so far caused 600,000 deaths and more than 15 million infections worldwide. The Chinese government says it has been “open, transparent and responsible” throughout; its critics say not open, transparent or responsible enough to avert disaster. After Sars, China built a nationwide disease surveillance network and formidable bioscience capacity. It invested in research on bat coronaviruses. Disease control chiefs said it could stop another outbreak. But in 2020 none of these preparations were enough to offset risks coming from other directions: ever more rigid top-down politics inside China and a globetrotting population with direct international flights from Wuhan. Last December patients started turning up in Wuhan’s hospitals with pneumonia symptoms that didn’t respond to treatment. Doctors were quick to send samples for genetic sequencing which soon revealed a coronavirus closely resembling Sars. Chinese scientists warned the new virus was also contagious, spread by respiratory droplets and on surfaces. But both in Wuhan and in Beijing, health authorities sought to minimise the story, first insisting there was no reason to suspect the virus was transmitted by humans and later that the risk was low. Frontline doctors didn’t agree. They tried to warn each other on social media, but were swiftly silenced, some forced to sign police confessions that they had spread misinformation. The Hong Kong microbiologist Prof Yuen Kwok-yung had helped to identify Sars back in 2003. As soon as he saw the social media posts from Wuhan, he urged the Hong Kong government to take public health precautions. He told Panorama: “If you don’t make use of every hour, you are in big, big trouble.” Instead, from 31 December to 20 January, China’s political leaders played down the risks of the virus, squandering the lead their doctors and scientists had given them. Beijing is naturally sensitive about its early handling of what has gone on to become a global catastrophe. At home its censorship is so overwhelming that it can control the timeline and edit the facts to suit its narrative. Since January, censors have assiduously deleted documentary evidence and added events and comments retrospectively to suggest leadership engagement. Seven months on, the silencing of doctors and scientists continues, while some Chinese citizens who have tried to preserve inconvenient facts or present a different version of the narrative have disappeared. As a result, there is no meaningful challenge inside China to the official version of events. According to this version, as soon as Beijing had clear evidence of human transmission of the virus it publicly announced it, and prepared tough control measures including the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January. The truth is more complex. For example, Beijing certainly had a key part of its evidence on human transmission a week earlier than the official version admits. On 12 January, Yuen diagnosed a family with the novel coronavirus in Shenzhen, 700 miles from Wuhan. Only some members of the family had been to Wuhan. Yuen immediately alerted authorities in Beijing. But between the beginning of the year and the lockdown, 5 million people left Wuhan for destinations in China and beyond. Prof Andrew Tatem of the University of Southampton told Panorama: “If the same interventions that were put in place on 23 January had been put in place on 2 January, we may have seen a 95% reduction in the number of cases.” The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, told the BBC: “The Chinese health authorities notified WHO on 31 December in the shortest possible time.” In fact it was the WHO that had picked up reports of the outbreak on the internet – and on 1 January sought answers from the Chinese government. China responded two days later. China’s response time has been much faster than during the Sars outbreak 17 years ago, but most close observers of the Chinese Communist party say full transparency is never its first instinct and that under the leadership of Xi Jinping, information control has grown ever tighter. Challenged on the silencing of doctors and scientists in early January, a key government adviser, Prof Li Lanjuan, told us: “To announce its contagiousness, if it is not yet confirmed, would cause public panic. Therefore we must be responsible to the public, and ascertain the facts first.” Some governments have demanded an international investigation in China to determine the origins and early spread of the virus. The Chinese government says it will join a global inquiry into the pandemic but only when the crisis is over. It says it should not be blamed as it is a victim too, and that its tough measures to combat the Wuhan outbreak prevented hundreds of thousands of infections and bought the world time. Dr Ali Khan spent much of his career in the US Centers for Disease Control and says the world now needs to think ahead. “We can’t afford to do this again. If … some countries having an outbreak [are] deciding to not share that information, there have to be consequences.” But what consequences? The WHO’s regulations on protecting against the international spread of disease are legally binding, but there are no sanctions for countries that fail to adhere to them. In recent weeks, western governments have begun adopting a tougher tone towards Beijing on a range of issues, but there is little sign of a concerted international push for new WHO inspection powers to tackle future disease outbreaks. Indeed, the US has just withdrawn funding for the WHO, alleging that the global health body served as Beijing’s puppet during the early stages of coronavirus. For now, we are left hoping that China’s leadership has learned its own lessons about the need to act faster to protect its own public and the world. • Carrie Gracie is a BBC newsreader and presenter and former China editor for BBC News Panorama: China’s Coronavirus Cover-Up is on BBC One, Monday 27 July, 7.30pm",2020-07-27 08:43:57+00:00,105020,2

For us, there is no end in sight | Jemma Kennedy",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/26/im-a-covid-19-long-hauler-im-still-dealing-with-pain-fatigue-and-misery,"As a writer, I spend my days trying to craft believable, satisfying narratives. But as a Covid-19 “long-hauler”, I have given up trying to find an internal logic to the story of my illness. As we now know, thousands of people are suffering a range of bewildering and debilitating post-Covid symptoms that don’t follow any predictable act breaks or intervals. Happily, the recent news about the emergency rescue package for the UK’s cultural industries, including my own, was followed by the NHS announcing an online Covid-19 rehab service, promising a “personalised package of aftercare”. It’s a promising start, but we are still nowhere near understanding the long-term effects of this vicious, capricious virus.
I fell sick in mid-March. My diagnosis of “mild” Covid meant that I avoided going to hospital, but still needed three trips to A&E as the illness peaked. Frustratingly, my tests revealed the “normal” blood, heart, lung and organ function typical of long-haulers. But my body told me otherwise. For six weeks, it felt as though every cell had been poisoned, accompanied by constant chest pain and shortness of breath. During May, I recovered from the worst of it, only to be felled again by a bout of post-viral fatigue that is almost as bad as the disease itself. Before falling ill, I had enjoyed a stable, long-term relationship with my body. I nourished it with good food, exercise and sleep and it did more or less what I asked it to. Now it has turned on me. My heart, which had gone quietly about its vital work, like so many NHS and care workers, has become a showgirl, nightly pirouetting on the stage of my ribs. I dread going to sleep, which usually occurs sitting up, to avoid the crushing lung pain that comes when I lie flat. Months of viral gastroenteritis have left me with mild colitis of the bowel, necessitating a strict dietary regime; my head aches, my skin prickles, my fatigue covers me like a weighted blanket stitched from dead dogs. It’s hard to resist the pull of tragedy in the absence of medical answers. Last week, I gave in and spent all day in bed howling. My husband, now required to dress, wash and partially feed me, looked at me with resigned sorrow. “I don’t know how to help you,” he said. I didn’t know either – nobody did – hence the gnawing fear and depression, an ongoing symptom in itself. Thankfully, this low point of incapacitation has eased a little. Certain things are helping; a nutrition and supplement regime, acupuncture (good but expensive) and total rest (free but not good for the self-employed). As I move from bed to sofa and back again, I learn that Gwyneth Paltrow has designed a new £58 candle that smells like her orgasm. If I had the energy I would do the same but I’m not sure it would sell; my Covid candle has top notes of gluten-free oatcakes, middle notes of humid sheets and a base note of despair. And yet compared with many others, I am doing reasonably well. I don’t have small children, dependants or live alone. And I have work lined up for when I’m physically stronger – I can at least write by using a transcription app.
Countless others, however, will struggle to manage crippling post-viral symptoms without help. We don’t yet know if post-Covid recovery is worse according to gender, ethnicity or age, but we know that those who are poor or disadvantaged socially will suffer disproportionately. Jobs will be lost, long-term care may be needed. Will long-haulers be eligible for state financial support and free specialist medical care beyond the 12 weeks offered by the NHS? Can we avoid the battle faced by chronic fatigue or ME sufferers, our closest cousins, who have historically found it difficult to a) get diagnosed, b) treated and c) recognised as even having a bona fide disease? We long-haulers are also at the mercy of the medical establishment, which has not always responded to our dilemma with sympathy. George, a friend and fellow long-hauler, fought her GP for weeks to get a chest MRI, knowing that her lungs weren’t working properly. The MRI revealed she has fibrosis – scarring – in her lungs. The potential long-term effects are sobering, as the lungs feed the other organs with oxygen. Like so many of us, she has yet to understand the impact on her future life. Those with sympathetic GPs like mine may fare better, but this virus has baffled scientific experts at every turn and it’s the same with recovery. Forget the predicted second wave of Covid-19 – we long-haulers are the second wave. And we need reassurance and help now. It cannot be left to the charity and voluntary sectors to drive research and support, as has happened with those with chronic fatigue. So the NHS programme is a good start, but the government must also pledge help and recognition of the havoc wreaked by post-Covid syndrome. Above all, it must ensure the new narratives that are emerging from the long-haul frontline are disseminated widely, particularly to the young, who have been endlessly told they are not at risk. Our stories show this to be palpably untrue – plenty of young long-haulers who were physically fit before a mild attack of the virus are now partially disabled. Our post-Covid narrative may not have an end, but as we attempt to resume normal life, grieve our dead and lick our wounds, it should act as a cautionary tale to those healthy people who believe the worst is over. For others, it may just be beginning. • Jemma Kennedy is a novelist, playwright and screenwriter",2020-07-26 06:30:16+00:00,105227,107

Not surprisingly, the UK government’s handling of the crisis has been heavily criticised, mostly for its tardiness and incompetence. Britain was too late in going into lockdown and it abandoned its ability to test for the coronavirus when it should have been ramping up capacity. The prime minister has blustered and vacillated over key policies from the wearing of masks to the timing of the easing of lockdown restrictions. Given this sad background, it has been startling to note recent headlines and comments made across the world about the country’s Covid-19 response. “The Brits are on course to save the world,” claimed the US economist Tyler Cowen in Bloomberg Opinion, while the American journal Science was at pains to quote leading international scientists who have heaped praise on our researchers’ anti-Covid work. “UK megatrial outshines other drug studies,” ran one of its headlines. The focus of all this attention is the Recovery trial programme set up by Oxford University scientists Martin Landray and Peter Horby. It has taken advantage of the vast numbers of stricken Covid-19 patients who have flooded Britain’s hospital wards in order to carry out careful, randomised trials that have revealed the efficacy of treatments provided by doctors. Thanks to this work, a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone has been shown to reduce deaths by a third in seriously stricken patients and is now used across the world as standard care for seriously ill patients. At the same time, the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, heavily promoted by Donald Trump and others, was revealed to have no effect as a treatment of Covid-19. It has now been dropped from clinical use for Covid-19 patients. These successes contrast with the failures of other countries, in particular the US, to assess carefully what treatments will actually improve the health – or save the lives – of patients. Landray and Horby deserve considerable credit for their pioneering efforts. Their Recovery trial programme was set up in only a few days as hospitals prepared themselves for the waves of seriously sick patients that would soon swamp their wards. Normally, it takes months to organise a large randomised drug trial. But, as both scientists have acknowledged, there have been many other individuals and organisations who deserve acclaim for their involvement in Recovery. For a start, there are the 3,000 doctors and nurses, often sleep-deprived, stressed and anxious, who helped collect precious data in the grim setting of their hospital’s intensive care units while also struggling to save patients’ lives. Around 12,000 individuals with serious Covid-19 infections were recruited to Recovery; many of them have died. Their involvement underlines the tragic impact of Covid-19 and the importance of Recovery in pinpointing drugs that should help to reduce future loss of life. Britain had one other advantage, of course. It possesses the centralised National Health Service. Many other nations have health services that are fragmented and so cannot launch sufficiently large-scale trials. By contrast, Britain was able to combine data from hospitals that have ranged from the Western Isles to Truro and from Derry to King’s Lynn and so tease out data that will continue to pinpoint life-saving treatments while highlighting those that are worthless. In addition, the National Institute for Health Research, created in 2006 and which provided Landray and Horby with their programme’s £2m funding, has played a critically important role in this affair. If nothing else, Recovery has demonstrated starkly the importance of possessing a strong, well-funded, national programme for treating patients and for assessing their needs on a sound scientific basis.",2020-07-26 05:15:15+00:00,105255,2
105320,commentisfree/2020/jul/25/the-uk-app-failure-sums-up-our-fatally-flawed-coronavirus-response,Opinion,The UK's app failure sums up our fatally flawed coronavirus response | John Naughton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/25/the-uk-app-failure-sums-up-our-fatally-flawed-coronavirus-response,"I’ve just been looking at the coronavirus death toll in various countries as tallied on the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker. At the time I checked, the UK had 45,407 deaths, Poland had 1,642, Ireland had 1,753, and Greece had – wait for it – 197. “Ah, yes,” you say, “but of course the UK has a much bigger population than most of those countries – 67.9 million compared to (respectively) 37.8 million, 4.9 million and 10.4 million.” So, as a simple mathematical exercise over breakfast, why not work out the number of deaths per 100,000 for each country? And then try not to choke on your muesli, for these numbers tell an unambiguous story. It is that by the standards of a number of other comparable democratic states, the UK government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis has been an unmitigated fiasco, second only, among developed countries, to the unfolding catastrophe in the United States. Some day, we will have a reckoning for how the Johnson administration screwed up so comprehensively. But that will have to wait, because it is still screwing up. The current focus of interest is why it took it so long to realise that the only way to deal with the threat was lockdown, contact tracing and quarantining, a methodology familiar to Europeans since at least the time of the Black Death. And when the history of this time comes to be written, one interesting case study in official ineptitude will focus on the British search for its very own “world-beating” smartphone contact-tracing app. The best interim report we have on this quest has been compiled by Rowland Manthorpe of Sky News. Since the Johnson crowd are fond of metaphors from the second world war, one Whitehall source who spoke to Manthorpe provided an illuminating one. Spool back to early April when the government was in complete disarray. The prime minister was in intensive care, possibly close to death. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, had himself contracted the virus. The government was, Manthorpe’s source recalls, “desperate for good news” and the idea of a smartphone app seemed to be just that. “Thousands of people were dying every day. It was a lot like 1940, the first few months… like the Norway campaign. Go off and do something that’ll be a big success – and it turns out to be a debacle.”
So it’s easy to see why the idea of an app appealed to Hancock and co. And, in principle, mobile phone technology can do some of the things contact tracing requires. The devices always know where they are, Bluetooth networking enables phones to detect other phones in the vicinity and so on. That was in theory. In practice, legions of devils lurked in the technical detail: Bluetooth’s flakiness, battery life problems and so on, plus privacy concerns and lack of public trust in the technology. And just as the UK team was getting going, Apple and Google, which control the two dominant smartphone operating systems, iOS and Android, got together and came up with a pair of APIs (application programming interfaces) that would enable contact tracing, but would keep all the data on the phones, rather than uploading it to centralised databases. Apps that violated that principle would not be allowed. At this point, governments had a choice to make: go it alone or accept the companies’ terms. It wasn’t an easy choice, because each approach had strengths and weaknesses. The Apple and Google one was better for privacy, but less informative from an epidemiological perspective. The app that NHSX, the health service’s technological arm, began developing was the other way round. It came down, Manthorpe says, to priorities. “Apple and Google’s app would detect everyone, but it wouldn’t detect the most risky people very well. With the NHSX app, the reverse was true.” The government seem to have decided to partly stick with the NHSX app, hoping, as one official put it, that Google and Apple will integrate NHSX’s work on Bluetooth into their framework. But the official had to admit they didn’t know if this would happen or even the timeline for a decision. So, concludes Manthorpe, “it is still unclear whether England will ever have a contact-tracing app”. Meanwhile, the Irish government, like many of its European counterparts, decided to go with the Apple and Google system. Since it launched on 6 July, the Covid Tracker app has been downloaded 1.3m times in eight days– the fastest downloaded app per capita in Europe – and has started picking up cases of infection. It was created by an Irish software company, NearForm, which has made a similar app for Gibraltar, launched last month, and another for Northern Ireland, which is due to be launched within weeks. And just for the avoidance of doubt, Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom, which makes one wonder it it will also be getting the NHSX app, if it ever sees the light of day.

Some serious early outbreaks of Covid-19 were associated with choirs and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has taken a precautionary approach. Concerns have also been raised about possible risks posed by the airflow from wind instruments. The current advice for England – other UK governments have yet to issue specific guidelines – is that while professional musicians can get back to work observing strict regulations, singers and woodwind and brass sections must be subject to particular precautions, such as distancing of 3 metres. For amateurs in England, though, singing or playing wind instruments in a group is forbidden. A vibrant culture of amateur choral societies and wind quintets, gospel choirs and brass bands has been silenced, with no indication of when they can get going again. While the precautions are sensible, facts are thin on the ground. In the case of the outbreaks that caused the anxieties about group singing, it has not been proven how transmission occurred. Was it because of physical proximity – sharing snacks in the tea breaks and hugs – or because of some property of singing itself? It is known that Covid-19 can be spread by droplets produced by talking, singing, coughing and other vocalisations. Some of these droplets are relatively large, and fall to the ground at a distance of 1-2 metres. Some, however, are much smaller. These aerosol particles remain in the air until blown away. There is still scholarly debate about the precise role that these latter particles play, but opinion is tending towards the view that the virus may indeed be transmitted by them. The practical question is whether singing and the playing of woodwind and brass instruments produce more of these droplets and aerosol particles than speaking, decibel for decibel. If they do not, then it would be illogical to attach specific regulations to these musical activities. If volume is confirmed as the major determinant of the number of droplets produced, as a 2019 study on speaking suggested, there could also be interesting consequences for any group activities involving raising one’s voice indoors – for example, cheering at a televised football match inside a pub. Better information is needed. Fortunately, research is being undertaken by scientists from Bristol University and Imperial College London. Experiments have taken place on professional and amateur singers, and woodwind and brass players, comparing the number of droplets and aerosol particles generated by these activities with speaking. The study is peer-reviewed and publication is expected within weeks. The livelihoods of professionals, the wellbeing of amateurs and the pleasure of audiences depend on it. It will be a wonderful moment when England, and the other nations of the UK, can start singing again. But it has to be done safely.",2020-07-24 17:25:32+00:00,105450,2
105742,commentisfree/2020/jul/23/bias-science-bse-coronavirus-crisis,Opinion,Bias in ‘the science’ on coronavirus? Britain has been here before | Sonia Sodha,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/23/bias-science-bse-coronavirus-crisis,"It became the defining moment of the BSE crisis. In an attempt to persuade the public that it was perfectly safe to eat beef, the then agriculture minister, John Gummer, fed his four-year-old daughter a burger on camera in 1990. Six years later, the government admitted there was a link between eating infected beef and the brain disease vCJD, though thankfully the numbers affected were relatively small. Nevertheless, the scandal eroded public trust in government public health messaging, with knock-on effects on parents’ perception of government advice during the MMR scandal, a few years later. The Gummer moment should serve as a warning to politicians about what happens if they seek to patronise the public with assurances that are not backed up by science. Yet there are already several candidates for the coronavirus equivalent. Will it be Boris Johnson boasting of “shaking hands with everybody” on 3 March? His claim on 12 March that banning large events would have little effect? Or his assurances that the government will avoid another national lockdown? The public inquiry into the BSE scandal resulted in a 16-volume report that called for greater transparency in the production and use of scientific advice, and for the public to be treated like grownups who can understand uncertainty. Twenty years later, those lessons appear to have been forgotten. One of the questions already being asked is why the government took so long to implement a full lockdown. There were two narratives that emerged from the government’s science advisers in the early days: that it would be wrong to suppress the spread of Covid-19 altogether as this would prevent “herd immunity” building up, and that the public would only tolerate a lockdown for so long. In a programme for Radio 4 this week, I looked at where this pseudo-scientific idea of “behavioural fatigue” came from: none of the behavioural scientists I interviewed – including those who sit on Sage’s behavioural science subcommittee – knew. Similar questions remain about exactly how the idea of pursuing herd immunity emerged. One thing is clear. The government’s science advisers are repeating the mistakes of the BSE crisis – confusing a lack of evidence of risk or benefit for a lack of risk or benefit altogether. The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, asserted back in March that mask wearing was “not a good idea” for members of the public because it could increase the risk of contracting the virus. The developing evidence base on masks contradicts this. Others have made the same error: the World Health Organization has for months insisted that Covid-19 is transmitted through droplets when people cough or sneeze, rather than through much finer aerosols that can linger in the air for longer. But there was little certainty around this, and new evidence suggests that aerosol transmission may indeed be an issue. At the root of all this is the nature of scientific knowledge. It is rarely black and white, and this is never more true than with a new disease, what the science historian Lorraine Daston has dubbed an “empirical ground zero”. That ground zero entails a high degree of uncertainty, which paves the way for human bias. The paradox of science is that it is that while it aspires to peeling away bias to leave knowledge that is pure and true, it is practised by human beings who are as subject to biases as the rest of us. As understanding of the problem of bias in science has grown, there has been much soul-searching about how to reduce it by improving the way research gets reviewed and scrutinised. But there has been much less focus on how to eliminate bias from the production of scientific advice for government. A brilliant scientist will not necessarily be a brilliant scientific adviser. An adviser needs to be able to communicate findings outside their area of expertise, to juggle contradictory views, and to act as a conduit between academia and high politics. And there are structural incentives towards bias in scientific advice. Politicians suffer from confirmation bias – looking for evidence that supports their worldview. Boris Johnson – a self-professed libertarian aware of the economic risks of Brexit – would hardly have been keen to shut down the economy; little wonder the flawed ideas of behavioural fatigue and herd immunity got traction. Politicians also like certainty: despite Brexiteer scepticism about experts, this government has used the mantra that it is “following the science” as a shield for its political decision making. But scientific advisers can also be complicit. Peter Lunn, a behavioural scientist who advised the Irish government there was no evidence for behavioural fatigue, told me that in his experience, scientists tend to be more strident in communicating evidence if they know it will chime with what politicians want to hear. This is why there needs to be more transparency about the processes through which scientific advice feeds into decision making. The role of Sage versus the role of the chief scientific adviser, at present Patrick Vallance, is too fuzzily defined. Sage was set up as an ad hoc group with a rotating cast of scientists, yet is being held collectively accountable in a way that does not reflect this status. Its minutes are now being published, but do not adequately express dissenting opinion. We know too little about how the chief scientific adviser, who chairs Sage, funnels its range of opinions into government. It would create much clearer lines of accountability if Vallance’s advice, drawing on Sage input, was published as such. But the only way to get a sense of that advice in real time has been when he stands at a Downing Street podium, a troubling politicisation of the independent scientist’s role. This is even more troubling given reports that the chief nursing officer was dropped from press conference lineups after she refused to back Dominic Cummings over his breach of lockdown guidelines. The lack of clarity also fails to protect scientific advisers from accusations of bias. For instance, back in March, Vallance – who says his job is to speak scientific truth to power – was seen as a favourite for the role of chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, a £7bn -a-year science funding body, an appointment that Cummings, obsessed with science policy, would have likely had influence over. This would be a tricky position for anyone to negotiate, regardless of their integrity, and greater transparency would have insulated Vallance from the accusation that it might have affected his ability to deliver difficult messages. Certainty comes across as authoritative, even when it is anything but. It is not just the government’s advisers who fall prey to this; some of its strongest scientific critics have also downplayed uncertainty. There are those who are keen to pin 100% of the blame on the politicians, and those who would rather it was all laid at the door of their scientific advisers. But I suspect any inquiry will produce lessons eerily similar to those of the BSE report. Back then, the absence of systems to protect scientific advice from bias were partly to blame. It seems not much has changed. • Sonia Sodha is a Guardian columnist",2020-07-23 11:33:10+00:00,105743,2
105773,commentisfree/2020/jul/23/world-needs-coronavirus-vaccine-big-pharma-monopoly-astrazeneca-patent-pandemic,Opinion,"The world needs a 'people's vaccine' for coronavirus, not a big-pharma monopoly | Helen Clark and Winnie Byanyima",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/23/world-needs-coronavirus-vaccine-big-pharma-monopoly-astrazeneca-patent-pandemic,"To bring an end to the pandemic, the world needs a vaccine. Promising early trial results for the vaccine developed by Oxford University suggest we’re inching closer to discovering one.
Data published recently in the Lancet shows the Oxford vaccine produced antibodies and T-cells in roughly 1,000 patients. The pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, has been licensed to produce this vaccine by early 2021, which includes an agreement to produce 1 billion doses with the Serum Institute in India for low- and middle-income countries by the end of that year. But this is still a long way from what is needed. To vaccinate everyone, the world needs as many as 7.8bn doses, as quickly as possible. If the successful vaccine requires more than one dose, or must be given annually, as seems likely, the figure will be higher still. The world will need a near-permanent supply of the vaccine. Only then can we bring Covid-19 under control. Once a safe and effective vaccine is discovered, the only barrier to providing sufficient doses should be the world’s manufacturing capacity. But other artificial barriers stand in the way. The intellectual property laws that grant pharmaceutical companies the exclusive rights to produce a particular medicine for a certain number of years are intended to reward investment and innovation into new medicines. These intellectual property rights are often abused and create monopolies, and in the case of the Covid-19 vaccine they threaten to limit the supply, causing deadly shortages and unnecessary delays. Granting one company exclusive rights to the science, knowhow and intellectual property of a coronavirus vaccine will prevent us from getting the billions of doses that the world needs. No private company, however committed it might be to delivering a vaccine, should have a monopoly over this public resource. A global pandemic is not the time to artificially ration the supply of a medicine because of failed ideas about the sanctity of intellectual property. Nor should the market be protected simply to serve the interests of pharmaceutical corporations. It’s also important to remember that AstraZeneca didn’t discover this vaccine. Billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money have been poured into the development and production of a Covid-19 vaccine. AstraZeneca has received $1.2bn from the United States government alone, and at least £84m from the UK government. Nor is the company bearing the risks of this innovation alone: governments are already committing to purchase the vaccine in advance of its production. In the rush to solve the global challenge of finding a Covid-19 vaccine, the leaders of rich countries appear to be relying on the goodwill of companies and a charitable approach towards poor nations and ignoring the barriers that intellectual property and other monopolies present. They seem to be assuming that the only option available is a private, market-based approach directed and controlled by pharmaceutical corporations. As the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, and prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, made clear recently when they joined 140 other public figures in calling for a “people’s vaccine”, this would be a grave mistake. Current distribution plans for the Oxford vaccine are an alarming reminder of what happens when you leave a public resource in the hands of a single company. Around 300m doses have been promised for developing countries by the end of this year – a welcome step, but one that pales in comparison with the 400m doses that will go to the US and UK. The Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany have secured another 400m doses between them. The EU and other rich nations are also pushing their way to the front of the queue. Many middle-income countries, such as those in Latin America, where the scale of the outbreak is frightening, may be completely locked out of these arrangements. When the American virologist Jonas Salk was asked who owned the patent to the polio vaccine he invented, he famously replied: “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” Oxford University should heed his remark and show leadership by contributing its knowledge and intellectual property to the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, where technology and treatments are shared for the benefit of all. Likewise, governments and charitable foundations that are funding promising vaccine candidates should insist the intellectual property and knowhow of the products they fund is shared in the WHO pool. The WHO’s attempt to organise a global system where treatments are allocated equitably is also vital. Its efforts should be supported by a framework that places equitable allocation at the heart of all decision-making – including the moment when companies first sign funding agreements with governments and health agencies. But if the WHO is to be successful in the face of vaccine nationalism, we must also do absolutely everything we can to maximise supply. Aside from insisting on the sharing of knowledge and intellectual property, rich countries should be urgently financing the rapid expansion of safe manufacturing capacity in developing countries. This extraordinary moment calls for a better approach than our current regime of monopoly rights. Only then will we be able to discover and produce, as quickly as possible, a people’s vaccine. • Helen Clark is a former prime minister of New Zealand and member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy • Winnie Byanyima is executive director of UNAids and UN undersecretary general",2020-07-23 09:00:38+00:00,105774,2
105970,commentisfree/2020/aug/31/politicians-covid-19-statistics-statisticians,Opinion,"When politicians cite Covid-19 statistics, they may be wrong – it doesn't mean the numbers are | David Spiegelhalter",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/politicians-covid-19-statistics-statisticians,"“Sooner or later we are going to have to have an inquiry into the role of statisticians in the Covid-19 crisis,” declared the journalist Ross Clark in the Daily Telegraph recently. “They will have to be put in the hot seat and grilled as to whether they contributed to the sense of panic which has gripped so many people and disrupted normal life for so long.” As one of those beastly statisticians, I would relish the opportunity. In my book The Art of Statistics, published last year, I quote the statistician and writer Nate Silver, who said: “Numbers have no way of speaking for themselves… we imbue them with meaning.” During this crisis, a lot of meaning has been imbued by people who want the numbers to support their argument. This may include making comparisons with Sweden to say a strict lockdown is unnecessary, or pointing to rising infection rates to demand a zero-Covid strategy. In contrast, statisticians tend to be pedantically cautious in their interpretation of data, as they understand its frailties and uncertainties, and are very reluctant to use it to argue that something should or should not be done. Statisticians also shouldn’t be blamed for the government’s unmourned daily press briefings during the first months of the pandemic lockdown. These revealed how politicians love to throw around lots of big numbers, showing pretty graphs, all led by the No 10 communications team. Back in May I called this “number theatre”. The frailty of some of these numbers is now being revealed: the accumulating Covid-19 death count in England dropped in mid-August by about 5,000, as the overall figure now doesn’t include anyone who died more than 28 days after a positive test. This decision was not apparently made by statisticians, and maybe more for unity of measurement between the four nations of the United Kingdom, than for its appropriateness. Numbers may not measure what you think they may be measuring, but they are rarely completely wrong. That’s why the statistical community let out a collective gasp last Sunday when Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told a press conference that treatment with convalescent plasma would mean that of “100 people who were sick with Covid-19, 35 would have been saved”. If true, this would be one of the most remarkable medical discoveries in history, saving one life for every three people treated. But it is completely false. In fact 8.9% of the treated group died, compared with 13.7% of a comparison group, a 35% relative difference. The absolute difference was 5%, so if we believed the figures, in fact 20 people had to be treated to save one life. But we should not even believe those numbers, being based on selected patients receiving the treatment, and not comparing like with like in a proper randomised design. This is possibly the most statistically dim-witted utterance I have witnessed from any authority during this crisis, and he’s up against some pretty stiff competition, not least from the president flanking him at the press conference. People tend to have an exaggerated sense of their vulnerability to Covid-19, and I admit that statisticians must take some responsibility for not communicating a realistic idea of the risks. Partly this is a problem with averages – just saying that around 1% of people die after catching the virus can be misleading when this average figure disguises a huge variability, estimated to range from around 20% in the very old and frail, to roughly one in 50,000 for schoolchildren. It is quite right to focus on the effects of ethnicity, deprivation and people-facing jobs, each of which can roughly double the risk of catching and dying from the virus. But being just six years older also doubles your risk: it goes up, like some lethal form of compound interest, at around 12% for each year of age. The spread of the virus at the start of the epidemic showed how difficult it was to grasp this idea of exponential increase, but it may help us understand why the current rise in cases is not being followed by extra hospital admissions or deaths. It is vital that we don’t just count cases, but look at their ages, and the latest report from Public Health England reveals the highest rate of positive tests is in the 15-44 age-group. If 5,000 30-year-olds get infected, we might expect just one or two to die, and so this helps explain the lack of severe consequences so far. But it’s a different picture for the frail and elderly, who need proper protection. This is a tricky time for us all, with a need to balance potential harms and benefits while faced with so much uncertainty. This is true both for society as a whole and for each individual weighing up their options. As a community, we require increasingly intensive coronavirus surveillance, and rapid and proportionate local action, combined with maximum efforts to open schools and get the economy moving, while also protecting the extremely vulnerable. And as individuals, we all have to face the fact that this is not going to go away in a hurry: even if a vaccine eventually arrives, it may not afford complete protection and may need repeating. So those who are currently shielding will at some point have to decide whether they want to be shut in their homes for the foreseeable future. This process will be gradual, and suitably cautious, but we have long since learned to manage risks such as transport accidents and terrorism. This transition to a world that is not “safe”, but hopefully low risk, will be driven by statistics. And overall, I think the statisticians have done a good job through the crisis. But I would say that, wouldn’t I? I must admit to a conflict of interest, being a non-executive director of the UK Statistics Authority, which oversees the national statistics and, fortunately, answers to parliament rather than a ministry. So bring on that hot seat and the grilling. • David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University.

106674,commentisfree/2020/aug/27/local-lockdowns-england-coronavirus-watchlist,Opinion,Local lockdowns based on arbitrary figures are punishing England's poorest | Carl Heneghan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/27/local-lockdowns-england-coronavirus-watchlist,"As a general practitioner, Julian Tudor Hart lived and worked in south Wales. He pioneered much of what now constitutes modern routine preventive care, seeking out those most in need. His research from the 1960s onwards in Welsh mining communities showed that medical care was often not available to those with greatest need: the most deprived in society. Today we are seeing a corollary to this with the imposition of restrictive Covid-19 lockdown measures that target the most deprived – those who can least afford to endure them. The government has now announced trial payments for some people on low incomes who must self-isolate, but more is required.
In the week ending 8 August, there were 110 positive cases of Sars-CoV-2 per 100,000 in the town of Oldham – breaking through the 50 cases threshold that puts it on the government’s “red alert” watchlist. Each week Public Health England (PHE) publishes a Covid-19 report that summarises information from the surveillance systems used to monitor the pandemic in England. Currently, 28 local authorities are on the at-risk watchlist following the weekly Local Action Committee meeting. In 18 of them, households are not allowed to mix. While weekly rates in Oldham have come down, they are still among the highest. The current watchlist is dominated by areas of deprivation: Bradford (ranked the 13th most deprived local authority in England), Blackburn with Darwen, Hyndburn, Oldham and Leicester are at the top of the watchlist. They are all in the top 10% of the most deprived areas in England.
The higher number of detected cases in these deprived areas is highly predictable. A built environment provides numerous opportunities for transmission of infection: high population density and overcrowded housing present the ideal conditions. In England, about 3% of the population live in overcrowded accommodation; this is much more prevalent among lower-income households. And while 2% of white households experienced overcrowding from 2014 to 2017, that number is much higher in ethnic minorities – it shoots up to 30% in Bangladeshi households. Oldham town has a greater proportion of minority-ethnic residents than Greater Manchester or England: one in 10 of the population is of Pakistani heritage, one in 14 of Bangladeshi heritage. These communities primarily live in the most deprived areas and have already been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The death rate among people of Bangladeshi heritage is twice that of white people even when accounting for age, sex, and levels of deprivation. The risk for other ethnic minorities is 10-50% higher than for white people. PHE’s review in June promised to discover why the infection had such an unequal effect on people of different ethnicity. However, the report has been widely criticised for mentioning nothing about what could be done to improve the situation or suggesting plans for protecting at-risk groups. Are the restrictive measures, therefore, justified? The current watchlist level is based on an arbitrary figure that does not represent how we have assessed epidemic levels of community infection in the past. An epidemic is said to occur when weekly GP consultations for new episodes of flu-like illness exceed 400 per 100,000. This figure, therefore, refers to a person who has symptoms and is presenting to healthcare. On the contrary, current PCR testing is being used as a screening tool: in affected areas, testing is on the increase due to hypervigilance and active case-finding strategies that include knocking on doors. This strategy frequently picks up asymptomatic people. The watchlist figure of 50 per 100,000, therefore, does not consider the impact of the disease. Only nine people are currently in hospital with Covid-19 across the Pennine Trust hospitals that cover Oldham, Rochdale (also on the watchlist) and North Manchester. Increased testing leads to more detection of the virus, but it has not necessarily translated into infections that cause symptomatic disease. Many of those who have tested positive would be classed as weak positives – their risk of transmitting the disease further is low. Politicians’ urge to intervene is a sign that the test-and-trace programme has failed. But restrictive interventions are often too quickly deployed. Nevertheless, there is a radical need to improve living conditions; improve access to health and social services; address the urban environmental exposures that contribute to infectious outbreaks; and rethink the social factors that cause high infection rates in deprived areas. Tudor Hart died in 2018. He is best known for his “inverse care law” that showed the availability of good medical care tends to correspond inversely with the need for it in the population served. The case for improving health outcomes in deprived populations is clear. But there is a pressing need for our politicians to think carefully before deciding what to do next and consider the wider needs of the people affected by such restrictive measures.

106712,commentisfree/2020/aug/27/covid-19-antibody-test-coronavirus-corners-being-cut,Opinion,Too many corners are being cut in the race to find a Covid-19 antibody test | Jon Deeks,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/27/covid-19-antibody-test-coronavirus-corners-being-cut,"During the pandemic, Covid-19 tests have provided a rich source of media coverage. Most of us now know a bit about how these tests work, and that they can generate errors that lead to wrong and harmful decisions. Tests have to be used on the right samples at the right time, else more errors can be made, and there are important differences between “have I got it?” viral swab tests, and “have I had it?” antibody blood tests. Despite this, the government keeps getting testing – particularly antibody tests – wrong. In March, the UK bought two million unproven finger-prick tests from China, which Boris Johnson described as having “the potential to be a total game-changer”. In April, an Oxford study reported that the tests were too inaccurate for public use. In May, a new laboratory antibody test manufactured by Roche was widely reported as “100% accurate” but Public Health England showed that the test failed to identify 16% of samples from people who had Covid-19. By then, the government had signed a contract to make the Roche test initially available to NHS and care workers. And in June, many public sales of laboratory antibody tests were stopped after the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found they were using finger-prick samples rather than the larger venous blood samples that were required. So why do the diagnostics industry, the media and government keep falling for these tests? First, there are the obvious reasons: politicians and journalists love headlines that boost morale and give the impression of activity and progress. Covid-19 tests are particularly prone to misleading coverage because the regulatory process for tests is weak, inadequate and largely based on self-declaration rather than scientific scrutiny. Tests can obtain official CE-IVD approval and go to market after only limited laboratory studies, which may be wrongly used to suggest the tests are accurate in clinical settings. And not all companies appear to have the knowledge, or the will, to undertake rigorous clinical evaluations. The latest news of a “game-changing” home antibody test arrived at the end of July. According to reports, “secret human trials” from the government-backed UK Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC) showed the test, manufactured by Abingdon Health, was “99.40% accurate”. The Oxford Regius professor of medicine, Sir John Bell, (who was involved in creating the consortium) described the test as “truly amazing”, and the government promised to purchase millions to send to the UK public free of charge. For the first time, a Covid-19 antibody test appeared to have met the MHRA target of less than 2% false negatives and false positives. With this new test, will the run of monthly “game-changing” stories about antibody tests come to an end? It seems unlikely. Despite optimistic coverage, the results from the Abingdon test seem too good to be true. When it comes to evaluating Covid-19 antibody tests, a golden rule has been broken. Tests must be evaluated in individuals who represent the people who will use them in the future. For a “have I had it?” test, this means people known to have had or not had Covid-19. People infected with the virus don’t all have the same antibody responses: some have high responses, others low responses and some have no response at all. A performance study will only give the right answer when it evaluates a test in a group of individuals with this diverse mixture of responses. In the case of the Abingdon test, this doesn’t appear to have happened. The manufacturer’s website gives little information about the “secret studies” by the UK-RTC. To evaluate the test’s ability to detect Covid-19, an unstated number of people were recruited who had symptoms or a positive swab test for Covid-19. Crucially, they were then tested with a different laboratory antibody test, the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG), and anyone who didn’t show antibodies on that test was excluded, leaving 203 people. These exclusions are precisely the problem: the sample of 203 people doesn’t represent the diversity of people who will use the Abingdon test in the real world, but a sample who have already tested positive on a different antibody test. In other words, this study of the Abingdon test looks as if it was biased from the start towards people with high antibody levels, which are easier to detect. This is because the EUROIMMUN test misses many Covid-19 cases – particularly among people with no or low antibody responses; indeed, PHE estimates it misses 28%. Working on the basis of this 28% figure, this would mean that around 79 true Covid-19 cases could have been excluded in the evaluation of the Abingdon test. These excluded people are more likely to be missed by other tests, including the Abingdon test, because all tests are more likely to fail when people have no or low antibodies. And it’s the people who are most likely to want an antibody test – those who stayed at home with mild infections – whose low antibody levels are most likely to be missed. It’s impossible to know from this data whether UK-RTC has discovered a game-changing test. Further evaluations of the Abingdon test are apparently ongoing, but no details are available so we have no way of scrutinising them. Such secrecy destroys trust. Restoring scientific credibility will require urgent publication of the protocols and reports for these studies. And if we’ve learned anything from this pantomime, it’s that the current regulations aren’t fit for purpose: they disregard the importance of robust evidence about clinical accuracy and fail to protect the public from the harm that can be caused by poor, inadequately evaluated tests. •Jon Deeks is Professor of Biostatistics and leads the Biostatistics, Evidence Synthesis and Test Evaluation Research Group in the Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham",2020-08-27 13:00:53+00:00,106713,2
106992,commentisfree/2020/aug/26/we-mustnt-understate-the-importance-of-anyones-life-when-it-comes-to-covid-deaths,Opinion,We mustn't understate the importance of anyone's life when it comes to Covid deaths | Matt Beard,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/26/we-mustnt-understate-the-importance-of-anyones-life-when-it-comes-to-covid-deaths,"In recent editorials on Sky News and in News Corp newspapers, a new distinction entered Australia’s Covid-19 discourse: between dying “with” the virus and dying “from” the virus. While relatively new in Australia, this talking point is months old. It first surfaced in the US, championed by a range of rightwing commentators. US virus researcher Anthony Fauci dismissed the suggestion the US death toll had been overstated in this way as a “conspiracy theory”. On the level of principle, asking whether these people were already so unwell that they would have died anyway, whether or not they had Covid-19, is a reasonable consideration. Of course we should be precise and accurate in capturing the risk and harm of Covid-19. If someone is killed in a car accident, whether they had the virus or not is irrelevant. Their death shouldn’t be added to the Covid-19 deaths.
These kinds of deaths aren’t being counted in Australia. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia’s guidelines define a Covid-19 death as “a death in a probable or confirmed Covid-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to Covid-19 (eg trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from Covid-19 between illness and death”. This is the sense in which a distinction between dying “with” and dying “from” Covid-19 is reasonable. It’s the way in which Victorian premier Daniel Andrews used it when discussing Australia’s youngest Covid-19 related death. He said: “We are talking about the youngest person that has died of this virus, or at least with this virus,” leaving open for the coroner the option of exploring other possible causes of death. However, this isn’t the way that rightwing agitators want to use the distinction. They’re concerned with cases where a death can be related to Covid-19 but can’t solely be attributed to it because of other health factors in play. For them, the only way you can die from Covid-19 is if it’s the only thing that can plausibly be said to kill you. This is an unusual claim. We don’t think that way about any other event. When we describe the deaths that emerged from the second world war, we include those who died from starvation who would have otherwise survived. When we measure alcohol related deaths, we include those who died from drink-driving. Similarly, we should consider that people whose existing conditions were exacerbated by Covid-19 to the point where they died, to have died from the virus. And yet, despite the ease with which we can dismiss the argument, there’s something more revealing at play here. The grammatical distinction of dying with v dying from hides a much more serious distinction that informs what’s going on here. Namely, a distinction between deaths that matter and deaths that don’t.
In my view, the reason those who advocate in favour of the from/with distinction are doing so is because they want people to see that those who merely died of Covid-19 are irrelevant to any analysis of the costs and benefits of a lockdown. For them, if Covid-19 only killed you because you were already pretty unwell, then you were probably going to die soon anyway. Sad, yes. But not as sad as if someone “healthy” were to die. Moving on from the from/with distinction, in May, UNSW economist Gigi Forster, one of the loudest opponents to coronavirus restrictions, argued that our weighing of lives lost to Covid-19 is misleading because it doesn’t account for age. Those who have died are “predominantly the lives of older people with a few years, not an entire life, left to live”. It is correct that standard economic approaches would factor in age, as well as other factors such as disability and health conditions. They wouldn’t count lives, they would count “quality-adjusted life years”. From this health economics standpoint, once you’re of a certain age, or below a certain health threshold, your years of life simply matter less than those of healthier, younger people. According to this approach, while all lives are worth living, not all lives are equally worth saving. However, the fact this is a well-established practice does not make it a good one. Like any algorithm, it carries the appearance of objectivity while being laden with subjective, biased and ideological claims. Limiting our counting of Covid-19 mortalities to those who were previously in the peak of health is to court a widespread, deep and ruinous belief. Namely, that at some point on the spectrum of age and health, your status changes from “living” to “waiting to die”. And if you were already on the waitlist, is it so bad if you get there a bit faster?
This kind of thinking is cruelly unimaginative. It’s easy to assume – especially if you’re scoring a perfect 1.0 on the quality of life scale – that if someone is unable to enjoy all the things that give you a sense of vitality, then as alive as they might be, they’re not really living anymore. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that, “To live is not to breathe but to act. It is to make use of our organs, our senses, our faculties, of all the parts of ourselves which give us the sentiment of our existence. The man who has lived the most is not he who has counted the most years but he who has most felt life.” It would be easy to take Rousseau to be glorifying youthful vitality and the robustness of life. However, that too would be unimaginative. Instead, we should read him as inviting us to think of a “full life” as one in which we acknowledge, appreciate and experience the full range of the human condition. Instead of using accounting techniques to explain what’s wrong with ageing and illness, we could use the lived experience of those who are ill and aged to learn what’s wrong with us. Rousseau’s passage ends by saying, “men have been buried at one hundred who have died at their birth”. It’s worth considering what it would take to be considered dead in this way. I can’t speak for Rousseau, but I reckon one candidate is the person who is willing to understate the importance of someone else’s life as a way of protecting their own. • Matt Beard is an Australian moral philosopher, fellow at the Ethics Centre and a regular writer on philosophy and ethics",2020-08-26 06:33:14+00:00,106993,2
107188,commentisfree/2020/aug/25/england-second-wave-coronavirus-winter-surge,Opinion,Has England learned any lessons from the first wave of coronavirus? | Philip Ball,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/25/england-second-wave-coronavirus-winter-surge,"No one knows what the next months hold, but suggestions that Britain will be back to normal by Christmas seem unlikely. Already, Leicester, Greater Manchester and Preston have enforced local lockdowns after registering rises in Covid-19 cases, while increases in Spain and Germany are an alarming reminder of the difficulty of controlling this virus. Cold weather could potentially boost the spread of coronavirus and make social distancing outdoors more difficult. The dangers are clear – so is England ready? “We’ve got to up our game for the autumn,” says Ewan Birney, deputy director of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. “We’ll be inside more. Universities and schools will be running. There will be a whole bunch of contacts we don’t have now.” England has made significant progress over the summer on some of the problems that made the first wave of coronavirus so disastrous. But this still may not be enough, and outcomes depend on factors that are hard to predict. “We can anticipate a lot more infections over the next few months,” says virologist Jonathan Ball of the University of Nottingham. The government has pledged £3bn of extra funding for the NHS, but more support and preparation may be needed urgently to cope with the challenges of this winter. The nightmare scenario for the NHS, according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, is a combination of events all arriving at once. A second surge of Covid-19, combined with a difficult outbreak of flu and the usual pressures that winter puts on health services, could occur at the same time that the NHS is trying to restart services that were suspended during the crisis – all faced by an exhausted staff. “We struggle with winter pressures at the best of times, with insufficient bed and community care capacity to deal with levels of demand,” Hopson says. It’s not all gloom, though. The situation with personal protective equipment has improved, as has the availability of ventilators. What matters most, however, is the capacity for testing. England’s response was crippled by its lack of testing capacity during the first wave, when scientists and public health authorities were flying blind, not knowing how widespread the virus was or where it was concentrated, and care homes were left fatally exposed.
It’s different now. The UK is conducting tests as widely and as fast as most European countries: around 200,000 each day. Most of these are analysed in the Lighthouse labs established for the purpose but repurposed academic labs are also helping. “We’re in a much better position than we were at the start of the pandemic,” says molecular geneticist Andrew Beggs, who leads testing efforts at the University of Birmingham. “The government has massively increased capacity in a short space of time, and I’m more confident than I was two months ago.” What’s needed, says Ball, is “sentinel surveillance”, focused testing to actively discover levels of infection, particularly in high-risk locations such as hospitals and care homes, as well as schools and universities. The Office for National Statistics is heading a pilot survey to test a representative sample of households in the general population – up to 150,000 people a fortnight by October – to gauge the extent of infection. Such monitoring can alert public health services and epidemiologists to hotspots, so that they can be contained locally. This lets hospital staff know which patients can be safely kept on general wards, and whether they themselves are safe to be at work. Regular testing will be essential for frontline workers such as public transport staff. Tests are nearly always returned now within 48 hours (much longer and they are of little value), and often within a day. New tests developed by British companies such as Oxford Nanopore and DNANudge could hypothetically reduce the waiting time to a few hours or less – allowing for tests to be portable and conducted on site, in places such as airport check-ins, commercial centres and factories. These options are still a long way off – and they depend on whether the promising initial results from the new methods stand up, as well as the companies’ unproven ability to scale up production. But “even if one technology doesn’t work out for rapid onsite screening, we have others in the pipeline”, says Beggs.
Both the number of tests and their speed still need to increase, though: Hopson thinks we’ll need about 1m tests a day by the end of December. “That’s a very tall order,” he says. And the system needs to be joined up: a test result must go at once into a patient’s health records so it can be accessed by local GPs. It’s vital too that positive results are followed up with good contact tracing, which is still the weak link in the government’s Covid response. The number of people being contacted is far lower in the UK than in other countries, such as Germany, and it’s not clear how much they are actually self-isolating. “There has been no data published on it and we know it’s not happening”, says Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London. People who are financially unable to self-isolate for 14 days need to be supported, with lost earnings covered by the government. And then there is the question of schools. While there’s general agreement that getting pupils back in must be a priority, this will inevitably cause the virus to spread. There’s evidence that secondary-school pupils can do that as much as adults, and primary-school children can do so even if they display only mild symptoms (probably about 15-20% of children infected have no symptoms at all). But there are encouraging signs that schools might not be as big spreaders as initially thought. Sweden left schools open and didn’t see lots of outbreaks or transmission, says Sanjay Patel, consultant in paediatric infectious diseases at Southampton Children’s Hospital, and teachers had lower rates of infection than taxi drivers or supermarket workers. Patel predicts that schooling “will be hugely disrupted – there will be closures and outbreaks, and lots of children will be in and out of school”. Children who get the usual winter sniffles “will have to be excluded at once until they get a test result, and their parents will have to isolate for that period too”. There’s no zero-risk option, but “the best way of protecting against outbreaks in school is to minimise infection in the community”, Patel says. This means compensating for school openings with restrictions elsewhere. “Do we prioritise our ability to have a drink in the pub, or the future education of our children?” So are we ready? No – that would be nigh-on impossible even with a functioning and competent government. But we’re not as woefully vulnerable as we were in March. “We have some really good plans in place for this winter”, Patel adds. “We’ve learnt a lot from the first surge, and there’s absolutely no feeling of panic.” • Philip Ball is a science writer",2020-08-25 09:24:56+00:00,107189,2

The country is facing an overwhelming but under-reported Covid-19 crisis among a population already beaten down by almost a decade of conflict and economic turmoil. I and my colleagues feel helpless and expect the worst. Our nurses and doctors are suffering from a dangerous shortage of medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing. Hospitals in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and other cities across the country are overcrowded and lack the basic instruments to deal with a pandemic at such scale due to the long war, poor planning and mismanagement.
Over the past weeks, the numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths have rapidly increased and are far higher than the official figures of the Syrian government or the World Health Organization. The official numbers were only 1,593 cases and 60 deaths as of 16 August. None of us believe these figures to be accurate. The deputy director of health for Damascus estimated the real number of Covid cases to be 112,500 in the Damascus area alone. We have hundreds of unconfirmed coronavirus-related deaths every day. Aleppo hospitals are running out of body bags. Every day, the list of healthcare providers who have died from the virus gets longer. We are asked to purchase our own PPE. We are treating patients in dirty rooms without enough medication and with little equipment to protect ourselves. Our hospitals are working at over-capacity, with beds and ventilators already occupied. We have the heartbreaking job of turning patients away because there is nothing we can do to help them. As doctors, this is our worst nightmare. Healthcare providers are unable to speak out and voice our concerns. Government minders watch what we say and what we write on our social media. We are scared to share information about the disease spread and treatment with each other. We are scared of the pandemic and scared of the consequences of speaking out. Many patients with symptoms now prefer to stay at home than to seek medical care, and people are trying to buy their own oxygen and ventilators, or hope for the best without any care at all. We see patients lying in the streets crying for help. Only 300 tests are being performed a day in only five government-run centres. Like everything in Syria, those who have connections and enough money have easier access to testing than those who don’t. The early lockdown was reversed without clear reasons, which sent the wrong message to the public. Masks are expensive. People are not abiding by social distancing and masking. People are left with no choice but to open their businesses and go out to work, which is increasing the spread of the virus.
We have no choice but to appeal once again to the world’s conscience. I ask the government and the WHO office in Syria to be transparent: we need to figure out the the true extent of Covid infections in our country. Hiding the real number of cases and deaths will simply cause more loss of life. I appeal to the international community and UN agencies to take urgent measures to support our hospitals, local organisations and the healthcare system by providing more testing capacity, PCR machines, testing kits, medication, PPE, medical supplies, oxygen machines and ventilators. I understand that medical and humanitarian support is exempted from any international sanctions. I urge UN agencies and local health authorities to ensure that distributing life-saving medical supplies is based on a transparent process of needs, monitoring and evaluation without any delay or bottlenecks. Syria is on the brink of an unprecedented catastrophe. I ask those in power to listen before it is too late.",2020-08-24 08:00:19+00:00,107406,2

It captured some of the difficulty of balancing people’s needs and wishes with the urgency of containing the spread of coronavirus. It was also a reminder that regulations must not only reflect what is possible in health terms but what is graspable and acceptable – perhaps easier in a highly rule-bound society like Singapore’s. The outcome of a medical crisis depends to a large degree on social rules and our ability to follow them. Formulating them is a tricky business, and increasingly so as infections resurge in places that hoped they were past the worst. The R value for the UK may have risen above 1 for the first time since the weekly reporting of data began in May, scientists warned on Friday. The number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England rose 27% in a week, hitting its highest level since June. On Saturday, Scotland announced the biggest single-day jump in three months. As winter approaches, keeping infection rates down will only get tougher. But when lockdown started, everyone knew what they had to do. The simple message to stay at home has since been superseded by a mass of specific guidance, frequently changed and often very poorly communicated. Now, not only the four nations but also cities and even wards are under different obligations. The complexity is the necessary result of highly variable rates of infection in different places, as well as of political choices. But even the best intentioned are confused about what is and is not permitted. Others don’t seem to care. One issue is the lack of explicit discussion by politicians of the choices we are making. In Oldham, Blackburn and parts of Pendle, residents have been told not to socialise with anyone from outside their household, even in gardens or parks. Yet pubs and restaurants remain open. In Birmingham, where people have been asked to restrict visitors to their home, the council leader says that data shows outbreaks have occurred in workplaces and the hospitality sector too. We should not be surprised when people struggle to make sense of these rules. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, has been more candid about trade-offs. In some places, pubs and shops may have to close so that schools can reopen, he has warned. Parents and staff have sensible concerns about the return to school that must be addressed, especially given the lack of guidance over what will happen if there is an outbreak and the World Health Organization’s call for children over 12 to wear masks. But the prioritisation of education is right: the suspension of schooling has been damaging for children, especially the poorest, and has left many adults unable to work. What we should not accept is the crude idea of a choice between lives and livelihoods. As punitive as lockdown has been, top economists have warned that a premature easing could trigger a higher death toll and deeper recession. Three things are clear. First, the government’s rush to reopen squandered the opportunity to suppress infections more substantially and sent the wrong message to the public – caution must now be paramount. Second, we need better testing and tracing, which is critical to containing outbreaks; the performance of outsourcing companies is woefully inadequate. Finally, the public must be better consulted and informed about choices: it helps when people know not only what the rules are, but why. An information campaign should include, for example, efforts to reshape norms around masks – greater compliance should allow greater mixing. People have shown their willingness to comply with tough rules when it is necessary, but they will not follow those that they do not understand or believe in.",2020-08-23 17:30:02+00:00,107493,2

This government has proved its talent for popular revolt. Within a year, Boris Johnson has stormed Labour’s ”red wall”, wrested Brexit from a reluctant parliament, abolished the Department for International Development and Public Health England, and threatened the future of the BBC. But there is, as yet, no plan in evidence for completing the revolution. It is much harder to erect institutions than to tear them down. Consider Whitehall’s construction of an entirely new state architecture to manage coronavirus in the past six months, which even ministers admit has been a struggle. The recurring dysfunction of the national contact-tracing system, the failure of the NHS volunteering scheme, the lack of remote teaching for every child – these are all testament to the difficulty of building new systems from scratch. This is why Conservatives since Edmund Burke have favoured organic reform over jarring revolution. In ministers’ defence, the pandemic has made statecraft considerably harder, stretching the bandwidth and resources of government like never before. But the autumn carries considerably more risk than the summer. Schools, universities and workplaces are about to fill up in earnest, the jobs nightmare will crystallise when 6.8 million people come off furlough, and care homes and hospitals will shortly brace for seasonal flu. Britain urgently needs a functional contact-tracing system, an operational youth employment scheme, and a plan for social care – and these must be in place well before winter arrives.
Ministers should take the coronavirus outbreak as a signal to build for the longer term, too. As the economist and social reformer William Beveridge wrote in 1942, “A revolutionary moment in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.” The Spanish flu resulted in the first public housing in the US. London and Paris owe, respectively, their sewers and boulevards, to outbreaks of cholera. The last few months have thrown the pieces of society, economy and the state up in the air. A far-sighted government would take the opportunity to bring them down in a new and purposeful configuration that both reshapes the institutions of society and builds consensus for its values. Over the past decade, Conservative ministers established the Office for Budget Responsibility to entrench fiscal conservatism, created metro mayors to ingrain regional leadership, and founded free schools to seed autonomy in education. Like all powerful institutions, all these have endured and proved formative, shaping the ideas and organisations around them. More to the point, the government’s own agenda depends on institution building. The prime minister’s plans to “level up” opportunity stand little chance until Britain’s regions have institutions that can compete with London for capital and talent. The UK is the most regionally imbalanced country in the industrialised world precisely because our top down, space-blind, centralised governance has no tools to rebalance it. Every part of Britain needs a powerful mayor and access to regional economic institutions to attract investment and fund infrastructure.
The same is true of efforts to increase the popularity of vocational education, which will only happen when routes have the cultural and economic prestige afforded by a degree. In the wake of this week’s exam debacle, which will lead to greater numbers going to university than usual, there is a strong case for endowing a new generation of institutions to deliver high-level technical courses. Like previous epidemics, Covid-19 presents an opportunity to rebuild our institutions on a grand scale, redrawing the social contract and remoulding the state in a way that leaves us more resilient and dynamic. But to do that policymakers need to start being clear what they are for – not just what they are against. If they cannot, they will leave a vacuum in which political anger and social anxieties can only fester, and where problems will just accumulate at their door.

However, as yet, there is no plan in evidence for completing the revolution. Of course, it is much harder to erect institutions than to tear them down. Just consider Whitehall’s construction of an entirely new state architecture to manage coronavirus in the past six months, which even ministers admit has been a struggle. The recurring dysfunction of the national contact tracing system, the failure of the NHS volunteering regime, the lack of remote teaching for every child – these are all testament to the difficulty of building new systems from scratch. This is why Conservatives since Edmund Burke have favoured organic reform over jarring revolution. In ministers’ defence, the pandemic has made statecraft considerably harder, stretching the bandwidth and resources of government as never before. But the autumn carries considerably more risk than the summer. Schools, universities and workplaces are about to fill up in earnest, the jobs nightmare will crystallise when 6.8 million people come off furlough, while care homes and hospitals will shortly brace themselves for the flu. Britain urgently needs a functional contact-tracing regime, an operational youth employment scheme and a plan for social care – and these must be in place well before winter arrives. Ministers should take the virus as a signal to build for the longer term too. As William Beveridge wrote in 1942: “A revolutionary time in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.” Spanish flu resulted in the first public housing in America. London and Paris owe their sewers and boulevards, respectively, to outbreaks of cholera. The past few months have thrown the pieces of society, economy and the state up in the air. A far-sighted government would take the opportunity to bring them down in a new and purposeful configuration that both reshapes the institutions of society and builds consensus for its values.
Over the past decade, Conservative ministers established the Office for Budget Responsibility to entrench fiscal conservatism, they created metro mayors to ingrain regional leadership and founded free schools to seed autonomy in education. Like all powerful institutions, they have not only endured but proved formative, shaping the ideas and organisations around them. More to the point, the government’s own agenda depends on institution-building. The prime minister’s plans to “level up” opportunity stand little chance until Britain’s regions have institutions that can compete with London for capital and talent. The UK is the most regionally imbalanced country in the industrialised world precisely because our top-down, space-blind, centralised governance has no tools to rebalance it. Every part of Britain needs a powerful mayor and access to regional economic institutions to attract investment and fund infrastructure. The same is true of efforts to increase the popularity of vocational education, which will only happen when it has the cultural and economic prestige afforded by a degree. In the wake of the exam debacle, which will see greater numbers going to university than usual, there is a strong case for endowing a new generation of institutions to deliver high-level technical courses. Like previous epidemics, coronavirus presents an opportunity to rebuild our institutions on a grand scale, redrawing the social contract and remoulding the state in a way that leaves us more resilient and dynamic. But to do that policymakers need to start being clear about what they are for – not just what they are against. If they cannot, they will leave a vacuum into which political anger and social anxieties can only fester and where problems will just accumulate at their door. • Will Tanner is former deputy head of the Downing Street policy unit",2020-08-22 20:00:36+00:00,107647,67
107914,commentisfree/2020/sep/30/coronavirus-covid-19-evidence-closing-bars-10pm-save-lives,Opinion,Is there any evidence that closing bars at 10pm will stem the spread of coronavirus? | Robert West,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/30/coronavirus-covid-19-evidence-closing-bars-10pm-save-lives,"It seems that every aspect of Covid-19 will be contested. Students of the history of public health politics will be having a strong sense of deja vu: the field is littered with heated debates that in essence are about numbers.
As someone who has worked in the field of tobacco control for some 40 years, I have witnessed many such debates. First, there was the question of how risky smoking was; then the addictive nature of tobacco. There were questions over how much safer low-tar cigarettes were. Then, of course, there was the issue of the harmfulness of passive smoking. Most recently there was the claim that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than “normal” cigarettes. To my mind these tobacco control dramas have had one important thing in common: a failure of some of those involved to use numbers as a way to achieve clarity. Instead vague quantification shapes a narrative. And that is exactly what we are seeing in the evolving arguments about the coronavirus. A recent act in this pandemic drama centres on the policy of forcing bars and restaurants in England to close at 10pm. The prime minister claimed to have based this new rule on scientific evidence that much of the spread of the virus is taking place in bars late in the evening. He says that this is at least in part due to people having consumed quite a bit of alcohol by this time and so being less likely to respect social distancing rules. This raises an important question. Does the government have a concrete estimate of the likely number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths averted by closing bars at 10pm? If so, what is the margin of error and what is the science on which it is based? Speaking personally I cannot recall the behavioural science subgroup of Sage – of which I am a participant – ever being asked about this. On a matter of such importance I would have expected advice to be sought, because the policy depends very largely on how people behave. If behavioural scientists had been asked to provide input into an estimate of the impact of the 10pm bar closures, one source of available evidence would be the extent to which allowing bars to remain open later at night in England and Wales back in 2005 made any difference to alcohol consumption or binge drinking. This would provide at least some evidence as to what might happen if one were to now restrict licensing hours. The answer appears to be that the impact was minimal. This may be for reasons that are not particularly informative in the current scenario. But it points to the possibility that restricting licensing hours would have a limited impact on how people behave later into the night. Other evidence suggests a more worrying conclusion: it seems that during the pandemic there has already been an increase in the proportion of alcohol that is consumed not in licensed premises. This might lead to concern that closing bars at 10pm would not reduce risky social contacts but might increase it, as people take their drinking to other locations. These impacts are quantifiable, albeit imprecisely. For example, I would judge the effect of the 10pm curfew on the infection rate to range between a reduction of around 10% and an increase of around 10%. Others might disagree, but we could then discuss this in concrete terms. Without being forced to state the range, we cannot get a handle on where any points of disagreement might lie in a scientific sense, and so the arguments can easily descend into polemics. The impact on the infection rate is just one number we are interested in when it comes to what to do about high-risk venues such as bars and restaurants. Another important number to estimate is the potential loss of income for venues in forcing them to close earlier. With so much at stake, I would expect a responsible government to seek advice on the likely range of values for this number, and for it to be thoroughly examined. Unless policymakers engage with numbers as concrete statements of what can be expected, there is no basis for rational decision making; and discussion about whether a policy is right or wrong is, in the language of the Scottish play, little more than strutting and fretting, “signifying nothing”. Perhaps the government is putting numbers into its ever-changing patchwork of policies, and perhaps it is comparing best-case and worst-case scenarios. Maybe it is consulting widely among experts and stakeholders who can help inform its estimates. I would put the likelihood of that to be somewhere between 1% and 5%. • Robert West is emeritus professor of health psychology at University College London and a participant in the behavioural science subgroup of Sage (SPI-B)",2020-09-30 13:21:40+00:00,107915,2
108138,commentisfree/2020/sep/29/rapid-low-cost-covid-test-world,Opinion,A new test from the WHO could be a game changer in the fight against Covid | Charlotte Summers,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/rapid-low-cost-covid-test-world,"The principles of managing infectious disease outbreaks, whether of measles, tuberculosis or Covid-19, are similar. You identify who has been infected by testing for the disease, discover where they acquired the infection and who may have also been infected through contact tracing, and stop the spread by asking those affected to isolate. People who become infected are treated with therapies that modify the course of the disease. It sounds simple, doesn’t it? Now think how you might implement this strategy on a global scale, for a disease no one knew existed 12 months ago. This is where organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), which provides leadership, expertise and coordination, come in. Since early 2020, the WHO has been working with different groups to support the development of testing, tracing and isolation programmes for coronavirus. Rightly, it has advocated that everyone should have access to these things, no matter where in the world they live. The problem is that testing for Covid-19 is expensive, and the laboratories required to process tests aren’t available in lots of countries. Covid tests are most often done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests, which require clinical samples, often obtained by trained healthcare workers, to be delivered to well-resourced laboratories staffed by highly skilled healthcare workers. In this context, the WHO’s recent announcement that a new type of Covid test will be rolled out across the world could be groundbreaking. Two new rapid diagnostic versions, one manufactured in the US, the other in South Korea, are as simple to use as a pregnancy test, and will be supplied to low- and middle-income countries for less than $5 each. Importantly, they don’t require access to laboratory equipment or scientists to produce a result. They do still need a clinical swab to be taken from the person being tested, but further work is under way to develop similar tests that only need saliva samples or nasal swabs to work, which are much easier to collect. One of the tests has already received emergency approval from the WHO; the other is expected to get it shortly. The new rapid diagnostic tests detect Covid-19 antigens (proteins that are part of the virus) rather than the virus’s genetic material, and are able to produce a result in less than 30 minutes. By contrast, the turnaround time of PCR tests can be hours or even days. The new tests have been evaluated in communities where there’s a high level of coronavirus transmission, and have been shown to be most effective at detecting the disease between two days prior to the onset of symptoms and 5-7 days after symptoms have become apparent. This is the time when the amount of virus present in a person (what’s known as the “viral load”) is at its peak. Under these conditions, the “specificity” of the new antigen tests, which refers to the proportion of people who don’t have the infection who test negative when taking the new antigen test, compares well to PCR testing. So does their “sensitivity”, the term given to the proportion of people who do have coronavirus and generate a positive test. Coronavirus has magnified the inequalities in access to healthcare across the world. Currently, high-income countries are undertaking around 290 tests per 100,000 population, whereas low-income countries are able to undertake around 14 tests per 100,000 population. The ability of low- and middle-income countries to effectively contain the virus and stop it from spreading has been limited by their access to scalable, affordable, reliable and easy to use tests. These new rapid diagnostic tests are a major step forward in this regard. But these new tests aren’t just significant for low-income countries. They could be useful in high-income countries too. In countries such as the UK, where testing capacity has proven inefficient and slow in the face of a rapidly spreading virus, these new diagnostic tests could be used to investigate localised outbreaks when demand exceeds the capacity of PCR testing facilities. The WHO is working to implement these tests around the world, particularly in continents such as Africa and South America that don’t currently have access to sufficient testing resources. One hundred and twenty million of the new tests have been secured, and they will be rolled out from next month. But the WHO only has seed funding to support this programme, and urgently needs additional funding to ensure it reaches as many people as possible. Though PCR testing will remain the “gold standard”, the new rapid antigen tests are a useful tool for managing the pandemic. As we’ve often heard during this crisis, viruses don’t respect national borders. So it’s critical that every nation is able to deliver effective testing, contact tracing and isolation programmes. Ensuring that cheaper, easy and reliable tests are available to low-income countries isn’tjust a moral issue. It’s good science, too. • Dr Charlotte Summers is a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge",2020-09-29 14:10:28+00:00,108139,2
108190,commentisfree/2020/sep/29/coronavirus-act-liberties-powers-police-public-health-crisis,Opinion,The Coronavirus Act is an attack on our liberties. MPs must seize this chance to scrap it | Martha Spurrier,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/coronavirus-act-liberties-powers-police-public-health-crisis,"“Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,” is something I’ve heard often these past six months. Such framing is dangerous. It’s like saying “anything goes”. Yet it’s often invoked when people talk about the government’s response to the pandemic and specifically the Coronavirus Act, the biggest restriction on civil liberties in a generation. Even though this enormously powerful act passed in a single day early on in the pandemic in March, MPs of all parties knew how dangerous it was. They noted that its powers were “unprecedented” (Ian Blackford, SNP), “alarming” (Edward Davey, Liberal Democrats), “extraordinary” (Theresa Villiers, Conservative). MPs called for it to be scratched from the statute books as soon as possible. The opportunity to repeal this act is on Wednesday, when MPs will vote on its renewal. It must be seized. One of the act’s most outrageous powers is to give police the right to detain any one of us they deem “potentially infectious”. This measure, under section 51 and schedule 21 of the act, is completely unjustified, and so broad it invites misuse. . Even the Crown Prosecution Service was so concerned about the misuse of this power that in May it launched a monthly review of every single charge. The reviews published so far have concluded that every single charge under this part of the act has been unlawful. The first person to be wrongly convicted under schedule 21 was Marie Dinou, a black woman. A joint investigation by Liberty and the Guardian revealed that, under the lockdown regulations – which are separate to the Coronavirus Act – people of colour were 54% more likely to be fined than white people. Other restrictions in the act may seem reasonable, for example around mass gatherings, but this effectively bans protest. It’s true that necessary and proportionate restrictions on protest are permissible under human rights law. Yet the Coronavirus Act contains no explicit protection of our right to protest. And while banning protest in a pandemic might seem “safe” for some, it doesn’t feel like that for a Black Lives Matter protester whose safety is often the last concern of the state. The home secretary responded to Black Lives Matter by claiming the protests were illegal. Be in no doubt, snuffing out dissent is very attractive to those in power. Elsewhere in the act, the government stripped away vital safeguards from people experiencing mental health problems, disabled people and older people – arguably those most at risk during this pandemic. Liberty’s lawyers have heard some distressing stories, including that of a terminally ill ex-serviceman who could not register for food or receive support from social services so was forced to survive on packets of crisps. This is because the Coronavirus Act weakens protections for those in need of care – allowing local authorities to apply “easements” – and leaves some people without care altogether. A 90-year-old disabled Liberty member whose wife passed away at the start of the pandemic was contacted by social services, but his needs were not addressed, leaving him lonely and suicidal. These are not exceptions. Disabled people and older people are not the only ones abandoned by the government’s response. Migrants were either completely forgotten or deliberately ignored. Anyone with unsettled status is effectively barred from state support. The hostile environment prevails, even in a pandemic. Liberty has always supported proportionate action to tackle this pandemic. But the powers within the Coronavirus Act can never be justified. As public health experts have been telling us again and again for the past six months, criminalisation and watering down rights are not solutions to a public health crisis – people need support and information to be able to stay safe and take care of one another. The act’s other chilling powers include allowing the government to postpone elections and close borders. And while it has been widely reported that the legislation will lapse after two years, read it carefully and you’ll see that any part of it can be extended for a further six months – with indefinite renewals possible, without prior parliamentary approval. As for democratic process, this act has done untold damage. Its very existence normalises the concentration of extraordinary power in the hands of the government and the police. It sends a signal to authoritarian regimes the world over – when people think extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, take full advantage. This week’s vote could not have more riding on it. • Martha Spurrier is a British barrister and human rights campaigner, and the director of Liberty",2020-09-29 09:48:58+00:00,108191,2
108375,commentisfree/2020/sep/28/tory-revolt-coronavirus-rules-boris-johnson-secure,Opinion,The Tory revolt against new coronavirus rules shows Johnson is not secure | Simon Jenkins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/28/tory-revolt-coronavirus-rules-boris-johnson-secure,"For rule of six read rule of 50. It is hard to believe that the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, will appease Boris Johnson and refuse this week’s amendment to the Covid lockdown bill from the Tory backbench leader Graham Brady. Brady wants parliament to be free to monitor Johnson’s six-month emergency pandemic bill of unprecedented curbs on personal liberty. He claims to have 50 Tory MPs behind him, enough to get his way. Britain cannot allow its ruler dictatorial powers for a full half year. It might be otherwise. Were Britain’s test-and-trace regime remotely operational, were its Covid “case rate” better than near random (as it is related only to testing), had the government communicated convincing evidence for social distancing, and were sufficient economic counter-measures in place, public confidence might be greater. None of this applies. Rumours that Johnson’s science advisory group, Sage, wants a two-week lockdown as a “circuit breaker” have been the last straw. On whose say-so, on what evidence, with what degree of criminal enforcement? Johnson says he could bring in the army, Trump-style. This week has seen the astonishing sight of students in Manchester and Scotland having been first allowed back to college and then at once incarcerated for some of them predictably testing positive. This has led to medieval scenes of the imprisoned having to be fed by their families through the bars. There is no information that any of these students are actually ill. Meanwhile, parliament’s bars were briefly freed – until a U-turn on Monday – from the 10pm curfew. Discipline is in chaos.
This is Johnson’s individual doing. He is not a party man. His support within the Tory hierarchy is based purely on his 2019 success in securing a Commons majority of 80. But these are not normal times. Johnson’s rating is falling. One poll at the weekend showed his popularity and that of his party falling for the first time behind Labour and its leader Keir Starmer. Johnson’s Commons base was built on Brexit-voting seats, while his popular vote showed barely any advance on Theresa May’s in 2017 – 13.9m against her 13.6m. This man is not secure. Finding a focus of power in Britain at present is hard. There are rumours of rifts between Johnson’s secretive government scientists and his popular chancellor Rishi Sunak. His powerful aide, Dominic Cummings, is toxic to both the cabinet and parliament. As happened under May, a leadership vacuum in Downing Street sees power inevitably drift towards the Commons. Brady’s amendment is hardly outrageous. It offers reassurance to the nation and thus a safety valve to Johnson. It would give parliament some steerage over a government that is now all at sea. It would give Johnson some space to breathe. He needs it. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",2020-09-28 11:56:58+00:00,108376,67
108556,commentisfree/2020/sep/27/britain-failure-covid-surge-disaster-test-trace-virus,Opinion,Britain's failure to learn the hard lessons of its first Covid surge is a disaster | William Hanage,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/27/britain-failure-covid-surge-disaster-test-trace-virus,"Britain is in the grip of an extraordinarily dangerous outbreak of forgetfulness. During the spring, more than 50,000 people died – far more than the yearly total for any flu outbreak in living memory. Deaths are, sadly, an expected outcome of any pandemic. But this experience is also an opportunity to learn – assuming governments are willing to do so. Since the first outbreaks of Covid-19 early in the year, scientists and governments have learned a lot about the virus. They’ve learned that the best way to fight it is through testing, tracing and isolating – and they’ve learned what the consequences of not fighting it can be. But the UK seems to be ignoring most of these hard lessons. Instead of evidence-based policy, its response – initially urging people back into offices, outsourcing testing and tracing to corporate giants, and opting for half-measures in the face of a virulent second wave – looks more like policy-based evidence. It’s increasingly clear that soaring rates of disease during the spring began with undetected mild infections, particularly among younger people. Because younger people typically have less severe cases of Covid, they are more likely to be missed by testing targeted at those with visible symptoms. This is one of the lessons from the first wave. But in England, testing is still overwhelmingly targeted at those who have one of three symptoms, even though the true list of symptoms continues to grow. Its contact-tracing system, a key part of controlling the spread of the infection among those who may be asymptomatic carriers, has been widely ineffective (in the Covid hotspot of Bradford, tracers were only able to reach 42.5% of identified close contacts). And its testing system is in disarray, struggling with a backlog of some 200,000 tests, with some people being asked to travel hundreds of miles in order to secure one. Once a large number of infections has built up in the young, they start to infect older people. During the summer, we saw this happen across the US sun belt – the south-east and south-west. This was spared the grim experience of the north-east back in the spring, but cases surged as governors rushed to reopen. Between them, Florida, Texas and Arizona have now reported more than 1.5m infections. At the beginning of the sun belt surge, politicians claimed that infections in younger people weren’t cause to worry, because they were unlikely to get seriously ill. But young people still transmit the virus, and many people have since died – more than 30,000 and counting in Arizona, Florida and Texas. This was predictable. Indeed, it was predicted. In the global league table of incompetent pandemic management, the UK is doing something highly unusual. Its school year is starting with minimal infection control. Teaching is conducted in person and masks aren’t mandatory, unless you’re in a coronavirus hotspot. Kids are grouped into “bubbles” as large as 300 students, which amounts to less of a bubble and more like the planet Saturn (rings included). The government has repeatedly minimised the threat of coronavirus. At the same time, it has lost control of its testing system during the most crucial moment since the initial surge of coronavirus cases, when greater demand for testing could have been easily foreseen. This is a disaster: England has been effectively blinded to where and how the virus is spreading. Successfully grappling with Covid-19 through the autumn and winter months relies on the deeply unsexy term “situational awareness”. This means knowing what is really going on, so we can take action where it’s needed and earn people’s trust. Though targeted local lockdowns are a smart way to bring the virus under control, they rely on adequate testing to identify where and at what rate the virus is spreading (situational awareness). Without this, the government is playing whack-a-mole with its eyes closed. Ministers had months to prepare for the inevitable rise in cases that would accompany reopening schools, and to ensure the testing and tracing system was up to scratch. Although children are very unlikely to suffer serious illness as a result of infection, they can still transmit the virus to others. Like many young people, children show fewer signs of being infected (even more so among the very youngest age groups). Because of this, scientists have found it hard to estimate the number of infections in children and their overall contribution to transmission. Coronavirus isn’t like flu, where schools become hotbeds that drive the spread of a virus. But this doesn’t mean that schools are wholly benign. Despite the role that schools play in transmitting coronavirus, politicians including the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, have previously said they could open with minimal consequences, or suggested that children are “immune” to coronavirus and do not transmit. It’s hard to compare the UK’s education system with that in the US, where I live, not least because school districts here vary so much in what they are doing. But I can tell you about what has been happening in my local school district. At present, all classes are conducted online. When schools open in a few weeks, twice-weekly testing will be available for teachers and staff in schools who request it. Masks will be worn by all students, teachers and staff, and those students who want remote learning will be able to get it, resulting in fewer kids in each “bubble”.
And in Massachusetts, my home state, we’re currently running more than 17,000 tests a day with a positivity rate of less than 1% and rates of community transmission that, while not as low as we might like, remain stable (despite what many might wish, we have not attained “herd immunity”). Universities even have their own dashboards reporting the results of thousands of tests. There’s a reliable spot to get tested around the corner from where I live, with a line out the door that stretches all the longer for everyone being six feet away from each other. People can even get a test if they wish to visit neighbouring Maine for the weekend. You know what it has been like trying to get a test in the UK. Why the difference? It might be because the per-capita mortality here in Massachusetts during the spring was much worse than in the UK, and those recent memories make it easier to justify tough restrictions – and illustrate the risks of losing control of the pandemic. The north-east of the US is bloodied, but it has so far avoided any serious resurgence of the virus, possibly because the hard lessons of the first wave have been taken seriously (even if the federal government is still disgracefully absent). While the pubs in England stay open until 10pm, and home visits are still allowed between households, bars in Massachusetts will remain closed until a vaccine becomes available. In the spring I despaired that the UK was not learning the lessons of its neighbours. Now it is not even learning the lessons from itself. • Dr William Hanage is professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard",2020-09-27 12:02:14+00:00,108557,2
108597,commentisfree/2020/sep/27/where-is-the-voice-of-the-left-as-libertarians-annex-the-covid-19-debate,Opinion,Where is the voice of the left as 'libertarians' annex the Covid-19 debate? | Kenan Malik,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/27/where-is-the-voice-of-the-left-as-libertarians-annex-the-covid-19-debate,"“Not all heroes wear masks.” So tweeted Tory contrarian Toby Young in July after fellow freedom warrior James Delingpole posted a selfie of himself maskless in a supermarket. How daring. How heroic. The tweet was revealing not just of how degraded debates about “freedoms” and “liberties” have become, but also of how a certain cabal of rightwing libertarians has come to dominate the discussions on these issues. One reason they have been able to do so is because too many on the left have vacated the space. This week, the Coronavirus Act 2020, which became law in March, giving the government emergency powers to deal with the pandemic, is due for renewal by parliament. There has been criticism of the law from civil liberties groups and from a handful of human rights lawyers. Opposition, both inside and outside parliament, has, however, come mainly from the “libertarian” right. Yet the powers that the government has given itself should be a crucial issue not just for Tory rebels or rightwing contrarians, but for all those who take the pandemic seriously but also take seriously questions of liberty and of the need for proper scrutiny of government actions. The pandemic is a major public health emergency that makes restraints on liberties inevitable. Such restraints ought, however, to be proportionate. And they should involve measures that work. In Britain, the government has grievously mishandled virtually every plan to reduce Covid-19 infection rates, from inadequate PPE to a catastrophic policy towards care homes to the debacle of test and trace. It has combined such failures with the imposition of more authoritarian regulations, which seem less about bolstering the wider coronavirus strategy than about compensating for its failures.
Requiring people to wear masks in shops or on public transport is proportionate (and the opposition to it pathetic, not heroic). But allowing the police to detain anyone they have “reasonable grounds” to suspect is “potentially infectious” (as the Coronavirus Act does), or imposing £10,000 fines for organising protests, or making mass surveillance easier, should more than give us pause. As last week’s report of the parliamentary select committee on human rights puts it: “It is unacceptable that many thousands of people are being fined” when “regulations contain unclear and ambiguous language”, the police “do not fully understand their powers” and a “significant percentage of prosecutions have been shown to be wrongly charged”. Worse than the act itself is the fact that so many regulations have been pushed through by ministerial decree with little or no parliamentary scrutiny, making use both of the Coronavirus Act and the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. The Hansard Society has found that, since the start of the pandemic, the government has made law using “statutory instruments” 242 times. Statutory instruments are a means of bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. They can be made either “affirmative”, requiring retrospective parliamentary approval, or “negative”, which ensures that the regulations remain in place unless parliament annuls them within 40 days. The vast majority of statutory instruments relating to coronavirus have been negative, meaning that ministers are making law by default. There is certainly public support for tough coronavirus regulations. According to polls, 78% of the British public back the latest government restrictions and almost half think those restrictions should be even harsher. It’s a public mood that has been shaped by government policy. Rather than build on the community-mindedness that flourished at the beginning of the pandemic, the government has helped inculcate mistrust. From the constant finger-pointing to support for snooping on one’s neighbours, ministers have encouraged the idea that other people are the problem. Rather than nurturing the public’s social instincts, they have continually threatened to impose sanctions on those who break rules. The starting point seems to be that people won’t do what is necessary, so we need to force them to – not a useful way of fostering social trust and solidarity. The widespread support for government regulations paradoxically reveals the need for greater vigilance. It’s precisely when so many support government by diktat that those diktats should be particularly closely scrutinised. It would be a calamity if such scrutiny was confined to those who imagine that not wearing a mask is heroic or have an ideological opposition to pandemic restrictions. From free speech to civil liberties, much of the left has in recent years retreated from issues that once helped define it. This has given a free pass to the libertarian right both to don the mantle of freedom and to distort its meaning. The left needs urgently to rediscover its old passion for liberty. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",2020-09-27 07:15:38+00:00,108598,2

The curfew is one of the additional restrictions imposed by the governments in Westminster, Wales and Scotland last week as Covid-19 infections continue to rise. Despite the concerns the move raised, on the brink of a second wave of coronavirus, the urgent question facing Britain is whether these restrictions go far and fast enough? The question has polarised political – and, to a lesser extent, scientific – opinion. There are echoes of mid-March, when many scientists were criticising the government for being too slow to act. But we should in theory be better poised to deal with a second wave: we know more about how the disease spreads; Boris Johnson’s government has had months to set up a test, track and trace infrastructure; the NHS has had time to prepare a strategy to keep elective treatment going; mask-wearing is much more prevalent. The balance of scientific opinion is that the government is, again, acting too slowly to lessen risky social contact. Many scientists, including some of those on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), have expressed scepticism that the 10pm curfew and encouraging people to work from home will much reduce the spread of infection. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, agrees: she has introduced tougher restrictions in Scotland, banning households mixing indoors in people’s homes and has made clear she would have gone further if she had been able to introduce more economic support. Johnson appears to have again been swayed by backbench libertarians concerned about the economic impact of further restrictions and outliers among scientists who say there is no point in taking further steps and that shielding the most vulnerable is preferable. But the country does not face a dichotomous choice between laissez-faire and a three-month lockdown of the sort imposed between March and May in which even elective NHS treatment was cancelled.
Imposing tougher restrictions on certain types of contact, such as household mingling, will make other types of necessary social contact safer, such as non-Covid-19 treatment in the NHS or school attendance. We know from the first wave of the infection that it is impossible to shield older and vulnerable people who need care while the virus is spreading unchecked and we are only just learning about the debilitating impacts of long Covid. And considering both economic cost and mental health, it would be better to take tougher action now rather than leave it too late and end up in a situation where the government is forced to impose a full lockdown in a few weeks’ time. The risk of this is compounded by the sheer incompetence and abject lack of strategy at the heart of Johnson’s government. Studies suggest that targeted testing combined with effective track and trace can reduce the rate at which the virus spreads by up to 26%; the next fortnight is a critical window during which track and trace can reduce the spread before infection rates are too high for it to make much difference. Yet despite Britain testing at higher rates than many other countries, the testing system has been overwhelmed; there was no strategy to prioritise access to testing, while 90% of tests take more than 24 hours to return a result, which undermines the efficacy of track and trace. As a result of the government going for a “call centre” rather than “shoe leather” model of contact tracing, despite warnings from experts, contact rates are far too low. And at a time when the prime minister should be building the social solidarity that encourages compliance with self-isolation, he is divisively trying to shift the blame for rising infection rates to the public, particularly to young people, despite the mixed messaging over the summer that pushed people to do their bit by returning to the office and socialising in restaurants and bars.
It is the same story right across government. On the economy, the furlough scheme is coming to an end and its smaller-scale replacement, according to the Resolution Foundation, “will not significantly reduce the rise in unemployment”. The chancellor’s reluctance to target decent levels of support at the hardest-hit sectors means millions are likely to suffer months, if not years, of unemployment on paltry levels of benefit, with little support for retraining to help people adapt to the impending structural economic shifts. There will be a profound impact on intergenerational poverty; the lessons of previous recessions are simply being ignored in the hope that a recovery will magically materialise. The government also continues to fail young people in this pandemic. Thousands of students are now self-isolating in box rooms in student halls. Many of them are 17- and 18-year-olds away from home for the first time, who, understandably, feel aggrieved that they were encouraged to move to campus to start their courses when much of their teaching is online only and their social activities are so restricted. This was entirely predictable, given the lack of mass regular testing at many universities. Yet the government failed to produce a national strategy for universities, despite the warnings from Sage that they would develop into transmission hotbeds, presumably to avoid incurring any costs associated with doing things differently. We have always acknowledged that this pandemic is an extraordinary challenge: the toughest of tests for any government. Many aspects of the science remain uncertain; epidemiological modelling remains imperfect; there remain no easy choices. Yet, time and again, the government’s incompetence, indecisiveness and apparent indifference to the hardships this crisis is imposing mean Britain is condemned to bear a greater load than is necessary.",2020-09-27 05:00:35+00:00,108637,2
108727,commentisfree/2020/sep/26/next-pandemic-coronavirus-prepare,Opinion,The next pandemic is on its way. Coronavirus must help us prepare for it | Sally Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/next-pandemic-coronavirus-prepare,"We are at a crossroads. As the impacts of Covid-19 continue the world over and the second wave moves through Europe, we have a choice to make. Will we simply respond to the here and now, or do we take a moment to stop, look up and see beyond the horizon of this pandemic towards the next one? Because there will be a next one. Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last health emergency we will face. My fellow scientists estimate that we will face a pandemic or health emergency at least once every five years from here on. There is a chance that this is the optimistic scenario. The reality could be far worse. Recognising this, we can, and must, say “never again”. We must do better to identify the next health threat, respond to that threat before it becomes an epidemic or pandemic, and if it does, recover in a way that does not exacerbate health, economic and social inequalities. So how do we do better? Looking back over my time as the chief medical officer of England, I know that the answer comes in two parts: we must capture and share lessons learned now so that we do not repeat them again, and we must force ourselves to think and act differently. It is inspiring to see one of the largest mobilisations of the global medical community in search of a vaccine, therapeutics and diagnostics. This effort is a time-critical endeavour and one that rests with some of our best medical minds. But beyond the search for an exit route to this crisis, our thoughts must turn to what we can do for the next: what preparations could we have made five years ago that would have better protected us against this outbreak? What have we already learned from this current crisis to inform our understanding of future health emergencies? How can we harness today’s sciences for tomorrow? How do we ensure that we are better prepared next time? I am convinced that the answers to these questions (and more) can be found only through inquiry by minds from outside and inside the traditional public health ecosystem. I sat on the executive board of the World Health Organization for two years and saw from that experience how preparedness requires the input of individuals across a range of disciplines and sectors. Our economists, our behavioural and molecular scientists, our data experts – these and others are all critical players in the promotion and protection of global public health. We need to reject siloed thinking. We need to leave barriers behind. We need to question assumptions about who can help in this crisis and open our horizons for change. Analysis that extends beyond geographic, disciplinary and organisational boundaries has huge potential for all of us, everywhere. After all, the solutions we need could come from anyone and anywhere. So we must foster boundary-spanning insights and innovation through groundbreaking collaborations across society and between sectors. This is why I am proud to have launched an initiative that brings together some of the world’s best thinkers, promotes the use of advanced analytics, and enables unparalleled access to data that will help develop and drive solutions so that we can protect 1 billion more people from health emergencies. The Trinity Challenge fosters collaborations between organisations and individuals across sectors: it is a coalition of data science and public health where the outcomes and benefits will be made global and accessible to all. The founding members range from Microsoft to Imperial College London, from Tencent to Google, from GlaxoSmithKline to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. By tapping into the power of diverse data and insights, and focusing on the three key streams of identification, response and recovery, the Challenge seeks to bring about new ways to better predict and prevent outbreaks and improve the economic and social responses to health emergencies. What solutions are we looking for? Imagine if we had an early warning system that could help us identify the medical, environmental or behavioural trends that indicated an impending health threat; for example, the analysis of sewage could have warned us about Covid-19 long before hospitals had been able to make any connections to the virus. The location, timing and type of emerging risk can all be better understood with the use of data. Likewise, there are also many insights we can take away from our own personal experiences of Covid-19, and with the help of behavioural science experts we can tell which intervention measures are most effective. We need to ask questions such as: what message, from what person, on what platform, at what time, means I will now wear a face mask? Finally, the frontier of new economic thinking can be applied to ensure that the road to recovery does not exacerbate existing inequality or levels of poverty in the process. Humanity has the means to ensure that a pandemic like Covid-19, disrupting and destroying lives and livelihoods, never happens again. However, as Einstein warned us: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” This is a moment in history when we have a chance to think outside the box. We have not only the responsibility to do better but, for now at least, we have the opportunity. • Sally Davies is master of Trinity College, Cambridge and a former chief medical officer for England",2020-09-26 10:00:12+00:00,108728,2
108736,commentisfree/2020/sep/26/i-used-to-be-ms-covid-casual-but-with-a-sick-sister-thats-changed,Opinion,"I used to be Ms Covid Casual. But with a sick sister, that’s changed | Hadley Freeman",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/i-used-to-be-ms-covid-casual-but-with-a-sick-sister-thats-changed,"Five months ago, I wrote about my sister, a junior doctor at a large hospital, and my fears for her as she worked on what is frequently described as “the frontline” of the Covid-19 crisis, as if she were a soldier at war, as opposed to someone who just wanted to make people feel better. Well, grab me a turban and call me Mystic Meg, because you’ll never guess what happened next. She got coronavirus. Pretty badly, actually, since you ask, around the end of March. While death is obviously the worst possible outcome of Covid-19, there are, it is increasingly clear, other bad ones. My sister is now suffering from long-term Covid, known to doctors like her as “post-acute Covid-19”. According to the British Medical Journal, about 10% of people who are infected still feel the effects more than three weeks later. In my sister’s case, it’s been six months. When she first got sick and tried to maintain that always-encouraged attitude – positivity – she would think ahead to the autumn, being back at work in the hospital, going for long cycle rides. Instead, she can’t walk to the end of her road without becoming breathless. It doesn’t improve. It just is. Last week, the BMJ published a letter from a group of doctors, all with post-acute Covid-19. I talked to a few who had signed it, and they spoke about their frustration that so much of the focus has been on the numbers of positive tests, the hospital admissions and deaths, while the aftermath of the illness has been relatively overlooked. Partly this is because it’s hard to track: many who suffer from it were never admitted to hospital; or they became ill before testing was available; or they got a false negative. But it’s also because no one knows what the hell to do. “It’s like HIV or syphilis, in that it presents one way but can manifest in many,” one doctor told me. As well as the lungs, it can damage the heart, the kidneys, the nervous system, the brain. Another doctor spoke of his fear that Covid-19 will “fall into that basket of hard-to-treat conditions, like ME and chronic fatigue syndrome”. Others described long waits to be seen at a post-Covid clinic, only to be told to rest and wait because – well, what else can anyone suggest? It is known that certain factors exacerbate risk of death from Covid – age, underlying health conditions, ethnicity – but long-term Covid, as far as we know, follows no such pattern. Anyone can get it, and that, the doctors all said, needs to be clearer in the public messaging. I have to admit, I was initially a little blithe about the virus. Oh sure, I wore my mask – I’m not Ian Brown – but all my efforts felt like they were for someone else: my parents or elderly friends. If I got it, I quietly thought, would it really be so bad? Two weeks in bed without seeing anyone actually sounded… a tiny bit awesome? Lord knows I could do with the rest. Since then, I’ve had to mentally reframe the risk factors and the way the future could play out. Will I still be able to walk my kids to school in two months’ time? Will they even be at school? The whole of the past four years have been an arduous exercise in staying upright on constantly shifting sands. The Brexit referendum and the ensuing chaos, followed by the election of President Trump, changed the way many of us in the UK or US or (hi!) both feel about the places we live. No one can predict the outcome of a US election with any certainty, but previously, we have always known that the loser will accept his or her loss. With Trump, that is very much not the case. One friend recently told me she turned down a work trip to the US this November because she feared post-election national chaos, and this does not feel alarmist even to me, formerly Ms Covid Casual. The cheerful euphemism “the new normal” is grating and a lie: there is no normal when seemingly every day brings big changes. Not being able to envisage the future is both exhausting and disorienting. I briefly – crazily – considered taking my kids somewhere for October half-term, then the localised lockdowns began. A friend invited a few of us around for dinner, then the rule of six kicked in. Will we see our families for Christmas? Our friends for new year? Who knows? The rules scrabble to keep pace with the virus’s progress, and not even doctors can predict that. Anyone puzzling over why rates of anxiety and insomnia are soaring is welcome to ask me at 4.30am, my new-normal wake-up time. Meanwhile, my sister is still sick, still trying to stay positive. But, as she knows better than most, there are no guarantees that she will ever be back to the way she was. We’re all realising that, I think, relinquishing the expectations that we’ll entirely return to our old ways, which we had previously just thought of as life. It is hard, that letting go in the dark. The weeks slip past, and we keep optimistically making plans and then pragmatically breaking them, undoing the stitches as fast as we sew them, trying to go forward, but somehow standing still .",2020-09-26 08:00:11+00:00,108737,107
108964,commentisfree/2020/sep/25/covid-students-travel-university-freshers-glasgow,Opinion,Why do students travel to university? Covid has proved they don't need to | Simon Jenkins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/25/covid-students-travel-university-freshers-glasgow,"Who ever thought it a good idea to disperse 2 million Covid super-spreaders across British cities this month? One hundred and twenty-four returning Glasgow students have already tested positive, with dozens more at Aberdeen, St Andrews and elsewhere. Six hundred are now confined to their Glasgow lodgings and told they may have to stay there through Christmas. Now this fiasco is to be repeated in England as freshers’ week gets under way there too. At the same time as this mass return to campus, the Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon is banning most households from meeting even their next-door neighbours, the most severe curb of personal freedom in this phase of the pandemic so far. Yet teenagers who have won the privilege of a university place have also won the privilege of travelling as far as they choose from home and meeting thousands of new friends. This might be called a giant exercise in herd immunity, a national version of what used to be a children’s chickenpox party. Is this now policy? When Johnson introduced the “rule of six” in England last week, schools and universities were excluded. Schools needed to stay open to allow parents to return to work, and schoolchildren are largely less affected by the virus, and by definition local. Students are not local. The tradition – and expense – of a residential university education dates from days when they were elite institutions catering for under 10% of young people. The remainder of post-school students went to local technical colleges. Today roughly half of England’s young people go to university, with about 80% of UK undergraduates leaving home to live elsewhere. The reason for such generosity to universities had nothing to do with scientific evidence. Such “evidence” has all but disappeared from British political discourse. The reason is politics. Students have votes, and universities have influence. Queen’s University Belfast has even chartered planes to ferry Chinese students to Belfast. More than 24,000 Chinese students applied to British universities this summer, and acceptances are up 14%. To hard-pressed universities, overseas students are gold. There is no way those planes are turning back. But imagine the government aiding the travel industry by flying in thousands of tourists, from China or anywhere else. We know a university education is about more than teaching. It is about the “rite of passage” of graduates through the groves of academe, a rite inherited from the monastic tradition of a residential university. But we are supposed to be in an emergency. If lockdown can allow hundreds of thousands of clever young people at least some of the delights and promiscuities of freshers’ week, what about their school-leaver contemporaries embarking on work or training, but told they must do so from home, while observing social distancing and avoiding unnecessary contact? I sense that here, as in so many walks of life, coronavirus is moving mountains. Commuting students living at home have been widely seen as inhibited, denied the socialising benefits of life on campus. Not everyone thinks that way. Manchester’s professor of higher education, Steven Jones, wrote recently that he found his “stay-at-home” students, if anything, more in touch with the world. They linked university with family and community, and were “invariably an asset, bringing important alternative perspectives and enlivening academic discussions”. No less significant is what the pandemic has done to teaching technology. Education must be the most conservative discipline on earth, rooted in “what was good enough for us is good enough for them”. Universities still live in a pre-digital world of three or four-year residential courses, leisurely holidays and medieval calendars and costumes. Parkinson’s Law reigns, with study expanding to fill the years allotted to its completion. Yet in just six months of the pandemic, universities have seen more innovation than in a century. Lectures and classes have gone online. At the London School of Economics, teachers have converted lectures into videos with library clips, inserts and YouTube interviews. Lecturers have had to become theatrical performers visible to their colleagues. Zoom classes and other devices promote feedback. Prospective students can see “trailers” of courses they may or may not want to attend. In other words, students – pandemic or not – will become digital commuters, much as will many office workers. Where they live will not matter, at least not all the time. The LSE can link its classes to 25 different locations worldwide, even adjusted to time zones. This can only transform the concept of the exclusive campus. It becomes a cross between a television studio and a wifi-enabled pub: Ye Olde Rite of Passage, perhaps open to students of all ages. Physical campuses will not be unimportant – education is also about human contact and new friends in new places – but they will be dynamic and different. Born of coronavirus out of the digital age, a new university will dawn. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",2020-09-25 07:00:03+00:00,108965,2
109357,commentisfree/2020/sep/23/england-covid-19-infections-soaring-pandemic,Opinion,England's new measures aren't enough to prevent soaring Covid-19 infections | Jennifer Dowd,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/23/england-covid-19-infections-soaring-pandemic,"The new restrictions announced by Boris Johnson yesterday, including the closing of restaurants and pubs at 10pm and increased use of face coverings, fall short of a “second lockdown” but signal that life is still far from returning to normal. While England’s true number of cases is likely much lower than in the spring due to increased testing, it is the ski-jump trajectory of recent case growth that gives epidemiologists palpitations. The cruelty of exponential growth, with cases doubling at regular intervals, is real. The flipside is that reducing transmission, even a little, can have a huge payoff in reducing the total number of infections. But to head off exponential growth, we must act sooner rather than later, especially as it can take a week or more to detect cases of Covid in people who have already spread it to others. As we saw in March, hesitation, even by a week, can have an outsized impact on the resulting scale of infections, hospitalisations and deaths. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, announced stricter measures for her country on Tuesday, limiting non-essential visits between households. Yet England has hesitated to do the same. It seems inevitable that this measure will soon become necessary, as Chris Whitty has recently suggested. What exactly we as a society should do to forestall this “second wave” is still up for debate. Earlier this week, different groups of scientists published two open letters offering conflicting views about how the UK should deal with the virus in the coming months. The first letter urged tactical shielding of the most vulnerable with fewer restrictions elsewhere, while the other recommended a strategy of overall virus suppression. While it’s important to balance controlling Covid with protecting the economy, the idea of shielding only certain groups while letting the virus rip through the rest of the population is misguided at best. We do not live in age-segregated bubbles, nor could we achieve this on even a temporary basis. Younger people work in hospitals and care homes and live in multigenerational households, carrying infections with them. The higher the rate of community transmission, the more inevitable this spillover will be – and the greater the number of resulting deaths. What’s more troubling is the presumption that Covid-19 is harmless and won’t scar younger people. This belies the mounting evidence that “long Covid” can have serious chronic impacts among younger generations. And the idea that natural “herd immunity” could be a path out of the current crisis, voiced by some scientists, relies on unproven assumptions about how long immunity from Covid lasts. Even the most optimistic belief that immunity may last a year or two, as with other coronaviruses, would still mean that previously immune individuals could become susceptible on a regular basis, renewing their ability to transmit the virus to more vulnerable people. Without suppressing the virus, strategic shielding won’t magically return us to a pre-Covid economy. While some members of society, especially young people, have shown themselves more willing to take risks as restrictions eased, many have also weighed the risks in favour of continued takeaway food and Netflix binges. Many people below the age of 65 are unlikely to want to offer themselves up to the experiment of herd immunity. The idea that avoiding lockdown measures could be better for the economy also overlooks an important fact: unless we suppress the virus, more people will voluntarily “shield” themselves and their loved ones inside, potentially leaving us with the worst of both worlds. With dozens of viable vaccine candidates and treatments on the horizon, suppressing infections in the near term is both humane and sensitive to the economic effects of an unfettered epidemic. As we’ve known for many months, the path out of the pandemic relies on using a full toolkit of strategies to buy time and deprive the virus of the fuel it needs: close social contact. It seems increasingly clear that inhaling aerosols or droplets from infected individuals talking or breathing plays a bigger role in the spread of coronavirus than surfaces. This makes masks, ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces a high priority, especially as autumn and winter push more people indoors. Rather than a lockdown switch that we turn “on” or “off”, we should be considering a panel of controls to dial up the activities that are most important to keep open, such as schools and healthcare, and those that are the least risky for transmission, such as outdoor leisure and shopping with masks. We should dial down activities strongly associated with transmission and superspreading, such as events that involve being indoors for long periods of time or loud talking. Sustained close contact, such as dining, is a much riskier activity than shopping or brief community encounters. Sadly, high-risk activities include large social and family gatherings with lots of intimate contact, and events that the hospitality industry, which will need economic support through the next six months, rely upon. Weddings and parties are among the events most often linked to large clusters. While the rule of six is supposed to deter large household gatherings, following Scotland’s lead in reducing indoor contact across households could be an important short-term tool for snuffing out current transmission chains. And in the medium-term, when transmission is lower, home visits with small numbers and proper attention to ventilation, distance and masks should be something we can dial up.
The time lag between transmission, incubation and testing makes early measures even more important. In turning the dial, we won’t know if we have undershot our target until weeks later, while exponential growth accrues in the meantime. The restrictions needed to bring down even higher levels of transmissions will be more severe, and required for longer than if they had been enacted earlier. Cutting off early exponential growth therefore pays dividends, by reducing the duration of restrictions and economic costs in the long run. In the spirit of early and effective action, the measures announced yesterday should be strengthened to further restrict indoor dining and home visits in England, and encourage the use of face coverings in all indoor settings including schools, where children and teachers spend long periods indoors with close contact and where distancing can’t necessarily protect them from aerosol transmission. Keeping kids in school should be a priority, using all the layers of protection at our disposal. To do so requires sacrifices in other areas of society, a delicate balancing of the dials to see us through the winter to come. • Jennifer Dowd is a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford",2020-09-23 13:33:07+00:00,109358,2
109391,commentisfree/2020/sep/23/freedom-loving-brits-prime-minister-state-conservative,Opinion,"‘Freedom-loving Brits’? It's not that simple, Prime Minister | Julian Baggini",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/23/freedom-loving-brits-prime-minister-state-conservative,"Why, if Britain is the great nation Boris Johnson says it is at every opportunity, has it handled the coronavirus pandemic so much worse than countries such as Germany and Italy? Like a job interviewee who “confesses” to be being “a bit of a perfectionist”, the prime minister’s answer to this question is a boast in thin disguise. “There is an important difference between our country and many other countries around the world,” Johnson told the House of Commons yesterday. “Our country is a freedom-loving country.” Johnson portrayed this as a primal impulse that resides deep in the national psyche, saying he was “deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom”. When it comes to liberty, if nothing else, the UK is world-beating. “Virtually every advance, from free speech to democracy, has come from this country,” claimed the self-proclaimed leader of the free world. This comforting myth says that our problem is simply that we love freedom too much, that our fatal weakness is also our greatest strength. It’s a narrative that is as reassuring as it is nonsensical. Johnson is talking about freedom as though it meant nothing more than the absence of state power. This is the version of liberty widely promoted in the United States, where people seem to think that the opposite of freedom is government. This was the sentiment Ronald Reagan tapped into when he said in 1986, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.” But the freedom-loving Brits are not state-haters. On the contrary, to the extent that the UK has historically been a champion of freedom it has been because of its strong adherence to the rule of law. Our liberty is protected by the knowledge that no one is above the law, not even the government. Personal freedom is lowest in countries where the rule of law is weak, either because they are without functioning states or have authoritarian regimes. However, by Johnson’s account, loving freedom makes the British less likely to follow the rule of law. “It is very difficult to ask the British population uniformly to obey guidelines in the way that is necessary,” he said yesterday. Johnson is suggesting that Brits are not so much freedom-lovers as rule-breakers. This turns our traditional narrative on its head. It always used to be those anarchic Europeans, like the Italians and Spanish, who never stuck by the EU rules, which the UK honourably obeyed. Far from heaping praise on his fellow countrymen, Johnson is in effect telling them that they have a problem with playing fair. Johnson is on surer ground if he is suggesting that the UK is less enamoured of state intervention than many of our European neighbours. But historically the light-touch British approach has defended the freedoms of the rich and powerful at the expense of those of the ordinary citizen. For example, restrictions on trade union rights makes companies freer to operate as they wish but it diminishes the freedom of employees to organise and obtain better pay and conditions. Limited regulation of housing increases the freedom of landowners, developers and landlords, but not that of tenants. Giving independent schools charitable status massively increases the freedom of rich parents to upgrade their children’s educations but it leaves the state sector weaker, diminishing the freedom of pupils denied the advantages of a fee-paying education.
When freedom simply means the absence of the state, there are always trade-offs between liberty and security, individual freedom and public health. But when we also think of the freedom to eat, to work, to have an education, to determine your own future, the only trade-offs are between different kinds of freedom, or the freedoms of different groups of people. Make people freer to mingle and you decrease the real freedom of the old and vulnerable to live their lives in safety. Give businesses the right to demand their employees go back to their workplaces and you increase their freedom to trade but not the freedom of employees to protect themselves and their families. Withdraw state support for the furlough scheme and you may cut people free from the ties of government but leave them penniless and powerless. Equating freedom with the absence of the state is an old conservative trick that suits only those who don’t need protecting. What we should be seeing in this pandemic is that freedom from constraint is empty if it leaves us unable to live safely. No truly liberty-loving nation would need persuading that the freedom to stay well and to earn a living requires both government action and the willingness of the population to follow the rules for the collective good. • Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher",2020-09-23 11:00:43+00:00,109392,67
109416,commentisfree/2020/sep/23/shielding-pub-disabled-people-covid,Opinion,Why is there so much more talk about pub opening times than about shielding? | Frances Ryan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/23/shielding-pub-disabled-people-covid,"As fears rise over the spread of coronavirus in Britain, it is remarkable how little ministers are talking about the millions of people who are most at risk. Boris Johnson addressed the nation yesterday about the fear of a second wave but made no substantive mention of people with underlying health conditions who are particularly vulnerable to the virus. Instead, there was a vague reference to avoiding “simply lock[ing] up the elderly and vulnerable”, with nothing on the extra protective measures they might take. Apparently, there was time to talk about when you can get a pint in a pub, but not how to keep disabled people safe. Around 14 million people in the UK are now under some level of local restriction, and yet there has been no word on what this means for people who were told to shield earlier in the year, other than a quick line in the House of Commons that shielding is “not necessary” for those living outside local lockdown areas. This is despite there now being more estimated current coronavirus cases than when the shielding programme was paused in August. Now there are new restrictions for the general public, should I start shielding again if I’m high risk? Does it depend on where I live in the country? Ministers say I should now work at home “if I can”, but what if I can’t? Coronavirus cases in England have almost doubled in the space of a week, and yet people with severe asthma or low immunity are still being expected to risk their lives and go into work if working from home is not possible. At the same time, there is still no reassurance for parents, who are seemingly still expected to send children with underlying health conditions into classrooms. The narrative that “no healthy child has died from coronavirus in the UK”, though accurate, is telling in its dismissal of children at high risk. This government has failed to support people with underlying health conditions from the start of the pandemic. At first it recommended months of staying at home, because it was too dangerous to leave the house, before suddenly declaring it safe to use public transport and sit in busy classrooms or offices, without any credible explanation of its shift in advice. With a lack of guidance from the government, people at high risk have been left alone to figure out what to do. That ministers have not provided a functional testing programme, or track and trace, only makes decision-making more difficult. Many “extremely vulnerable” people are still shielding long after the official programme finished in August, and haven’t seen family or friends in six months and counting. Others who can’t – say, a mother with muscular dystrophy who has to do the school run – have no choice but to risk their safety. We are entering a difficult halfway house for people with underlying health conditions. The risk is rising daily, but disabled employees have next to no protection if they don’t feel safe at work. The Equality and Human Rights Commission says employers have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people if it is less safe for them to go to work than their non-disabled colleagues, but disabled workers and carers report that in practice, they are being put at risk and even threatened with the sack. Children with disabilities are told to go back to school, but at least 20,000 in specialist schools are not allowed to go back because of safety concerns. There is no word on what will happen to the education of disabled children who are missing school, just as there is little reassurance for disabled workers. Polling by the charity Scope shows that a quarter of disabled people fear losing their job as a result of the pandemic. If the challenge for society in the coming months is to figure out how best to live with coronavirus, this is all the greater for people with underlying health conditions. The everyday parts of life – work, school, family, healthcare – will not simply go away if ignored, but rather need to be adapted in the safest way possible. Labour is urging the government to publish a long-term plan for disabled people who may have to shield, and it’s these sort of practical steps we need, from an extension of the furlough scheme for high-risk workers to adequate testing, especially for schools with vulnerable children (and parents and teachers). None of this is easy, and it requires flexibility and compromise. But the minimum high-risk families can expect is a competent government that is seen to think seriously about their lives. If the test of a civilised society is how it treats the most vulnerable, the test of a government during a pandemic is how it protects the clinically vulnerable. As the winter approaches, Boris Johnson is failing fast. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People – now out on audiobook",2020-09-23 09:08:55+00:00,109417,2
109622,commentisfree/2020/sep/22/coronavirus-global-novel-virus-world-health,Opinion,The global scale of the coronavirus disaster demands a global response | Tom Kibasi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/22/coronavirus-global-novel-virus-world-health,"The scale of the coronavirus crisis is hard to fully comprehend: globally, more than 30 million people have contracted the virus and nearly 1 million have died. The UN estimates that the pandemic will mean $8.5tn in lost output for the world this year and next. The wider social and economic costs – from poverty to mental illness to domestic violence – are almost impossible to quantify. Yet the global scale of the disaster has not been met with a global response of the same magnitude. National governments have taken often drastic action to slow the spread of the disease. But while scientists working on diagnostics, therapies and vaccines cooperate across borders, the intergovernmental response has been marked by its absence. It also reflects the peculiarly inept and lamentable crop of global leaders from Washington to London, Moscow and Beijing. The world should have been better prepared for a pandemic. From the Sars outbreak of 2003 to the Mers outbreak of 2012, it was apparent that coronaviruses could not only could make successful species jumps, but that they would result in human-to-human transmission – and that these novel viruses could prove deadly. The chaotic response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014 showed just how poorly prepared the world was to tackle known, let alone novel, pathogens. Before the second world war had been won, allied governments gathered at the Bretton Woods conference to design the institutional framework that would govern the world economy in the aftermath. It is now plain that we need a Bretton Woods for global health security. The threat to global health security from novel viruses is obvious. The current architecture is not fit to prevent a future pandemic. The World Health Organization has recorded its latest failure: bedevilled by bureaucracy and chronically underfunded, it has been reduced to yet another arena for the diplomatic contest between the United States and a rising China. Its response to Covid-19 was too slow, and was inhibited by a reluctance to be seen to be “taking sides”. But in truth, the WHO has never possessed either the capacity or capability to tackle a global pandemic, even if it had acted more decisively. More guidance issued more quickly would have been helpful – especially to those nations with weak health systems – but would not have fundamentally altered the trajectory of the global pandemic. Reforming the WHO is necessary but insufficient. We now need a global foundation for health security – an institution whose purpose is to monitor threats and take steps to counter them. A properly funded global institution would invest in scientific research around the world and create the platforms needed to rapidly invent new vaccines. It would coordinate the efforts in universities and other research institutions, working alongside national governments. It would also need to ensure sufficient vaccine manufacturing capacity to meet rapid global demand in the case of a pandemic, some of which might be redundant the rest of the time. Between them, the world’s nuclear-armed states spend $73bn annually on maintaining weapons they say they will never use. Making a permanent investment in the capacity and capability to save the world from a novel virus would be a fraction of the cost for a far more noble purpose. There is, of course, always a danger in fighting the last war not the next one. One of the biggest threats to health security comes not from novel diseases but from current treatments losing their effectiveness. A calamitous combination of antibiotic misuse (both in humans and animals) and the failure to invest in the discovery of new antibiotics could mean that now treatable infections become deadly. A new global health security institution could lead efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance through research and changes to prescribing behaviour. There are reasons to be hopeful. The turn of the millennium saw new resolve to tackle some of the biggest treatable and preventable diseases through new, focused, partnership-based institutions. In 2000, Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, was established and two years later the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria was created. These multilateral financing institutions have had a dramatic impact on global public health, between them saving more than 50 million lives. We now need the resolve to create a foundation for global health security for the good of all. • Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics",2020-09-22 12:04:04+00:00,109623,2
110144,commentisfree/2020/oct/29/england-second-wave-government-covid,Opinion,The greatest tragedy of England's second wave is that it wasn't inevitable | Charlotte Summers,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/29/england-second-wave-government-covid,"The number of Covid infections is doubling every nine days in England, and in some areas, such as the south-east, London and the south-west, the R number is now above two. These are the alarming findings from the report of the React-1 study by researchers at Imperial College London, released today. The study, which obtained nose and throat swabs from a random sample of the population in England that were analysed using a “gold standard” PCR test, shows the prevalence of coronavirus infection in England has increased across all age groups. The greatest increase has been among people aged 55-64 years, while the highest overall prevalence (the number of infected people at the time the study was carried out) was among 18 to 24-year-olds. Hospitals are now experiencing the consequences of these increased numbers of infections. On 1 September, 59 patients with confirmed Covid were being ventilated in English intensive care units. By 28 October, this number had risen to 788. The number of hospital inpatients with confirmed Covid-19 in England has also climbed dramatically from 472 on 1 September to 8,535 on 28 October. Deaths have also increased: 761 people had Covid-19 listed as a cause of death in the week ending 16 October, the largest weekly number since the middle of June. The situation we are in was not inevitable. Scientists warned that, without taking urgent action over the summer to mitigate the risks, this is what would happen. But the government did not heed their warnings. In a report published in July, the Academy of Medical Sciences outlined a “reasonable worst-case scenario” in which the R value rose to 1.7 from September 2020 onwards. They predicted a peak of hospital admissions and deaths in January and February 2021 that would closely resemble the first wave we saw in spring, coinciding with the usual winter pressures that the NHS faces. We are now living through this scenario in October. As the report highlighted in the summer, this peak was not inevitable, and had more measures been implemented over the summer, it may not have come to this point. Towards the end of September, months after the Academy of Medical Sciences report, the Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies (Sage) advised the government that a package of interventions was needed to reverse the exponential rise in coronavirus cases. These included a circuit-breaker lockdown, with people working from home where possible and no mixing between households. The measures also included closing bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms, hairdressers and other indoor spaces where people mix. And Sage also recommended transferring all university and college teaching online where possible. At this point, the government was clearly determined it wouldn’t implement these recommendations. Instead, it adopted a confusing three-tier system in England of localised lockdowns. Given the latest data from the React-1 study, it’s clear this approach hasn’t worked. Much has been written about the economic devastation caused by lockdown restrictions. But it’s important to remember that health and wealth are closely intertwined. There are significant health consequences associated with unemployment and poverty. Dead people are not economically productive, and severely unwell ones consume resources without being able to participate in economic activities. Economics and health don’t operate in isolation. A substantial surge in the number of Covid-19 cases also puts people with other health issues at increased risk of harm. The knock-on effects from the surge in cases during the first wave meant that some parts of the NHS had to suspend normal services. Researchers from UCL’s Institute of Health Informatics estimate there may be as many as 18,000 additional cancer deaths as a result of the strain the pandemic has placed on cancer care. The NHS is working hard to catch up with services that were paused to allow hospitals to cope with the first surge in Covid admissions, but there are still many people in need of surgery, investigations, and out-patient appointments for illnesses that aren’t Covid related. If the healthcare system comes under sustained pressure again in the coming weeks, as seems likely, there will be an unavoidable impact on patients with other conditions. In the spring we saw the consequences of delaying an inevitable nationwide lockdown. Every day we delay, more people are becoming infected, the scale of the problem is growing, and harsher measures will be needed for a more sustained period of time. We need urgent action to halt the spread of this virus, save lives, and protect the health of both people and the economy. • Dr Charlotte Summers is a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge",2020-10-29 17:07:47+00:00,110145,2
110419,commentisfree/2020/oct/28/england-coronavirus-covid-test-and-trace-teenagers,Opinion,How teenagers ended up operating crucial parts of England’s test and trace system | George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/28/england-coronavirus-covid-test-and-trace-teenagers,"Until a working vaccine is released and widely used, our best hope of controlling Covid-19 is testing, tracing and isolating people who might carry the disease. Even after a vaccine is produced, test and trace will remain essential, as inoculation will not be completely effective, or universally accepted. Today, it’s our only real hope of preventing repeated lockdowns, and other great interruptions to our lives. Yet the English system on which our freedoms depend is a total fiasco. The government has so far spent £12bn on test and trace. But, as a result of catastrophic mismanagement, it might as well have flushed this money down the toilet, as tracing has failed to reach the critical threshold (roughly 80% of contacts) needed to reduce the infection rate. Last week, after a further fall, the figure stood at just under 60%. To put this in context, £12bn is more than the entire general practice budget. The total NHS capital spending budget for buildings and equipment is just £7bn. To provide all the children in need with free meals during school holidays between now and next summer term, which the government has dismissed as too expensive, is likely to cost about £120m: in other words, just 1% of the test and trace budget. Because so much about this essential programme has been shrouded in secrecy, it’s not easy to see where the money has gone. But the breakdown of the system appears to result at least in part from its oversight by corporate executives (led by Dido Harding), with no relevant experience in public health and a track record of failure, rather than by professional public servants. The government has created an opaque and unmanageable hybrid system of public and private provision, in which favoured corporations have received vast contracts without competition, advertising or even penalty clauses. Public health, reorganised in the midst of the pandemic to give even greater control to Harding and her chums, is in semi-privatised meltdown. But that isn’t even the half of it. I’ve been talking to someone working on test and trace in a call centre subcontracted to Serco. I’ve confirmed their identity and job, but to protect their position, the worker wants to remain anonymous. Here’s what this person told me. Until last week, the workers at the call centre were doing the simplest job in the tracing chain, calling those who have been identified as contacts of infected people and telling them to isolate themselves for 14 days, giving them some scripted advice and collecting a small amount of data. But last week, the call centre announced that all the workers on this contract were being “upskilled”. Instead of making these simple calls, they would now be calling infected patients and discovering all their contacts over the past fortnight. To use the official terms, they have suddenly been promoted from level 3 call handlers to level 2 clinical contact caseworkers.
In its advertisements for this job, the NHS explains applicants must be at Clinician Band 6 level, who will be working as part of a team of “experienced clinicians”. You must have a health or science degree or “demonstrable equivalent experience or qualifications”; experience in “a field related to public health or health and social care services as a practitioner” and “registration with the relevant professional body”. Among your tasks are “conducting a public health risk assessment”, “providing public health advice” and “using your clinical knowledge to help escalate complex cases”. Anyone accepted for this role would be “provided with appropriate training”. But the workers at the call centre who have been “upskilled” to this level are mostly school-leavers and students, with no relevant qualifications. While the job is officially advertised at between £16.97 and £27.15 per hour, they are all being paid the minimum wage, which means £6.45 for the 18- to 20-year-olds (most of them) and £8.72 for over-25s. Serco issued an internal notice explaining this change, which was leaked to the press. From 21 October, it said, “a number of experienced agents from Serco and Sitel will assist with index case tracing”. What it didn’t say is that some of these “experienced agents” are 18 years old. The “appropriate training” for the magical transformation to “experienced clinician”, my contact tells me, lasted four hours. It was conducted remotely, as they now work from home, and consisted of a PowerPoint presentation, an online conversation, a quiz, some e-learning modules and some new call scripts. “We weren’t asked if we wanted to ‘upskill’: there was no consultation and no choice. We were just told. No one felt able to say no.” After the announcement, “I spent three hours crying about it. Other people in the team were crying and having panic attacks.” So how has it gone? “As you might have guessed, it’s an absolute shitshow.” During the first hour of the first day, three of the young tracers called people who had just lost someone they loved to Covid-19. The people they spoke to were in extreme distress. After these calls, all three tracers “were distraught and crying”, and unable to work for the rest of the day. “We had no training in bereavement counselling. Just one page of speech bubbles, with a few Mickey Mouse baseline things to say: ‘if somebody is upset, be patient’, ‘give them time to talk’. It’s not going to help if someone has just lost their husband to Covid. “Some of my colleagues are really struggling. People know their skillsets. We would never have applied for the job if this was what was advertised.” The worker added: “We’ve had nonstop messages reminding us of our nondisclosure agreements. It means they’re bricking it because they know that it’s a really shit decision. They must know we are really unhappy.” When I asked Serco to explain the decision to turn level 3 call centre workers into skilled contact tracers, it told me the instruction came from the government, so I should address my questions to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The department confirmed that it had made the decision. It seems outrageous that this crucial shift was not made public, but came to light only when the Serco memo was leaked. The department has made two striking claims: everyone who has taken on this role volunteered for it, and the level 2 job has been split in half – two initial calls are now made to each contact, one by an “upskilled” call centre worker, and one by a “qualified health professional”, who dispenses medical advice and decides whether or not to escalate complex cases. My contact flatly rejects both claims. “No, absolutely not. There wasn’t any consultation, we were just told ‘this is what we’re doing’.” As for splitting the level 2 job: “There is no other call by a trained clinician. It’s us who are asking the medical questions. We have to read out a list of symptoms and ask which ones they’re experiencing. ‘Do you have diarrhoea?’, ‘Have you experienced altered consciousness?’ etc. If the patients want health advice, we just tell them to ring 111. If they report very serious symptoms, I would flag that to a clinical lead, but it would have to be an immediate risk to self or others, and I would have to assess whether it reaches that level.” In other words, ordinary call centre workers, not professional clinicians, are “escalating complex cases”. What this represents, without any public announcement, is not only a radical deskilling but also a further transfer of work from the NHS to the private sector. Level 2 contact tracers were health professionals employed by the NHS. Now they are call centre workers employed by Serco and Sitel. Public sector clinicians are replaced with unqualified private sector workers, on the minimum wage and eminently exploitable. Upon their judgments, our health, our freedoms, perhaps our very lives depend. While public health is in meltdown, Serco’s shares are surging. It has made such profits this year that it is now considering a dividend. If it issues one, it will consist of money passed from us, via the government, into shareholders’ pockets. And this is just what we can see. We know that billions have been spent on untendered contracts with private corporations, but much of the money dispensed so far is untraceable. It has been reported that, of the pandemic spending by the DHSC, an estimated £3bn is missing from public accounts. The Good Law Project is suing to discover how and by whom the money was spent. I keep thinking of George Best’s response when asked what happened to his fortune: “I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars – the rest I just squandered.” At the same time, the NHS is so underfunded that it is now asking volunteers to fill critical positions. A recent series of advertisements called for applicants for the posts of project manager, lead data warehouse developer and business analyst to work unpaid, on contracts that would usually offer between £450 and £550 a day. People ask me, “is this a cockup or a conspiracy?”. The correct answer is both. The government is using the pandemic to shift the boundaries between public and private provision, restructure public health and pass lucrative contracts to poorly qualified private companies. The inevitable result is a galactic cockup. This is what you get from a government that values money above human life. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",2020-10-28 13:54:28+00:00,110420,2
110473,commentisfree/2020/oct/28/understanding-aerosol-transmission-key-controlling-coronavirus-wash-hands,Opinion,Understanding 'aerosol transmission' could be key to controlling coronavirus | Julian Tang,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/28/understanding-aerosol-transmission-key-controlling-coronavirus-wash-hands,"Imagine you think there are mice in your house. You can see the evidence – mouse droppings; gnawed or damaged skirting boards; holes left in food packaging. You call a local pest control team who confirm that you have mice and advise you on what is needed to remove them. Neither of you have actually had to see a mouse to reach this conclusion. The same kind of thinking can be applied to the transmission of coronavirus. We don’t need to see the virus to understand how it spreads. Recent studies from China show that patients infected with Covid-19 in clinical settings exhale large amounts of virus, which remain present in the air and can be sampled and detected. Because of this, scientists can reasonably infer that the virus contaminates its surrounding environment. People nearby may inhale it, and as the virus floats through the air, spreading further in poorly ventilated environments, those who are further away could also become infected. Importantly, scientists haven’t yet demonstrated that someone walking through a cloud of exhaled virus would develop Covid-19 from that particular exposure, and research in this area is ongoing. But there is growing evidence that the virus which causes Covid can remain in the air, and therefore pose a risk to people in that airspace. The evidence that Covid can spread via aerosol transmission takes one of two different forms. First, many scientists now think that aerosol transmission explained some early outbreaks, such as those in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, and at a choir practice in the US, where the virus was exhaled by people and may have remained in the surrounding environment before infecting others who inhaled it. Second, aerosol transmission partly explains why countries that were early adopters of policies which targeted this kind of transmission have been more successful at controlling the virus. For example, south-east Asian countries were far quicker to adopt face masks, which are shown to reduce the spread of aerosols, than many western countries including the UK. I’m not saying that aerosols are the only transmission route. Research suggests there are in fact two main ways the virus can transmit. The first is via contaminated surfaces, also known as “fomites”. The UK government emphasised this transmission route at the beginning of the pandemic, issuing public health messages that focused on hand-washing. Yet as the World Health Organization conceded in a recent Covid-19 brief, “despite consistent evidence as to … the survival of the virus on certain surfaces, there are no specific reports which have directly demonstrated fomite transmission”. This doesn’t mean that surfaces don’t play a role in the spread of Covid-19. The WHO still considers them a “likely mode of transmission”, given consistent findings about how the virus contaminates its environment, and the fact that other coronaviruses can transmit this way. But contact with contaminated surfaces may not play as big a role as we initially thought. Indeed, a review of studies by theScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested hand-hygiene policies only led to a 16% reduction in acute respiratory infections.
The other way that coronavirus spreads is likely through a combination of droplets and aerosols. Droplets are larger than aerosols; too big to remain suspended in the air, they fall more quickly on to surfaces. Aerosols are tiny by comparison and can be spread at far greater distance. Both droplets and aerosols are produced while talking, coughing, sneezing and singing, but where aerosols can remain in the air for minutes or even hours, droplets fall and contaminate surfaces from where they can contribute to transmission. In an open letter that I co-authored with many other scientists, we outlined these ideas and cited evidence from various studies suggesting that aerosol transmission is a potentially significant route by which Covid-19 is spread. Surfaces are still important, and people should continue washing their hands, but a growing scientific consensus suggests this may not be the main way that Covid is transmitted. Why does this matter? First, because understanding how the virus spreads is key to controlling it. On the basis of what we know about how Covid transmits, a combined approach that targets aerosols, droplets and surfaces, and gives priority to aerosols, is likely the best way to control its spread. This means a combination of policies, such as social distancing, face masks, improving indoor ventilation, reducing contact between households and enforcing the rule of six will all reduce the level of transmission. Many countries including Britain have already adopted variations of each of these policies. So why does emphasising aerosols as one of the main routes by which the disease spreads make any difference? The reason for recognising the virus as potentially airborne (as we do with chickenpox, measles and tuberculosis) is that this will release additional funding around the world to combat airborne infections. If Covid-19 is globally recognised as caused by an airborne virus, there will be more of an imperative to fund research and initiatives, such as improving indoor ventilation, that will be crucial to preventing the spread of this virus and others like it. Emphasising that Covid-19 can be spread through the air would allow us to add more weapons in our arsenal to fight this virus – which may be with us for some time to come.

The precautionary principle says yes | Bruce Thompson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/26/was-the-premier-right-to-delay-the-easing-of-restrictions-the-precautionary-principle-says-yes,"Since word got out at the beginning of the year that some new virus had hit the streets overseas, and it was going to be “big”, the messaging from our leaders has been critical in informing, or in some cases misinforming, the public of what we can or can’t do, and why. The general public, through the media and political leaders, has had to instantly get up to speed with epidemiology, mathematical models, infectious diseases, infection control and health economics to understand what is happening. Experts in these areas also provide information and advice to governments who then have to make extremely difficult and complex decisions based on the best interests of the community. There are still some who provide misinformation, saying for 99.9% of the community Covid-19 is a minor sniffle – what’s the fuss? That’s despite the fact that at the height of the second wave in Victoria there were just shy of 8,000 active cases, of which about 10% were in our hospitals with a life-threatening escalating pneumonia illness. Our health system was on the edge and our hero healthcare workers were being confronted with a very significant virus that was infecting their fellow workers. I know of cases in which healthcare workers indeed got infected and then unknowingly went on to infect their own children. Some sniffle!
Victoria has copped the lion’s share of Covid cases in Australia and the second wave has been brutal to a community not only coping with living in isolation, but with the uncertainty of whether there is a job to go back to. After the announcement of a state of disaster, stage four lockdowns and curfews, many were putting significant pressure on the government to produce a magical plan out of lockdown. Even though we had a clear reason to shut the state down – a rapidly increasing number of cases – the plan to open up is much more difficult mainly because we now have a pool of cases in the community, but we don’t necessarily know where. A plan was produced based on epidemiological modelling, which used a number of assumptions, and described a roadmap thought to be safe for the community and thus avoiding a third wave. Clearly, the government and the community do not want to go through this again. The majority of Victorians were happy, which is understandable, while others thought the roadmap was too conservative, and would have too great an impact on the economy. At this juncture messaging is now critical. To be fair, there was plenty of epidemiological modelling going on, however health economics and economic modelling had been relatively scant. If it has indeed been done then the messaging has been lost. After a number of weeks living in a state of disaster and stage four lockdowns, new infections and active cases reduced considerably, and the state government started relaxing restrictions. This was critical, irrespective of the numbers, because the community needed something otherwise compliance was likely to be compromised. It was better to give the community something that was low risk as opposed to dogmatically sticking to the plan. Last weekend, the average number of new cases was less than the magical five, and the community was full of expectations that we could open up in a significant way. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, as there were still a number of cases being processed which potentially were of unknown cause.
By this stage emotions were running high with the community wanting answers. Was the premier right to hold off announcing any changes to the roadmap? If you follow the precautionary principle, then yes. We are well aware that it only takes a few cases to lead to a cluster, which then leads to a wider outbreak. However, messaging is again critical, and boundaries to the conversation needed to be put in place. Yes, there was evidence of a small cluster that we needed to resolve. But as soon as that result was in there could be an immediate announcement. As it happened, all went as expected, and we have now had the long-awaited announcement to start opening up. Is it still too slow? For some, yes, but following the precautionary principle it is likely to be appropriate although this has to be balanced with the economic costs. The question now is what happens if testing on Tuesday demonstrates 10 new cases? Messaging will be critical. • Prof Bruce Thompson is an epidemiologist and the dean of health sciences at Swinburne University",2020-10-26 10:24:10+00:00,110876,2
110896,commentisfree/2020/oct/26/statistical-illiteracy-pandemic-numbers-interpret,Opinion,"Statistical illiteracy isn't a niche problem. During a pandemic, it can be fatal | Carlo Rovelli",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/26/statistical-illiteracy-pandemic-numbers-interpret,"In the institute where I used to work a few years ago, a rare non-infectious illness hit five colleagues in quick succession. There was a sense of alarm, and a hunt for the cause of the problem. In the past the building had been used as a biology lab, so we thought that there might be some sort of chemical contamination, but nothing was found. The level of apprehension grew. Some looked for work elsewhere. One evening, at a dinner party, I mentioned these events to a friend who is a mathematician, and he burst out laughing. “There are 400 tiles on the floor of this room; if I throw 100 grains of rice into the air, will I find,” he asked us, “five grains on any one tile?” We replied in the negative: there was only one grain for every four tiles: not enough to have five on a single tile. We were wrong. We tried numerous times, actually throwing the rice, and there was always a tile with two, three, four, even five or more grains on it. Why? Why would grains “flung randomly” not arrange themselves into good order, equidistant from each other? Because they land, precisely, by chance, and there are always disorderly grains that fall on tiles where others have already gathered. Suddenly the strange case of the five ill colleagues seemed very different. Five grains of rice falling on the same tile does not mean that the tile possesses some kind of “rice-attracting” force. Five people falling ill in a workplace did not mean that it must be contaminated. The institute where I worked was part of a university. We, know-all professors, had fallen into a gross statistical error. We had become convinced that the “above average” number of sick people required an explanation. Some had even gone elsewhere, changing jobs for no good reason. Life is full of stories such as this. Insufficient understanding of statistics is widespread. The current pandemic has forced us all to engage in probabilistic reasoning, from governments having to recommend behaviour on the basis of statistical predictions, to people estimating the probability of catching the virus while taking part in common activities. Our extensive statistical illiteracy is today particularly dangerous. We use probabilistic reasoning every day, and most of us have a vague understanding of averages, variability and correlations. But we use them in an approximate fashion, often making errors. Statistics sharpen and refine these notions, giving them a precise definition, allowing us to reliably evaluate, for instance, whether a medicine or a building is dangerous or not. Society would gain significant advantages if children were taught the fundamental ideas of probability theory and statistics: in simple form in primary school, and in greater depth in secondary school. Reasoning of a probabilistic or statistical kind is a potent tool of evaluation and analysis. Not to have it at our disposal leaves us defenceless. To be unclear about notions such as mean, variance, fluctuations and correlations is like not knowing how to do multiplication or division. This lack of familiarity with statistics leads many to confuse probability with imprecision. Early during the pandemic, scientists mapping and modelling the spread of the virus in the UK were criticised for estimating rather than accurately depicting how severe the virus might be. Criticisms of their “dodgy predictions” proceeded from a misunderstanding: dealing in uncertainty is exactly why statistics is helpful. Without probability and statistics, we would not have anything like the efficacy of modern medicine, quantum mechanics, weather forecasts or sociology. To take a couple of random but significant examples, it was thanks to statistics that we were able to understand that smoking is bad for us, and that asbestos kills. In fact, without knowing how to deal with probability, we would be without experimental science in its entirety, from chemistry to astronomy. We would have very little idea about how atoms, societies and galaxies operate. What is probability? A traditional definition is based on “frequency”: if I roll a die many times, one-sixth of these times the number one will show; hence I say that the probability of rolling a one is 1/6. An alternative understanding of probability is as a “propensity”. A radioactive atom, physicists say, has a “propensity” to decay during the next half an hour, which is evaluated by expressing the probability that this could happen. In the 1930s, the philosopher and mathematician Bruno de Finetti introduced an idea that proved to be the key to understanding probability: probability does not refer to the system as such (the dice, the decaying atom, tomorrow’s weather), but to the knowledge that I have about this system. If I claim that the probability of rain tomorrow is high, I am characterising my own degree of ignorance of the state of the atmosphere. We know many things, but there is a great deal more that we don’t know. We don’t know whom we will encounter tomorrow in the street, we don’t know the causes of many illnesses, we don’t know the ultimate physical laws that govern the universe, we don’t know who will win the next election, we don’t know if there will be an earthquake tomorrow. If I catch the virus, I do not know if I will survive. But lack of complete knowledge does not mean that we know nothing, and statistics is the powerful tool that guides us when we do not have complete knowledge, which is to say: virtually always. Death rates, case rates and R numbers are now a feature of everyday news coverage. A better understanding of statistics and probability would help us all not only to better understand what we know of the pandemic, but also to take wiser decisions, for instance in balancing risks and evaluating whether certain behaviours are safe. There is no certainly safe behaviour, nor a certain way to get ill. In this uncertain world, it is foolish to ask for absolute certainty. Whoever boasts of being certain is usually the least reliable. But this doesn’t mean either that we are in the dark. Between certainty and complete uncertainty there is a precious intermediate space – and it is in this intermediate space that our lives and our decisions unfold. • Carlo Rovelli is a physicist and bestselling author.

The Common Cold Unit in Salisbury was set up just after the war at a former Red Cross hospital. By the time it closed in 1990, 20,000 people had taken up its offer to be dosed with cold and flu viruses and monitored for reactions. The camps were advertised as vacations: “How would you like a cheap and comfortable holiday, everything free and no expense, and even 35p a day pocket money?” one typical advert ran in 1974. “It’s true there’s a risk of catching a cold – but in a very good cause!” Much of what is known of the way coronaviruses are transmitted is a direct result of the unit’s scientific work. David Tyrrell, who ran it for 30 years, identified more than 100 strains of the common cold virus, which had been thought to be a single type of infection. Though a cure was never found, there were occasional beneficial side effects for those involved. Information given to new arrivals seemed keen to play up the Carry On potential, advising that “chatting up other volunteers in a different flat can only be by telephone or at a very long range outside”. Despite these restrictions, romances apparently blossomed; at least one viral couple returned to the cold clinic for their honeymoon. Roll of honour In the new British Library exhibition devoted to feminist protest, even the three-foot-long, sequin-encrusted tampon created by the artist Sam Dawood for the charity Bloody Good Period is upstaged by the prison poems of Sylvia Pankhurst. For nearly a century, it has remained a mystery how the suffragette managed to write a volume of poems and a five-act play in solitary confinement in Holloway with only a single slate and a piece of chalk. That mystery has been solved by her biographer, Rachel Holmes, who has catalogued and collated hundreds of perforated sheets of lavatory paper on which Pankhurst wrote with a blunted pencil. The sheets were hidden in the underwear of her prison uniform and passed to other prisoners on release. Subsequently, the papers, bundled in envelopes, travelled with Pankhurst to her final home in Ethiopia, before being archived by the British Library among a cache of her correspondence. Their preserved presence in the exhibition, Unfinished Business: The Fight for Women’s Rights, is not only testament to the extraordinary spirit and fortitude of the suffragette, but also to the disturbing resilience of rough, beige, HM prison-issue loo roll.

Over the weekend, the prime minister sent not one, but two panicked letters to backbench Conservative MPs in the hope of dissuading them from voting this week against the government’s post-lockdown restrictions. Having been spooked by the level of discontent in the party ranks, Mr Johnson has conceded to a host of rebel demands, and intimated that rules may be relaxed in many areas from mid-December. The government’s Covid winter plan, unveiled last week, is due to take effect from Wednesday. It is already unravelling into a dangerously messy muddle. A cost-benefit assessment of the new restrictions regime, demanded by the backbench Covid Research Group (CRG), confirmed what was already known: the damage to battered businesses and the hospitality sector in particular will be considerable. The north and the Midlands, where restive “red wall” MPs now constitute a crucial part of Mr Johnson’s parliamentary majority, will be especially badly hit. MPs in the south, representing areas with low Covid infection rates, are furious that their constituencies have been lumped together with neighbours suffering higher levels of transmission. In order to avoid relying on Labour MPs in Tuesday’s parliamentary vote, Mr Johnson is doing what he always does: ducking and diving to get through. Belatedly, it seems that a greater degree of financial support will be forthcoming for pubs and restaurants. There are heavy hints that many cities and towns in the highest tier will be downgraded after a review in two weeks’ time, just before the bigger relaxation over Christmas begins. The controversial one-size-fits-all approach to counties and regions could be abandoned, despite a previous insistence that contagion between areas precluded this. The idea of cautiously counterbalancing the Christmas relaxation of rules with tough measures on either side appears to have been discarded. The prime minister’s scramble to placate his party may well persuade enough Conservative MPs to vote with the government. But the price of Tory party unity will be the credibility of the government’s strategy. In his letter to the CRG, Mr Johnson pledged to “improve our communications” and be more transparent with government data. But it is hard to convincingly present a message that changes from day to day, tailored to whichever faction in the cabinet, or on the backbenches, has Mr Johnson’s ear. In a lengthy article published on Saturday, Michael Gove warned that despite progress made during lockdown, Covid-related hospital bed occupancy remains dangerously close to its April peak. In the bluntest of terms, Mr Gove warned MPs against “comfortable evasions” of this reality. The following day, the prime minister was promising the same MPs a variety of potential escape routes from its implications. Confusion reigns. In the north, Mancunians are struggling to understand why London has apparently been spared tier 3 restrictions because of potential job losses, but the same logic did not apply to Manchester. The Covid winter plan was drawn up on the basis of scientific advice that a less onerous tier system failed to control the second wave of infections. The consequent national lockdown has done its job in driving the R rate below one across the country. Ahead of arguably the most perilous period of the pandemic, the new restrictions should now not be subject to a hasty bargaining process with anti-lockdown libertarians and “red wall” MPs in the Conservative party. They should, from the start, have been accompanied by a level of economic support that gave financial security to the businesses and individuals they affect the most. Once again, Mr Johnson’s lack of strategic grip and mixed messages are leading to confusion and resentment, making a volatile situation far worse.",2020-11-30 18:38:48+00:00,111646,67
111710,commentisfree/2020/nov/30/have-hope-uk-track-record-successful-vaccine-campaigns-covid-19,Opinion,Have hope – the UK has a track record of successful vaccine campaigns | Fiona Culley and John Tregoning,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/30/have-hope-uk-track-record-successful-vaccine-campaigns-covid-19,"The first death from Covid-19 was confirmed on 11 January 2020. In less than a year, we have not one but three promising vaccines. Subject to regulatory approval, the focus will be on the next phase: getting the frontrunner vaccines to the people who need them. The logistics of such a huge vaccination campaign are critical. From early on, while scientists were designing a vaccine and undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials, governments, pharmaceutical companies, funders and health authorities have been planning how to manufacture and deliver the vaccine to the population. The first hurdle for a mass vaccination campaign is in the manufacturing process. Not only do we need the vaccine itself; manufacturers also need enough glass vials, which will be filled in specialist facilities to ensure the vaccine remains sterile.
The next challenge is having enough doses to vaccinate as many people as possible. Initially, there will not be enough doses for the whole of the UK. The most recent information about the prioritisation of who gets the vaccine first comes from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, an independent expert group which advises the government on immunisation. The priorities combine age profiles with risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms: older people, care home staff and healthcare workers are in the top priority groups. To roll out a vaccine on a national and international scale will require maintaining supply chains for the raw materials to make vaccines, as well as materials to distribute and administer them – including syringes and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. We also need to think about how to keep the vaccine at the right temperature from factory to clinic – a “cold chain”, which poses big logistical problems, especially in countries where the electricity supply is not widespread. Different vaccines will have different requirements: one potential issue compared with existing vaccine campaigns might be the requirement for ultra-low temperature freezers for some of the vaccines. Training staff to vaccinate people will be essential, as will the huge task of coordinating people to receive the two doses of vaccines they are likely to need, all while maintaining social distance. The Royal College of General Practitioners has recently considered the logistical challenges of such a large vaccination campaign in the context of a pandemic. The good news is that we are not in entirely uncharted territory. Mass vaccination campaigns have been successfully delivered before. Smallpox, the only major human disease to be banished into history, was successfully eradicated in the late 1970s thanks to mass vaccination. More recently, a shining example of global cooperation effectively eradicated meningitis A from sub-Saharan Africa (the MenAfriVac campaign). Within a month of the MenAfriVac vaccine becoming available, 20 million people had been immunised. In the UK, too, we have ongoing experience of mass vaccination campaigns. The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, for example, was introduced in 2008 to help reduce HPV-linked cancers. By 2014, 2.3 million girls had received the vaccine and analysis shows it may protect against 90% of cervical cancers. But for the best example of a rapid and timely mass vaccination in the UK, we need look no further than our old foe, influenza. Because of the way that the influenza virus mutates, the flu vaccine needs to be given annually. It also needs to be given in quite a tight time window – between when the vaccine becomes available (about September) and the beginning of the flu season (late October). The flu jab is given to many of the same people who will be a priority for the Covid-19 vaccines – healthcare workers, older people, people with underlying risk factors for severe viral lung infection – so we can build upon existing networks as a framework to expand the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines across the UK and around the world.
It is vital to remember that vaccines are most effective when as many people as possible have them. The pandemic will not be over until the vaccine is available to everyone around the world. The UK has taken an important lead in this area, providing funding and vaccines to the Covax initiative, a programme with the explicit purpose of providing equitable and fair access for every country in the world. Domestically, the UK has maximised chances of rapid access to a successful vaccine by prepurchasing hundreds of millions of doses from different suppliers. Investment in the logistics for mass distribution, as well as new vaccine technologies and manufacturing facilities, will potentially be beneficial to increasing development and availability of other urgently needed vaccines globally, and beneficial to bio-preparedness for future pandemics. There will be tremendous challenges in delivering the vaccine. And it won’t be cheap, but it will be cheaper than the impact of a prolonged pandemic on the economy. We come at this from a place of hope. Through global collaboration, the scientific community has developed several promising vaccines; the next challenge is to administer these vaccines globally to save lives, enabling everyone to see their friends and loved ones once more. • Fiona Culley is a respiratory immunology lecturer at Imperial College London and John Tregoning is an immunology researcher also at Imperial",2020-11-30 13:59:54+00:00,111711,2
111934,commentisfree/2020/nov/29/theres-a-social-pathogen-stalking-the-world-thats-as-deadly-as-covid-19,Opinion,There’s a social pathogen stalking the world that’s as deadly as Covid-19 | Kenan Malik,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/29/theres-a-social-pathogen-stalking-the-world-thats-as-deadly-as-covid-19,"“What if tropical diseases had as much attention as Covid?” asked Francine Ntoumi, director of the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research, recently. Ntoumi was really asking two questions. What is happening to all the other diseases that ravage the global south as the world’s attention has focused on Covid-19? And why can’t we put as much energy and resources into tackling diseases such as malaria and TB as we have into stopping the coronavirus? Some poorer nations, notably India and Brazil, have been particularly badly hit by the coronavirus, through a combination of gross inequalities and the sheer incompetence and negligence of the authorities. African nations, though, seem to have been surprisingly successful. Official estimates suggest around 50,000 deaths from Covid-19 across the continent, almost half of which have been in South Africa. These numbers need to be read with a large dose of scepticism, given the paucity of testing and healthcare facilities in Africa. The true figures are undoubtedly much higher. Nevertheless, fears of an explosion in Covid-19 case numbers in Africa have, so far, thankfully not been borne out. One reason is that many African nations already have protocols in place for dealing with pandemics. Ntoumi’s Congolese health foundation was set up to monitor and combat gastrointestinal diseases, malaria, HIV, TB and chikungunya (a viral disease transmitted by mosquitos). However, it was able to “quickly pivot to diagnostic testing and blood-based epidemiological studies” for the coronavirus. Since March, she writes: “Three-quarters of our time has been spent on Covid-19.” Success in the battle against Covid-19 has, however, come at a great cost. For attention has been taken away from other diseases, with devastating consequences. So far, around 1.5 million people have died from Covid-19 worldwide. That’s the same number that tuberculosis kills every year, year after year. Some studies predict that between now and 2025, up to 1.4 million more people will die from TB than normal as cases go undiagnosed and untreated because of Covid lockdowns. Other studies suggest that deaths from malaria could increase by more than a third over the next five years. In India, registration of new TB cases between January and June this year dropped by more than 25% compared with the same period last year, while more than a third of people with TB found health facilities closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. In Uganda, the number of maternal deaths almost doubled in the first three months of this year, largely because there were far fewer births in hospitals and clinics.
Covid-19 highlights not just the lack of attention currently given to other diseases but also the lack of attention they received even before the coronavirus. A year ago, we did not know that Covid-19 existed. Three new vaccines have already been developed (two others have been approved in Russia, though details are scarce) while more than 200 are in various stages of development. TB has afflicted humanity since antiquity. Yet there is just one TB vaccine and it does not work well in adults, while a handful of possibilities are in the pipeline. There is currently no established vaccine to protect against either HIV or malaria. The reason? A social condition that everyone acknowledges, many condemn, but few are willing to tackle head-on – health investments are based not on need but on wealth and power. In 2010, just 1% of global health research and development investments were allocated to so-called neglected diseases, mainly diseases endemic to the southern hemisphere. There were at least seven times as many clinical trials targeting diseases of relevance to high-income countries than diseases whose burden lies mainly in low- and middle-income countries. TB, malaria, diarrhoeal disease – the fact that they still stalk the world is as much the result of a social as a natural pathogen. In 1793, the Marquis de Condorcet, a great Enlightenment radical wrote, under the shadow of the guillotine, his final work, Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind. “Our hopes for the future state of mankind,” he observed, “come down to three points: the destruction of the inequality among nations, advances in equality within individual nations and the real improvement of mankind.” Two centuries on, Condorcet would probably be astonished by humanity’s technological and medical advances. When he died, Edward Jenner had yet to develop his cowpox vaccine. However, he would probably be equally astonished that the inequality among nations and within nations remains so stark, that we continue to tolerate a world ransacked by diseases that could be eliminated. Or, as Lucica Ditiu, executive director of Stop TB Partnership, has put it: “I think this world, sorry for my French, is really fucked up.”",2020-11-29 08:00:22+00:00,111935,2
112389,commentisfree/2020/nov/26/the-guardian-view-on-englands-new-tiers-dangerous-juggling-act,Opinion,The Guardian view on England’s new tiers: a dangerous juggling act | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/26/the-guardian-view-on-englands-new-tiers-dangerous-juggling-act,"The UK government’s first attempt to control the Covid-19 pandemic in England through a regional tiered system was a failure. The rules were not tough or clear enough, and there were arguments about the way in which local areas were categorised by Whitehall. The tier system was in force for less than three weeks before a steep rise in Covid infections forced the government to replace it with the second national lockdown, which remains in force. So the fundamental question to ask about the new English tier system that will operate from 2 December is whether it will be any more effective than the first one was. The answer is far from certain, not least because the new tiers, the details of which were published on Thursday, are not being introduced because the pandemic is now under greater control. Instead they are being brought in for essentially political reasons. At any other period of the year, the second lockdown would be given more time to have an effect. The numbers of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are not yet under control. There are some encouraging signs of a second lockdown effect; cases are down 19% on last week, for example. But the level of deaths remains very high. The decision to end the second lockdown is based more on Boris Johnson’s commitment – given in order to head off a Conservative backbench revolt – that it would end on 2 December “without a shred of doubt”, than on any conclusive proof that the transmission rate is now under control. The fact that the new tier system will be tougher confirms that the previous effort was too lax. It also shows that the second Covid wave is stronger now than it was in October. In Thursday’s announcement, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, placed almost the whole of England into the strengthened tiers 2 and 3. Only Cornwall, the Scillies and the Isle of Wight are to be in tier 1. That means there will be tough lockdown measures for everyone else, and the most severe tier 3 controls will continue in the majority of urban areas except London. This is close to being a national lockdown in all but name. The Johnson government is playing Russian roulette with the English people. On the one hand, it is clearly aware that tighter measures are still needed for public health reasons. On the other, it wants to appease continuing Tory backbench anger and to navigate the festive season without being accused of stealing Christmas. The upshot is measures that might work if testing was more efficient, if self-isolation was easier to enforce and if Christmas did not risk triggering another spike in infections. None of these things is the case. Instead, Mr Hancock has fallen back on his familiar instinct to get out of a tight spot by over-promising about an innovation – lateral flow swab testing – whose effectiveness is not proven and which is not yet universally accessible. In an echo of the first test-and-trace effort, these quicker tests have failed to reach large parts of the more vulnerable population in trials in Liverpool. Not for the first time, airy assurances are being made before the system has been properly reviewed and without full transparency. Every government has to juggle different and difficult pressures over Covid. The danger for the Johnson government is that this package will end up satisfying no one, from the health professionals and key workers who warn against premature easing, to the local authorities who feel they are ignored and then dumped on, to the Tory MPs who are bored with the pandemic and increasingly want to ignore it. Mr Hancock faced a succession of backbench sceptics on Thursday from counties whose voters resent, not without justice in some cases, being placed in tier 2 (or, in the cases of Kent and Lincolnshire, in tier 3). He only bought them off with the promise that the allocations will be reviewed on 16 December. That ensures that pressure to loosen the new tier system in time for Christmas is certain to mount. That would be very dangerous. Ministers have made a rod for their own backs by again following the politics not the science.",2020-11-26 18:33:40+00:00,112390,2
112432,commentisfree/2020/nov/26/heres-how-to-tackle-the-covid-19-anti-vaxxers,Opinion,Here's how to tackle the Covid-19 anti-vaxxers | Will Hanmer-Lloyd,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/26/heres-how-to-tackle-the-covid-19-anti-vaxxers,"The Covid-19 vaccines, which are up to 95% effective, have the potential to save millions of lives in the UK and many more around the world. Yet creating the vaccines is just the first step. We now need to produce them as quickly as possible, work out the logistics of distribution and administration and – most importantly – ensure as many people as possible take them. And as the history of vaccines shows, that is not as easy as some might assume. You only have to look at the fall in uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine after it was falsely linked with autism. Despite the Covid vaccines being reported as safe, a recent YouGov survey found that 21% of adults are unlikely to take a vaccine, and a further 12% are unsure. That means a third of the country aren’t confident they will take the vaccine – though reasons vary from a minority of anti-vaxxers, to a larger group of people who are hesitant and want to wait and see if it’s safe, or think they are too low risk to need it.
This resistance could potentially increase as confirmation bias – our tendency to search out and engage with content that affirms what we already believe – and polarising social media algorithms cause people to become more entrenched in their views. It is therefore vital to plan ahead of the rollout in order to ensure as many people as possible take the vaccine. Behavioural science can provide useful guidance. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, we need to handle the anti-vaxxers the right way. Though, instinctively, many of us would want to tell them they’re wrong, this is not the way to proceed. We must avoid avoid directly confronting anti-vaxxers like this, or dismissing them as crazy or stupid. It’s a human instinct that, if our strongest beliefs are directly challenged, we can end up believing them more firmly – what’s known as the backfire effect. We often have a defence mechanism that leads us to actively search out information that shows we are right. In this case if people are pushed too hard and feel judged, they’ll look for reasons to avoid taking the vaccine. This knowledge of the backfire effect should impact all of us, not just those directly connected to the rollout. We shouldn’t post on social media about how “idiotic” people who don’t take the vaccine are. It won’t help. Nor should there be public broadcasts from government ministers disparaging anti-vaccine views. And it means ensuring doctors have a non-judgmental approach when they talk to patients who aren’t sure about taking them. If we are talking to someone who’s uncertain about the vaccine we should try to be empathetic, actively listen, and focus on the benefits of taking it. And rather than contradicting them, we should suggest places where they can find out additional information. If people feel respected and trusted they are more likely to listen; and if they can find out on their own, then they will have time to process and engage with it without feeling defensive. And there are broader behavioural science tactics that the government can use to improve the uptake of vaccines, including making it seem like the default and showing it to be a social norm. This means using language that inherently assumes everyone will take the vaccines, making people feel they are actively opting out, rather than opting in. So health secretary Matt Hancock and other politicians should highlight the extent to which people are taking vaccines; making it a positive social norm. Newspapers should have headlines about high take-up rates, and the positive benefits this will have for society. It is this type of positive story we should be actively sharing and discussing, rather than looking for people to judge negatively.
This will work most effectively when people see those they feel a connection with following the rules. This means, where possible, that messaging aimed at young people following guidelines should be targeted towards young people, and the same applies to aiming messages at people in a certain social group or geographical region. We instinctively want to copy those we feel closest to, and are less likely to disregard the behaviour of those we feel are in our in-group. Finally, the government and GPs should make it easy for people to get the vaccine. In a 1965 study, students at Yale University were given information about the need for tetanus inoculations. Initially, 3% of the group got the vaccine. But when provided with a map and specific instructions on where to get it, 28% of the students got inoculations. We shouldn’t underestimate how important it is to allow people to go when they aren’t working, and to provide clear directions or support for travel, and easy lines of communication to clarify uncertainties; these things have a bigger impact than is often assumed. Hopefully, utilising a range of smart behavioural science insights will drive vaccine uptake. That’s vital, because a draconian system of enforcement could embed deeper polarisation and resistance at a time when we need cohesion and agreement more than ever. • Will Hanmer-Lloyd is head of behavioural planning at the consultancy Behave",2020-11-26 16:02:14+00:00,112433,2
112459,commentisfree/2020/nov/26/military-spending-britain-safe-overseas-aid-defence,Opinion,More military spending won't keep Britain safe – but boosting overseas aid could | Mary Kaldor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/26/military-spending-britain-safe-overseas-aid-defence,"In March, when Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it seemed as though Britain, long a nation obsessed with its imperial past and military history, had shifted its concern to the wellbeing of its citizens. The government had accepted responsibility for the safety of individuals and their families, albeit more slowly than some other European nations. Yet after all we’ve learned during the pandemic about the dangers posed by a virus smaller than a dust mite, Johnson’s recent announcement of a £16.5bn increase in defence spending over the next four years (over and above a commitment to increase the existing £41.5bn budget by 0.5 percentage points above inflation) signalled a return to business as usual. The new spending is focused on cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and a military space capability. Johnson said that he had taken this decision “in the teeth of the pandemic” because “defence of the realm comes first”. What does “defence of the realm” really mean? Johnson refers to “our people and our way of life”, yet the dangers we face as a nation aren’t traditional wars: they’re global crises such as pandemics, the climate crisis and rising inequality, as well as security threats associated with terrorism and organised crime. Rather than spending on old-fashioned military defence, the UK’s focus should be on “human security”, a version of security that begins at the level of individuals rather than nation states and considers existential threats of all kinds – from poverty to ill health. In practice, this would mean spending more on climate change action and development assistance, as well as forms of defence spending where the military plays a roll in protecting and assisting citizens both at home and abroad, not fighting wars. But the government appears more focused on traditional military defence than current global issues. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced an enormous reduction in the country’s aid budget from 0.7 to 0.5% of GDP – a move that is devastating for people living in poverty as well as those in conflict zones, and something that could well come back to harm our own security at home. And the prime minister’s recent pledge to spend £12bn on a 10-point green investment plan pales in comparison to Britain’s new defence budget. The decision to increase defence spending was taken before the integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy had completed its work. One probable message of this landmark review, which is expected to be published early next year, is that addressing global challenges so as to ensure the safety of “our people and way of life” goes far beyond military spending. Another likely conclusion is the importance of stabilising and mitigating contemporary conflicts in places such as Syria, Yemen or the Horn of Africa. These “forever wars”, as they have sometimes been called due to the fact they are extremely difficult to end, are very different from classic conflicts of the past. Not only are they fragmented and decentralised, involving complex networks that engage in both political and criminal violence, but they are both local and global in scope, and closely related to other challenges such as terrorism and organised crime that affect us at home. The UK does need a capacity to intervene in such conflicts within the framework of the United Nations, with the aim of protecting civilians, delivering humanitarian assistance and diminishing violence. But this is not the same as classic geostrategic military interventions of the kind undertaken by Russia, the US or Turkey, which are destructive and can prolong violence. Interventions in overseas conflicts should be about saving lives, not fighting wars, and ought to involve a variety of skilled workers, such as humanitarian agencies, health workers, human rights monitors and mediators. Development assistance is particularly important when dealing with these conflicts: it funds humanitarian assistance and can help people create livelihoods, providing an alternative to joining armed groups. These types of intervention might include a role for the police and the military, but only in order to protect civilians, uphold international law and create safe humanitarian spaces (indeed, the Ministry of Defence has established a centre for human security in military operations with this aim). The army can serve as a first reserve of public labour during emergency situations, helping to carry out Covid testing, building emergency hospitals or helping to build flood defences, for example. Likewise, there’s an argument that spending more on high-tech areas of defence is important to protect people at home and abroad. The UK is vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks, election interference and even attacks on key infrastructure. But it’s crucial that these cyber capabilities protect privacy and human rights, and are defensive rather than offensive. The same goes for space. The UK is still a member of the European Space Agency, which has developed capabilities for responding to humanitarian and human security issues – something to which the UK can and should contribute. But developing an independent military space presence in the form of the proposed “RAF space command” isn’t only expensive and difficult, it’s also dangerous: the militarisation of space expands the frontiers on which conflicts can take place. There is a powerful case for increasing our spending on human security issues, especially in the context of the pandemic. This has to include both climate change action and development assistance. But Johnson’s motivation seems to be more about returning us to an era of gunboat diplomacy than preventing and ending violent conflict. In his words, he wants to end “the era of retreat” and bolster “our global influence”. This global influence has been hugely diminished by Britain’s departure from the European Union, where the UK played a key role in external security policy. Cutting development spending will further tarnish Britain’s worldwide image. It is difficult to see how a vision for “Global Britain” can be achieved through increased military spending. Indeed, what is needed for keeping “our people and our way of life” safe is greater spending on human security, not on the destructive, anachronistic tools of geopolitics. • Mary Kaldor is a professor of global governance and director of the conflict and civil society research unit at the London School of Economics",2020-11-26 13:30:06+00:00,112460,67
112503,commentisfree/2020/nov/26/pandemic-earn-trust-facts-vital-covid,Opinion,Those who tell us what to do during the pandemic must earn our trust | David Spiegelhalter,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/26/pandemic-earn-trust-facts-vital-covid,"You’d be forgiven for not knowing what to believe during this pandemic. Some scientists who say their claims are based on evidence tell us that lockdown is too severe; others say that we relax at our peril. Some argue that masks are of little use, others that they save lives. So, who can you trust? During a crisis like this one, trust clearly matters. It changes what people are willing to do: whether that be wearing a face covering or getting a vaccine when one becomes available. Since the first lockdown, people have continued to trust scientists, despite their disagreements or changes in official scientific advice. But knowing who or what to believe is difficult. The philosopher Onora O’Neill tells us that rather than focusing on trust, we should focus on trustworthiness. She advises that trust happens when people show honesty, reliability and competence, presenting evidence in ways that make it accessible, intelligible, useful and easily assessed (meaning you can check the workings for yourself, if you so wish). These principles form the basis for a useful guide for those trying to communicate evidence of all kinds during a pandemic, and for those of us trying to assess what to believe, whether from politicians, scientists or media pundits. When evaluating whether something is trustworthy, it’s first worth asking whether you feel like someone’s trying to sell you something, or begging for your vote. When the government announces new rules, the evidence for them should be properly explained, and not treated as a means of persuading people how to think or act. The aim should be to inform rather than merely persuade (except perhaps in emergencies where fast action is imperative). During a crisis like this one, scientists can feel as if they’re in a communications arms race. Those trying to defend the public good against potentially dangerous misinformation can end up denying uncertainty. We saw this early on during the pandemic, when the official line on face coverings was that they were ineffective – rather than admitting there wasn’t enough evidence to evaluate their effectiveness. Too often, the message is shaped by communications professionals working to ensure the greatest number of people “get the message” rather than thinking about how to present the evidence so the greatest number of people can understand it, trust it and then decide for themselves. Yet uncertainty is the engine of science, and a sign of knowledgable humility. John Krebs, the former chair of the Food Standards Agency who dealt with numerous crises such as BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, came up with a useful checklist for science communication in such crises: say what you know, then say what you don’t know; then, having acknowledged the uncertainty, say what research is being done, what people can do in the meantime, and, vitally, that advice will change as more is learned. When judging whether a source is trustworthy, look to the evidence. If it only shows one side, ask yourself what’s missing and why, as a trustworthy source should present relevant evidence in the round. That’s not the same as claiming every argument has two equal sides; inviting climate crisis deniers on to panel discussions is not the same thing as achieving “balance”. But if someone is only telling you about the potential benefits of a measure, or citing arguments that support their position, it’s worth asking whether there are any potential harms or evidence that points the other way. Often, there are difficult tradeoffs involved with decisions – whether about lockdown or vaccines. In an ideal world, these would be clearly set out so we could make up our own minds. Of course, sometimes there’s just too much evidence to do it all justice – but a balanced summary of the pros and cons should be possible. Those who want to be judged as trustworthy communicators, whether government, media outlets or scientific groups, should carefully consider how they present this evidence if they truly want to help us make up our minds about an issue. For example, is the presentation of evidence pushing you to feel reassured, or anxious? A poster on the London Underground once proudly declared that “99% of young Londoners do not commit serious youth violence”. It’s a reassuring number – but if it were put the other way around, with “1% of young Londoners commit serious violence”, it would have had a completely different effect. Equally, when politicians and scientists refer to numbers, such as daily numbers of Covid deaths, it should be clear whether these are based on reports of death, which are higher on Tuesdays, or the actual day of death, which means recent figures will inevitably be revised upwards. Ideally, evidence would have some sort of star rating. For example, Sage reported “high confidence” that wearing face coverings outdoors has negligible impact on transmission, but “low confidence” in their estimate that closure of close-contact personal services such as hairdressing and beauty therapy could reduce R by up to 0.05. Sometimes decisions have to be made in the face of little evidence, but it should be clear what evidence there is, and how strong. The ultimate test of evidence is being able to check it yourself. If people don’t tell you how to drill down into the evidence to find out more, or where to find the data, why not?
Part of what makes humans such an extraordinary species is our ability to learn from the experience and knowledge of others – and to pass on that social and cultural learning across time and space. We don’t all have to experience losing someone to Covid-19 to recognise the virus as a serious threat and nor do we each have to invent ways to protect ourselves against that threat. We can trust the experience, knowledge and hard work of others. But in the world of competing sources we inhabit, we need to develop new ways to evaluate who really does have our best interests at heart, and the knowledge and experience they claim. It’s far better for communicators to be trustworthy from the start – to be honest about the complexities and the uncertainties, open about the tradeoffs and reasoning behind policies – than it is to simplify for the sake of an easy message. After all, there’s no easy path to the truth. But it can help to spot when it’s at least being attempted. • David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University.

113241,commentisfree/2020/nov/22/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-and-vaccine-scepticism-time-to-act,Opinion,The Guardian view on coronavirus and vaccine scepticism: time to act | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/22/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-and-vaccine-scepticism-time-to-act,"In the 1960s, academics studying rumours drew inspiration from epidemiology. They noted how such stories spread through communities, “infecting” some individuals while others seemed immune, and how more resistant populations could stop their spread. Their insights have in turn been taken up by health professionals. Hearsay can be useful, helping to catch disease outbreaks. It can also be deadly. Though vaccine hesitancy is as old as vaccines themselves, it has risen sharply in many countries in recent years. Unfounded scare stories about the safety of immunisation programmes have contributed to growing scepticism and outright refusal, with fatal consequences. In her new book Stuck: How Vaccine Rumours Start – and Why They Don’t Go Away, Prof Heidi Larson notes the paradox: we have better vaccine science, more safety regulations and processes than ever before, yet a doubting public. For the foreseeable future, demand for Covid-19 vaccines is likely to far outstrip supply. The US biotech firm Moderna has now joined Pfizer/BioNTech in announcing a vaccine with more than 90% efficacy in protecting people from Covid-19, but it will not be available outside the US until next year. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca candidate is some way further off in its work. But while many are thrilled by the prospect of immunisation – three in four adults globally have said they would take it up if it were available – the unusual speed with which these products have been developed and tested has prompted anxiety among others, including those normally sanguine about vaccines. While 72% of Americans said in May that they would definitely or probably get a vaccine, that had dropped to 51% by October. Fearmongering has played a part, with some of those responsible profiting politically or financially. Social media has produced an “infodemic”, allowing unfounded claims to spread internationally in hours or days – with algorithms pointing people toward more extreme content. Undoing the damage caused by anti-vaccination campaigns can take years or decades. Though internet companies are belatedly taking some action, more needs to be done. Yet the problem is not merely disinformation, but why it is believed. Prof Larson, who runs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, warns that simply dismissing rumours can entrench them. When people’s questions or concerns are batted away, and they feel they are being treated as stupid, doubts can grow and vaccine ambivalence turn to scepticism and outright refusal. Effective challenges to anti-vaccination messages must come before this hardening of attitudes occurs. It can feel baffling and frustrating when well-tested evidence fails to counter wild assertions and unverified anecdotes, but there is some underlying logic to suspicions. It is true that big pharma is often short on scruples; that governments don’t always make the right decisions about people’s lives; that medical staff can be dismissive of valid concerns; and indeed that vaccines are not entirely without risk. In the US, where there is a horrific history of white scientists experimenting on black people without their consent, and ongoing racial discrimination in healthcare, African Americans are much less likely than whites to say they would take a Covid-19 vaccine, despite being twice as likely to die from the illness. Good communication about the new vaccines will mean not only clarity about the advantages and safeguards, but acknowledgments and explanations of potential risks and uncertainties, putting them into context. Prof Larson argues that anti-vaccine sentiment flourishes when people do not feel a sense of dignity or control over their own lives. The last year has exacerbated such emotions, and they will not disappear when lockdowns end. Restoring confidence in immunisation may, in the long run, require the much more fundamental rethink that many hoped this pandemic might produce: a reappraisal of who and what is valued, and how we should be living and relating to each other.",2020-11-22 18:30:29+00:00,113242,2
113245,business/2020/nov/22/our-communities-around-britains-airports-are-being-devastated,Opinion,Our communities around Britain's airports are being devastated | Steve Curran and Henry Smith,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/22/our-communities-around-britains-airports-are-being-devastated,"Everywhere in Britain the financial and social impact of Covid-19 is being felt. Up and down the land, whole industries have been affected and businesses, large and small, have been forced to close. Hardest hit, though, have been the communities located around airports – those areas that provide the workers for their local airport, that rely on the terminals, the hangars and the economy that has grown up around it, for jobs and prosperity. At a stroke, with the onset of the pandemic and the collapse worldwide in air travel, that vital connection has been severely reduced. Since then, it’s worsened. There’s little prospect of aviation returning to anything like its previous levels, not even with the advent of a vaccine, not in the short term. The damage may well prove to be permanent. The immediate effects have been devastating. Our two communities, Hounslow in west London and Crawley in Sussex, have the awful distinction of heading the national league tables for numbers of furloughed and unemployed workers. In Hounslow, next to Heathrow, and Crawley near Gatwick, 40% of our workforces were being supported by the state at the end of the summer. This number is likely to worsen. It is similar for parts of Birmingham, Essex, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Teesside, Newcastle and Glasgow and the other districts where concentrations of airport workers live. Each day brings news of further aviation redundancies and closures. In all, 733,000 jobs in, and connected to, Britain’s international and regional airports, are at risk from a prolonged downturn in air traffic. Much attention, naturally, is devoted to the airlines and air crews, and the retail brands whose revenues have been decimated. What’s often forgotten is the ancillary staff. Little mention is made of the support workers, among them the cleaners, mechanics, attendants, drivers, waiters and kitchen staff, who toil behind the scenes serving the airlines, caterers, hangars, stores, bars, restaurants, hotels, lounges and transport providers that make up a modern airport. And not just them, but the myriad small, medium and large enterprises that develop around an airport and count on it for business. In normal times, they all help sustain the local economy. Many of these jobs are low-skilled and pay low wages. Many of those who do them are from the younger and older age groups of the working population. Many too, are from BAME communities. They’re likely to have difficulty in finding suitable alternative employment. Hounslow commissioned a study from Oxford Economics on the cost to its economy from Heathrow’s slump. Its experts put the total at £1bn. That bill will be repeated, pro rata, at the other reeling aviation communities. It’s not just a financial loss – the air travel downturn is going to be reflected in increased social, health and mental health problems, and in crime. Hounslow has witnessed a 200% rise in domestic violence cases since the outbreak began. These, too, are places that are feeling the widespread ravages of Covid – their high streets are haemorrhaging, the same as elsewhere in Britain. This aviation crisis is not going to end immediately – air travel, the industry leaders are predicting, is not facing a quick bounce-back. Passenger volumes aren’t expected to return to their 2019 levels until 2023 at the earliest, while air freight is likely to take longer. These communities were facing uncertainty even before the advent of coronavirus. Environmental concerns were putting the brakes on airport expansion and future employment prospects. This is why, from Hounslow and Crawley, we’re coming together with the other affected areas to hold the first Aviation Communities Summit on Tuesday 24 November – to assess the economic and social harm, and to ask the government to establish an aviation communities fund to meet the immediate and longer-term needs. It is cross-party, non-political. At stake is the future wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of people. We must provide people with the skills so they can seek new opportunities. The different schemes aimed at apprenticeships and providing adult education programmes should, in the light of this unfolding disaster, be revisited, possibly consolidated and be made more relevant to future needs. The infrastructure provision in these areas should be reassessed and if required, rebalanced, to reflect the shifting economic landscape. We must focus on attracting new business, new investment, that’s not so dependent on aviation. None of this, we know, will be cheap. We are considering, therefore, exploring a funding mechanism, once air travel has recovered, that can be used to benefit communities in a major levelling-up initiative. These and other positive, proactive suggestions are what we – Britain’s communities that depend so much on our airports – would like to explore, starting with the unprecedented summit with the government and our stakeholders. • Cllr Steve Curran is the Labour leader of Hounslow council and Henry Smith is the Conservative MP for Crawley",2020-11-22 18:09:00+00:00,113246,2
113259,commentisfree/2020/nov/23/the-outlook-for-older-women-in-australia-is-dire-but-no-one-seem-to-care,Opinion,The outlook for older women in Australia is dire - but no one seem to care | Jane Caro,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/23/the-outlook-for-older-women-in-australia-is-dire-but-no-one-seem-to-care,"Every time I speak up publicly about the very real plight facing older women in Australia – as I did on last week’s Q&A - I get inundated with messages on social media. But virtually all of those messages are from other older women. They confide in me their terror of homelessness and the inescapability of their poverty. They tell me of the indignities and humiliations they suffer at the hands of a punitive and indifferent welfare system, and they whisper dark stories of domestic violence, neglected health and isolation. These women are my peers (I am 63). They are the girls I went to school with, my sisters, neighbours, cousins and friends. We all started out with the same hopes and optimism about our future but, for far too many women of my generation, those hopes have turned to ashes. Covid-19 has made everything worse in all sorts of ways, but it holds particular perils for those of us who are older. There are the losses that cannot be helped – the increase in isolation, the loss of contact with grandchildren and other relatives, and the need to take greater precautions when we venture out – but that is not the worst of it. Covid-19 has both unveiled and accelerated the discrimination and systemic burdens that make women more vulnerable to poverty throughout their lives. A vulnerability that snowballs as we age.
Prior to Covid, women over 55 were already the fastest growing group among the homeless. Research released in August estimated that 400,000 women over the age of 45 currently face this fate. Women who are in the private rental market, who are not employed full time and are a sole parent have a 64% risk of losing the roof over their head. If they have been homeless before, this risk increases to a staggering 83%! These figures are grim, but has anyone noticed? Is there an outcry? Does anyone – apart from the women themselves - actually care? Education used to be one of feminism’s good news stories. Australian women are among the best educated in the world. However, thanks to Covid, even this may be changing. There has been a drastic fall in university enrolments by women and girls – 86,000 fewer in 2020. That’s not just hopes, dreams and talent going up in smoke, that’s a lifetime of increased earning capacity lost. Male enrolments have fallen too, but at a far lower rate. No doubt female aspirations have not been helped by the federal government’s bizarre decision to price degrees popular with women students beyond reach. And, despite the rhetoric, many women who dreamt of studying the humanities haven’t gone into Stem. It seems many have given up the idea of attending university at all.
The recent budget, touted as all about jobs, did little or nothing to help. It did nothing to support women’s employment, despite women workers losing more hours of paid work than men. In September, the ABS estimated that 61% of all jobs lost since February were lost by women, and only a third of the jobs that have returned have gone to women. Lockdowns and working from home has seen many women experience a huge increase in their hours of unpaid work which, as it always does, impinges on their ability to return to full-time employment. When criticised for ignoring the plight of women in the recent budget, the government loftily claimed it was “gender-blind”, as if not noticing how much women were struggling was somehow a virtue. Not “seeing” women is one thing, but deliberate policy that hobbles the ability of women to enter and stay in the paid work force is quite another. The decision to make early childhood educators – overwhelmingly female and low paid – the first (and so far, only) group to lose jobkeeper support, seems designed to hurt working women. Not just those employed by childcare centres, but every person (mostly women) who relies on childcare to keep their job. The government also quickly reinstated the pre-Covid cost of childcare, already the fourth most expensive in the world, re-establishing yet another barrier stopping women returning to the workforce after they have had children, particularly full time. The decision to allow Australians early access to their super to help tide them over has also been particularly disastrous for women. They currently retire with an average of half the super of men and one third of women retire with no super at all. Industry experts are already sounding the alarm that this will condemn further generations of women to a poverty-stricken old age.
To spell it out for those at the back, this matters because if you are forced into casual, part-time, low-paid work – and women make up almost 70% of part-time workers in Australia – if you come in and out of the workforce due to caring and domestic duties, if you are the last hired and first fired after you turn 50, you accumulate less super. The sexism, discrimination and obstacles compound until, according to this year’s Measure for Measure Report, 60% of older single women (never married, divorced, widowed) rely on the full age pension and half of them live in permanent income poverty. In other words, your reward for a lifetime of putting other people’s needs ahead of your own is very likely an old age of poverty and sleeping rough. I don’t want to believe our government is using the pandemic to shove women, especially mothers, back into the kitchen and back into financial dependence of their husbands, I really don’t. But when you put it all together, it’s hard not to reach that conclusion. Whether this is part of an ideological belief that women should be at home, looking after the kids, or just an inability to see or care about the fate of 51% of the population, the long-term consequences for the current generation of women are dire. Whether they want to think about it or not, younger women are now facing at least as high a risk of a desperately poor old age as their mothers and grandmothers did. Not thanks to Covid, but thanks to government policy. Yet, according to polls, this is a very popular government, so I return to my opening question: why does no one seem to care? Surely we should be marching in the streets? Surely there should be daily questions in the House about why we are blithely casting our mothers, aunts and grandmothers (and soon, our sisters, daughters and wives) into penury as they age? Why is it the only people who seem to notice are older women themselves?",2020-11-22 16:30:27+00:00,113260,2

There could be no finer coda to this gruesome year than for it to be revealed that Parton had partly funded the research that led to the Moderna vaccine, currently topping the charts at 94.5% efficacy. In April, Parton donated $1m (£750,000) to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee. She discovered that this had gone towards funding the vaccine when the name of her foundation, the Dolly Parton Covid-19 Research Fund, surely the jolliest name for a scientific research body ever, appeared on the report. I have recommended this more times than I can remember, but for an in-depth insight to how Parton manages to appeal across almost every divide, the 2019 podcast Dolly Parton’s America is fascinating and vital. (In a vaccine/podcast crossover, the presenter is Jad Abumrad, whose father, Dr Naji Abumrad, is professor of surgery at Vanderbilt and a friend of Parton’s, who inspired her to donate the $1m.) It paints a portrait of a woman who is canny and kind, politically adept and preternaturally smart, and it goes a long way towards explaining why she is so loved by so many people, from all walks of life, in many countries. I find myself suspicious of those who claim not to like Parton or her music and suspect it is largely a contrary position to take for the sake of it, like not having a television or insisting that you enjoy the taste of mustard. “This could be your most significant contribution to the world yet,” Alex Jones told Parton on The One Show when discussing the vaccine news, which was a bold claim to make about the woman who wrote Jolene and I Will Always Love You in one sitting. “I’m sure many millions of dollars by many people went into that,” Parton pointed out, modestly, because she is Dolly Parton. Of course, everyone knows that Parton did not singlehandedly usher in the beginnings of the end of the pandemic, though frankly, if that were the news, I doubt it would be a massive surprise. But it feels somehow fitting and proper that Parton’s philanthropy, which has had a special focus on educating children from poorer backgrounds, has come through once again, this time when it was most needed, by the whole world. She plays an angel in her forthcoming festive film, Christmas on the Square, and who could take that away from her? Ant and Dec: an unerring ability to keep us laughing
There are more belly laughs to be had in five minutes of I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! than in most edgy new sitcoms. It’s not that contestants facing their phobias is inherently funny, though Radio 1’s Jordan North squealing about his “happy place” while trapped underground in a box did have its own charms. (Not for the snakes in there with him: the RSPCA has again criticised the show’s use of live animals.) It’s more that after 18 years, Ant and Dec continue to be the funniest hosts on TV. No wonder they win every annual presenting award going. Their banter has brightened up my week. In ordinary times, I find it hard to stick with shows such as I’m a Celebrity or Strictly Come Dancing because they require so much time and attention. It’s a commitment. But with little else to do in the evenings, at least little else that would require leaving the house, the entertainment they provide has been oddly comforting and communal, in a way that I did not anticipate it would be. I can join in with family texts, say, about who’s done what on which trial for the first time in years. The Great British Bake Off ends this week, but with that, Strictly and I’m a Celebrity, it feels as if the titans of UK light entertainment have really rolled up their sleeves and mucked in when it comes to doing their bit for the national mood. The opening episode of I’m a Celebrity was the most watched non-news programme of the year, with 12 million viewers tuning in at its peak. I am not at all surprised. Nigella Lawson: she makes even toast taste better
In one brief segment on her new cooking show, Nigella’s Cook, Eat, Repeat, Nigella Lawson changed my relationship with toast. That relationship is longstanding and devoted – I honestly think my death row meal would be a thick slice of hot buttery toast – but this second lockdown has taken it to the next level and I can only describe November as “carby”. (I read one “how to stay healthy this winter” article that advised steering clear of bread and pasta, which seemed, to my gluten-tolerant appetite, to be a straight path to misery.) Last Monday, Nigella showed us how she makes toast. (To be fair, “call this cooking?” naysayers, she did go on to make the bread.) She butters it once. She leaves it. Then she butters it again. Unsalted butter. Sea salt sprinkled on at the end. She called it a “platonic ideal of toast”. I felt oddly unplatonic towards it. Her televised method proved controversial, but the next morning I found myself looking at my own toast, buttered only once, with salted, thinking: should I? Could I? Reader, I did. It is a best-of-both-worlds slice of toast, hot and cold, to quote the great Katy Perry, and the double butter is here to stay. • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",2020-11-21 17:30:00+00:00,113422,2

But one person whose act of scientific generosity ought to be remembered is Zhang Yongzhen. The scientist, who works out of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, was the first to map the whole genome sequence of Sars-CoV-2. He did so on 5 January 2020 and hoped to share it with researchers by uploading his work to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The professor knew he was dealing with a deadly virus – but he had no idea how dangerous. The pathogen has killed more than 1.7 million people and shut down nations, leaving a trail of economic disruption. Concerned that the NCBI would take its time, the scientist sanctioned the sequence’s global public release via an Australian colleague. On 11 January, when Wuhan recorded its first Covid death, the virus’s genomic sequence was posted on an open access site. The 28,000 letters of Covid’s genetic code allowed Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, Moderna and BioNTech to design their vaccines in days. Testing took the rest of the year. To go from an unknown lethal new virus to an approved vaccine in months is a medical miracle. While the immediate sharing of data from a dangerous infectious disease might seem obvious, it goes against the grain of the way science has too often worked. A scientist’s ability to get funding and get ahead has for decades been predicated on competition, not just cooperation. Doing what is right rather than what one is told is made harder when operating in an authoritarian system like China’s. Prof Zhang received unwelcome official attention. His lab was closed down briefly before sense prevailed. Such episodes were used by Donald Trump, shamefully, to shift blame from his floundering response on to the nation where the pathogen was first identified. Prof Zhang’s work highlighted the need to be able to map viruses themselves, not just their spread. Sars-CoV-2’s evolution has been watched more closely in real time than any other virus in history. The UK’s genomic monitoring identified a highly transmissible Covid-19 variant in December. Such surveillance, with appropriate privacy safeguards, will probably go global. Scientific collaboration will need to be nurtured. By forging links across borders, scientists can provide a trusted early-warning system for global health and ultimately lower the risk of wayward politicians inhibiting progress.",2020-12-31 18:46:06+00:00,113541,2

Every vaccine given, every story of some friend’s elderly father or previously housebound great-aunt getting the call-up, is another small victory. One less potential victim for the virus. One more family spared a tragedy. Even the proposed handing out of “I’ve been vaccinated” stickers, like the ones dished out to small children for being brave at the dentist’s, seems only mildly toe-curling. It’s a lovely thing to hear that someone you know has been plucked to safety, like a shipwrecked sailor hauled on board a lifeboat. What’s wrong with spreading the joy?
Yet while this week’s long-awaited decision to approve the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is indisputably a breakthrough, it also takes us closer to a decision Boris Johnson cannot afford to get wrong. When Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked in parliament on Wednesday exactly how far down the vaccination priority list we have to get before restrictions could be lifted, he tap-danced around the question. But it isn’t going to go away. If all goes to plan, the over-80s and a fair few over-75s ought to have been vaccinated by February. So what happens when a critical mass of lockdown sceptics take that as their cue to start arguing it’s time for everyone to resume a normal life, no matter what the doctors say? We are headed, in other words, for a potentially dangerous moment in the politics of the pandemic. Already a handful of the usual rightwing suspects have spent the week noisily demanding that old and ill people be confined to their homes (sorry, “shielded”) so that everyone else can get on with merrily going to restaurants. With each older person vaccinated, they’ll redouble their demands to be set free, and the fact that they have been wrong at every other critical stage of the pandemic won’t stop them heaping scorn on anyone who disagrees. They will argue that with the vaccine beginning to shield the most vulnerable people, everyone else should now be trusted to make their own decisions. And as the economic damage done by a year of successive lockdowns mounts up, they may well carry more of the public with them. The last thing desperate people will want to hear is that it’s not that simple, even if it isn’t and never has been. Hancock hinted as much when he said that the timetable for lifting restrictions would depend on observation of transmission rates, as well as on the numbers who have or haven’t had the jab. Translation: even with a vaccine, the R number must still be low before we can all plunge back into crowded pubs, restaurants and theatres, throwing masks and caution to the wind. Even once the nation’s older people have all gone under the needle, rampant unchecked spread among those who are unvaccinated could still potentially be dangerous. Even 50-somethings can get sick enough with Covid to need intensive care – ask Boris Johnson – and if hospitals are sufficiently swamped that there are no ICU beds free at the time, then they can also die for lack of it. The threat posed to younger people by long Covid, the mysteriously disabling condition that for some can follow the virus, isn’t to be treated lightly either, given that we don’t yet understand what causes it or how to treat it. Nor do we know yet how long the protection offered by the vaccine lasts, or whether it stops people unwittingly spreading the virus, which is why the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, warned this week that even those who are newly vaccinated shouldn’t be behaving with “wild abandon” just yet. (Judging by the questions friends are starting to get asked by recently jabbed parents, that’s a message that has yet to cut through in some quarters). Yet still the prime minister sticks to his line that the war will be more or less over by April, sparking sunny headlines about freedom now being within our grasp. Given his previous prediction that it would be all over by Christmas, it would probably be wise not to make any ambitious plans for Easter. But there’s a risk here of failing to prepare people for the reality ahead.
Time and time again, this government has chosen not to level with the country about what may be coming, only to end up frantically raising the alarm at the last minute. It’s no way to convince even those trying to engage in good faith with their advice, let alone those with their fingers still jammed firmly in their ears, insisting things aren’t that bad even as hospitals start running out of oxygen. So here’s what ministers struggle to say out loud; that social distancing and all the disruption it brings to daily life is probably here to stay for longer than anyone wants to think, even if the harshest elements of lockdown can be lifted by spring. That the higher numbers climb this January, the longer it will take to get them down again, especially if the government remains allergic to the very idea of another national lockdown. That we can still look forward to gradually emerging from hibernation this spring, but that it could be 2022 before things are properly back to normal in Britain (and longer before that’s true globally). And, above all, that scrapping all the rules prematurely would be a terrible waste of both the sacrifices made so far and the gift science has given us. Vaccines have given us a precious chance, for once, to get ahead of this horrible virus. We owe it to those who have brought us this far not to fritter that chance away.

Still she flinches. NSW people “should” wear masks indoors, the premier said on Thursday. This is mandatory again in Victoria. There are few precautions more obvious and more readily adopted than mask wearing but the Berejiklian government simply “urges” it.
Melbourne grumpily waved the AFL grand final off to Brisbane. Sydney has been able to keep its new year third cricket Test, with some 24,000 on-ground spectators each day. It is difficult to reconcile how having more than five guests at home for a one-night party is Covid-dangerous but having some 120,000 watching the five days of a cricket Test is no problem. The premier says “if we need to re-evaluate some of our settings, update the compliance”, the Sydney Test might be abandoned. That seems unlikely. Such inconsistencies in the Berejiklian approach were not starkly relevant or were ignored while NSW appeared to be doing better than its neighbours. That has changed.
The virus in NSW now is in danger spots from Gosford to Wollongong, Katoomba to Cronulla. What the state’s health chief calls “a bit of a rollercoaster ride” is far from over. People from Sydney are not welcome in other states at the moment. One consequence is confirmation that the pandemic can shrivel political laurels as it can ravage human health. Berejiklian might be the next victim. It’s like a reverse Victoria. There is a growing questioning not of what NSW is doing but what it is not doing. Berejiklian says her priority is community safety and the NSW government ought be saluted for its preparations. It was able to mobilise mass testing with little notice, and health services and staff have been superb faced with this latest round of Covid-19 transmissions. The swiftness of the public response – close to 28,000 dutiful punters taking the trouble to be tested on the day to 8pm Wednesday night – was telling. It demonstrated a preparedness to accept tougher restrictions and precautions, measures Berejiklian held off from. Undoubtedly she cares deeply about the safety of vulnerable citizens but she has also made clear her determination to preserve business as usual, whatever the virus might be doing. The premier has been acclaimed a star by a cheer squad of political and economic observers who have condemned the actions of other leaders in their attempts to smother the virus. On 17 December Scott Morrison enthusiastically – and prematurely – pumped up praise for Covid-19 management in NSW. The prime minister told reporters: “NSW is the gold standard [of contact tracing]. I don’t spend too much time worrying about NSW.” Morrison’s lauding of his home Coalition state was a sneering shot at the Labor administrations of Victoria and Queensland where the virus was met by restrictions that shredded some lifestyles and businesses. It wasn’t merely a familiar bout of Morrison’s incautious political opportunism. As he explained with a mixture of relief and pleasure, an “open” NSW had prevented the economy, and his government’s economic management credentials, from crashing even further: “Where other states faltered, NSW stood very strong.”
That was then. Berejiklian might be forced to undo NSW’s rescue of the economy to escape the current chain of transmissions. She might have to be a north-of-the-Murray Daniel Andrews. On Thursday she acknowledged that not all premiers were fans of the Berejiklian approach. The premier is aware she has been seen by critics as the wimp of the virus fighters and seemed content with that, and her determination not to impose “burdens”. “I think it’s been evident during the course of the pandemic that every state leader, every territory leader, has had their own policies in place,” she told reporters in Sydney. “Every state and territory is different, every government is different. Here in New South Wales, we always try and strike the right balance. “This is a very unpredictable, contagious disease, but we also appreciate that we don’t want to put more burdens on our citizens than we need to. It’s a very fine line.” The policy of the flinch. • Malcolm Farr is a political journalist",2020-12-31 04:24:55+00:00,113657,2
113700,commentisfree/2020/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-responding-to-the-covid-19-surge-not-enough,Opinion,The Guardian view on responding to the Covid-19 surge: not enough | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-responding-to-the-covid-19-surge-not-enough,"The contrast between the good news and the bleak could not have been starker. The UK’s approval of the low-cost, highly efficacious Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine represents a shining moment of hope. Never has it been more needed. The announcement came as ambulances queued for hours outside overwhelmed hospitals in London and Birmingham, and Essex declared a major incident due to the pressure on health services. For a second day, more than 50,000 cases were recorded, along with 981 deaths. The number of hospitalised patients, at 23,771, has surpassed the first-wave peak and is almost certainly still rising; the impact of the reckless Christmas relaxation has yet to be felt. As grim as the picture is, it could soon become much worse: this is, as Professor Jonathan Van-Tam warned, a very dangerous situation. The acceleration of vaccination made possible by the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca product is essential to protect frontline medics. It offers a broader opportunity to escape the nightmarish cycle of delayed lockdowns, premature easing and resurging cases – if we are willing to seize it. It makes the case for the strongest action to restrict transmission more, rather than less, compelling. The extension of tier 4 to areas including Greater Manchester, the north-east, Midlands and south-west is a start – but still too timid. Tier 4 will now cover three-quarters of the English population, with almost everyone else in tier 3. The government appears to be edging towards a national lockdown when it should be implementing it now, as the group of experts calling themselves Independent Sage has urged. The reluctance may reflect Matt Hancock’s promise that MPs would have a vote on such measures “where possible”, and an unwillingness to spend any more to offset the inevitably punitive effects on local economies. But when areas in tier 4 are still seeing cases rise sharply, and an analysis by experts at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine has predicted that even weeks of tier 4 restrictions across the whole of England would not bring the R value below 1, it cannot stand. Delaying the return to school comes at an immense cost to the wellbeing of children, particularly poorer ones, as well as affecting the ability of their parents to work, with women bearing the brunt. The government said that it would prioritise keeping schools open. It did not. The result is that closing primaries in badly hit areas to most pupils for the next fortnight is necessary, especially given suggestions that the new variant may be more transmissible among children; it should have been done more broadly. Even if the mass-testing programme for secondary pupils goes smoothly, their return by 18 January (and for exam years by 11 January) is a hugely ambitious undertaking. Testing will have to be repeated weekly. Much more must be given to support online learning: the Department for Education’s performance in the first lockdown was dismal. The longer the government delays, the harder it will be to bring the virus back under control and the greater the price paid in lives and health – as the UK’s record to date demonstrates. Better by far to act swiftly and then relax measures if possible. A lockdown would also bring clarity when many are befuddled by constantly changing tiers, rules and advice. Decisive, timely measures are needed, clearly communicated to the public, and with explanations of why they are necessary and the provision of resources to allow people to comply. As welcome as the new vaccine is, scientists and medics can only help us if we help ourselves.",2020-12-30 18:58:05+00:00,113701,2
113761,commentisfree/2020/dec/30/coronavirus-screens-no-substitute-schools,Opinion,This year proved once and for all: screens are no substitute for real life | Ross Barkan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/coronavirus-screens-no-substitute-schools,"How we will ultimately remember the pandemic of 2020 is not yet known. Right now, it is the omnipotent crisis, dominating every waking moment. For those with any interest in the news, there are the daily death totals, surpassing those of 9/11, and reminders that a vaccine is here but not here, still many months away from ending this hell for good.
But a more deadly pandemic in 1918 and 1919 was largely lost to history, swallowed by the end of the first world war and the roaring 20s, the mass death hardly making a groove in the long-term psyche of the nation. The generation that lived through coronavirus may talk about it until they die or choose, like their ancestors in the early 20th century, to bury it away and focus on new horizons. Covid-19 has shown us, at least, what will be necessary and what we can absolutely do without. There are white-collar jobs that can be performed adequately from home. For some companies, large offices in central business districts are an extravagant waste of money. Hygiene, we hope, will change forever, with routine hand-washing and occasional mask-wearing in crowded areas becoming normalized in America. One hundred years ago, survivors of the flu pandemic learned about the importance of fresh air and proper ventilation, and this is a lesson we were forced, under horrific circumstances, to internalize anew. We learned, too, what it is we don’t want – a world utterly consumed by screens. Yes, we will maintain our smartphone addictions, and laptops and tablets will continue to consume much of our time inside our homes. The pandemic has boosted Zoom stock by 500%. For many of us, this has been 2020: one Zoom after another, human faces in little boxes. In the early months of the pandemic, there were Zoom birthday parties, Zoom cocktails, Zoom Easters and Zoom Passovers. The life we had lost needed to be approximated, as much as possible, by Zoomworld, forging connections and alleviating boredom. After a while, I didn’t want to Zoom any more. I’m sure I wasn’t alone. Each drifting gaze, faulty connection, and wistful joke about the time we’d all be indoors at the bar again was a reminder of what I had lost. As the year drifted on and I tried to navigate a world with such conflicting public health guidance, friend meet-ups sporadically scheduled, I knew that I never wanted to endure another social interaction on a screen again. It was reality flattened and condensed, drained of what it should be. The longer I spoke to the distant, pixelated face in front of me, the more I remembered that this facsimile of my prior life wasn’t anything close to what I wanted. Children had it worse. For years, tech maximalists had sold us a future of education-by-screen; why have physical classrooms at all? The internet offered unlimited possibility. Information was everywhere, easily summoned at a keystroke. Students of the 21st-century classroom would merely need lessons uploaded to their screens. A teacher only had to be a face trapped in a sleek tablet.
As we’ve learned, remote learning in public schools has been a disaster. Yawning inequality gaps have only been exacerbated, with the wealthiest students enjoying an in-person education at private schools while poorer students suffer in school districts that have sent many of them home. Not all students have functioning internet. Others live in chaotic households that make daily learning impossible. In December, families sued the state of California, alleging school districts failed to provide “basic educational equality” for children of color from low-income backgrounds during the pandemic. Rectifying this divide – universal broadband access is a worthy goal – would make remote learning more viable, but it is still a lackluster substitute for the socialization that comes with education in a physical classroom. Students make friends, learn from each other, and form crucial bonds with their teachers. Young children are in particular need of in-person learning. Adequate mental and emotional development can’t happen in isolation. Many people understood this before the pandemic. But for a long period of time, there were those that argued that more tech would bolster the education experience. To boost test scores – of course, big tech loved a lengthy standardized test – just pay for an interactive whiteboard in every classroom and shell out for individual tablets. Why was this better? Well, it was shiny and new. Higher education, long overpriced, faces its own post-pandemic reckoning, with many smaller schools threatened with closure. College students may find some educational functions can be performed remotely. Yet the MOOC revolution and online-only schools will not be able to supplant the surviving colleges and universities that prioritize in-person education. Few students that endured a year of Zoom classes will demand more of them when the pandemic ends. Professors, meanwhile, will be eager to resume life inside a classroom, where lively discussions and genuine learning can take place naturally without the mediator of a Zoom screen. The pandemic made it easy to imagine an approaching dystopia: one in which, in the coming years, we would all sequester ourselves away from light and air, too terrified to venture outdoors. Instead of heading to the bar or the gym, we would build worlds of our own within our four walls, content to approximate the reality we once knew. Instead, we rediscovered parks and trails, flocked to beaches, and revolutionized city streets with outdoor dining. We wearied of our devices. There is no app or program that can replicate a friend’s laughter across the table or a teacher’s lesson at the front of a classroom. After the pandemic, in a post-vaccination world, we will race back to our old lives. Zoomworld will belong to history.

113808,commentisfree/2020/dec/30/a-third-of-sydneys-covid-outbreak-is-outside-the-northern-beaches-its-time-to-mandate-masks,Opinion,A third of Sydney's Covid outbreak is outside the northern beaches. It's time to mandate masks | Catherine Bennett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/a-third-of-sydneys-covid-outbreak-is-outside-the-northern-beaches-its-time-to-mandate-masks,"Nearly 50 Covid-19 cases have now been reported across greater Sydney outside the northern beaches; a third of the 146 community transmission cases reported in New South Wales this month. Most, but not all, have been linked to northern beaches cases or venues. It is the “but not all” that really matters here, even more than the number of cases. If you can’t link all cases back to a known case, or at least a venue where an exposure event is known to have occurred, it’s a warning sign that you have unidentified cases out there in the community.
When thorough forensic case investigations – which NSW Health is now very experienced in – fail to identify transmission chains, it means there are cases out there who didn’t get tested, either ignoring their symptoms or who did not have symptoms. There are also those people’s other close contacts who may still be incubating the virus or may be infectious themselves and passing the virus on unknowingly. This is the time to mandate masks in shared public spaces where you cannot keep your distance, or any enclosed spaces when with people outside your household. Masks won’t stop you being exposed if you are unlucky enough to be at a venue where a case is present, but they will reduce your chances of developing an infection – while you may still need to go into quarantine for 14 days, at least all your close contacts won’t have to go through that too if you test negative as you start isolation. Consistent mask wearing actually makes it easier for health authorities to take those decisions that keep businesses and venues open in the face of known community transmission. It’s part of the essential partnership between the public, businesses and the public health response. Covid-safe compliance is another essential component, whether it’s record keeping and density compliance in a pub, or individuals remembering to hand sanitise and keep their physical distance. Masks should be part of this, given the evidence they work – they made a measurable difference to transmission rates in Melbourne when introduced midway through the second wave.
NSW has demonstrated impressive community engagement in testing, hitting nearly 70,000 tests completed on Christmas Eve. However, the numbers have drifted down since and are now well below 20,000. Potential exposure sites are still being added to the alert list daily, and it’s incredibly important that people keep an eye on this and seek testing if at one of these venues in the given time frame, and stay isolated until they get the result. The risk in the efficiency of the NSW Health venue notifications and the early public engagement is that infected people might be getting tested before they have enough viral load in the nose and throat to test positive. On average it takes five days from exposure to develop symptoms, but may be as little as one to two days before you are infectious and test positive. However, it can be much longer than that also, hence why we quarantine people for a full 14 days. People who tested within the first few days of being at one of these exposure sites/times should also think about re-testing after day 11 as they may have still have been incubating the virus the first time around, or test even sooner if any symptoms appear. Some measured easing of restrictions was put in place for Christmas across all areas in greater Sydney. That’s now one average incubation period ago, and so we expect to see cases linked to any gatherings an infectious person attended appear from now. We already see that with the six related cases in Sydney’s inner west, and with many more close contacts of this multiple household cluster in isolation.
Household settings are high risk for transmission. You do not want to bring the virus home. We hear a lot about superspreader events. These are dangerous as they accelerate case numbers by spreading the virus across many people at one time, but the main driver of the large case numbers that arise is that these primary contacts then take the virus home to many households. The people directly exposed at superspreader events are only a small proportion of the ultimate case number. Homes remain one of the highest risk locations for people to catch this virus. Visitors to Sydney have also returned home to other states earlier in December. So far this does not seem to have triggered any local community transmission further afield, but as we do not know the actual timing or means of the arrival of this overseas variant into Sydney, it is still possible that there are undetected cases outside greater Sydney. We should all therefore be mindful of how we spend our New Year’s Eve. There’s a lot we all want to celebrate about this year being over, but the more carefully we all do that, the more likely it is that our new year will look a whole lot better than the last. • Catherine Bennett is chair in epidemiology at Deakin University",2020-12-30 06:04:23+00:00,113809,2
113889,commentisfree/2020/dec/29/covid-theory-dangerous-health,Opinion,"Shield some and let others carry on? This Covid theory is dangerous, and foolish | Charlotte Summers",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/29/covid-theory-dangerous-health,"There is currently a discussion, relayed by media such as the Sun and MailOnline and circulated on social media, about the way Covid-19 predominantly impacts older people and those who have pre-existing health conditions. Some are advocating that those who are healthy and aged under 60 should not be subject to restrictions. There are several flaws in this narrative, from practical as well as ethical perspectives. It is correct that 388 people aged under 60 with no pre-existing health conditions have died from Covid in England. Similarly, “only” 1,591 Covid-related deaths have occurred in people without pre-existing health conditions who are aged 60 or older. The majority of deaths – 45,770 – have occurred in people with pre-existing health issues (3,210 of them in people below the age of 60). But what is meant by “pre-existing condition”? Included are things such as having had treatment for a mental health condition, having autism or other learning difficulties, asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic neurological disorders, chronic lung disease, dementia, diabetes, rheumatological disorders (types of arthritis and other joint conditions), and ischaemic heart disease (angina and heart attacks). I have asthma, along with about 7% of the population in England. Should I happen to die from Covid (which is unlikely), I will be classified as having a pre-existing condition. What’s more, health – and therefore the distribution of “pre-existing conditions” in society – is inextricably linked to wealth. Being poor means you are at increased risk of health conditions such as asthma and diabetes. Being poor decreases your life expectancy. The recently published Build Back Fairer: The Covid-19 Marmot Review highlights the link between deprivation and mortality from Covid-19 and other health conditions – the more deprived the local authority in which you live, the higher the mortality. The best explanation of this I have seen is from Dr Mike Ryan, an executive director at the World Health Organization: “It is not just Covid-19 that is killing people, it is under-privilege, it is lack of access [to healthcare], it is years of living with health conditions that haven’t been properly managed because of the colour of your skin, or your ethnicity, or your social group.” Suggesting that the young and the healthy should be able to live their lives unhindered by restrictions reduces social responsibility for Britain’s health inequality and draws a distinction between “them” (the poor and the at-risk) and “us”. We have little chance of eradicating Covid-19 (or many other infectious diseases) or preventing the next pandemic unless we take the issue of health inequality seriously. The argument often made, citing mortality statistics for those without underlying health conditions, is that the economy will be ruined unless some are free to return to “normal”. It is not that simple. Society is interconnected, and our individual actions have an impact on others. Going to a pub or a restaurant requires people to serve the food and drink; others to supply the goods we consume; cleaners; and a host of other roles, many of which are occupations at increased risk of mortality from Covid. The concept of “focused protection” is not new and was proposed by the authors of the highly criticised Great Barrington declaration. They suggested: “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.” The problem is, even if we accept this idea (I don’t), it is not feasible. How do we keep about 15 million people (the estimated number of people in England with a chronic health condition) away from the virus, look after them in a Covid-safe manner, and keep society running? It would be near-impossible. Would they need to live separately from their families? Who would ensure they were fed and cared for during their isolation? Chris Whitty was correct to describe this approach as “flawed and operationally impractical”. Accepting that we cannot protect millions of at-risk people from Covid, any virus circulating in the low-risk groups will rapidly transfer to those who will require healthcare when sick. If a health system (this is not an NHS-specific issue, as was seen in New York) becomes overwhelmed, it cannot provide healthcare for anyone. Reducing the transmission of the virus protects us all, whether we have pre-existing health conditions or not. If there is less Covid, the health system is more able to treat non-Covid illnesses to which we are all susceptible. Death is not the only Covid outcome that matters, to individuals or the economy. The Office for National Statistics estimates that there are currently about 186,000 people living in households in England with symptoms relating to Covid that have persisted for five to 12 weeks: one in 10 people has symptoms 12 weeks after infection. Although preliminary, the data also hints that patients who were hospitalised with Covid may have increased rates of new diagnoses of serious cardiac, kidney and lung conditions, as well as diabetes. We still have much to learn about this new disease. In the end, either everyone’s health matters or no one matters. Where do we draw the line? The narrative of “them” and “us” is a dangerous one, and the idea that Covid-19 will not impact us all is foolish.

113962,commentisfree/2020/dec/29/us-uk-covid-sars-vietnam-senegal-ebola,Opinion,The UK and the US need to learn from countries that better handled Covid-19  | Laura Spinney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/29/us-uk-covid-sars-vietnam-senegal-ebola,"In October 2019, in those halcyon pre-Covid-19 days, a chart was published that ranked 195 countries according to their capacity to deal with outbreaks of infectious disease. Drawn up by the Washington DC-based Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland, the 2019 Global Health Security Index (GHSI) placed the US and UK first and second, respectively. South Korea came ninth, New Zealand 35th and China 51st, while a number of African countries brought up the rear. Well, that was droll. Either the authors of the chart got their colour key inside out or our definition of health security needs an overhaul – and given all the fancy data visualisation software available these days it’s unlikely to be the former. Of course, the pandemic is not over. But back in March, when the index was already looking about as accurate as a 2016 US election poll, Johns Hopkins health policy analyst Sarah Dalglish wrote in the Lancet: “The pandemic has given the lie to the notion that expertise is concentrated in, or at least best channelled by, legacy powers and historically rich states.” And she hasn’t changed her view. Many factors contribute to good epidemic management, but perhaps what the sorry fate of the GHSI teaches us is that while many of them are measurable – disease surveillance arrangements, emergency response plans, intensive care unit capacity – some are more ephemeral, or hard to discern until the chips are down. And yet good leadership, public trust in government and experts, and a sense of solidarity also powerfully shape a population’s vulnerability to infectious disease. You may also need a dose of luck, such that all these things align in the moment, but that’s no reason to stint on praise for the countries that have come through well. Each one took different weapons into the fight: Vietnam is relatively poor but learned lessons from the 2003 epidemic of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and now has a world-beating epidemiological workforce; Senegal is even poorer but, remembering Ebola in 2014, used travel restrictions and testing well; New Zealand was untouched by both Ebola and Sars (apart from a single probable case of the latter) but had the competent and charismatic Jacinda Ardern in charge. One thing the leaders of all these countries have in common is that they know an outbreak can grow exponentially, and that their best hope of containing Covid-19 was therefore to act fast and in a coordinated, data-driven manner. In a sense, each government sacrificed its population’s present for its future, but only because it understood that the sooner the sacrifice was made, the smaller it would be. They spared themselves agonising dilemmas down the line, such as whether to let the elderly residents of care homes die of Covid-19 or loneliness, or what to do about the generation of young adults facing mass unemployment. The ones that did best knew that offering support to those hit hardest by the containment measures would require a much smaller investment than would be required to stimulate recovery if they didn’t put those measures in place. In contrast, the wealthy countries that topped the GHSI sacrificed their future for their present, arguing as US president Donald Trump did that the cure must not be worse than the disease, or in UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s immortal phrase, that “Our country is a freedom-loving country” – to which the only possible response is this line from Albert Camus’ The Plague: “They fancied themselves free, and no one will ever be free so long as there are pestilences.” Thinking back now on how these leaders failed, when according to a colourful chart they had so much going for them, it’s hard not to be reminded of the marshmallow experiment. If you aren’t familiar with this classic test of a child’s ability to delay gratification, watch this YouTube video posted by the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail. Four preschoolers do their best not to scoff a marshmallow left alone with them for 15 minutes, because they’ve been promised two if they pull it off. The marshmallows look pretty soggy and dog-eared by the end, but they survive the encounter and the children get their reward. Encouraged by their leaders, the US and UK chose instant gratification instead, and will now pay the price. Luckily, societies have built-in counterweights to such present bias – ways of investing in the future that they call research and education. Though both have suffered this year, the fact that they have a long investment horizon means that previous generations’ efforts have tided us over. Hence a pandemic that for 11 long months has felt ancient, because our only shield against it was the age-old one of social distancing, suddenly slipped through a wormhole and became postmodern. The Covid-19 vaccines that have recently been approved mark a technological watershed – one from which the world is unlikely to look back. Those vaccines offer us the possibility of herd immunity and a return to something approaching normality – but only if enough people take them. Unless governments make them compulsory for some or all of the population – which hopefully won’t be necessary – this will be an individual decision, which means our collective future lies in every individual’s hands. Getting in line for a dose seems like a no-brainer, given that our regulators have deemed the vaccines to be safe and effective, and not only our future but potentially that of the next generation is riding on them. At any rate, we are the ones staring down the marshmallow now. Once the pandemic has receded, there will be lessons to digest and implement. One of them is that experts should be treated once again with the respect they deserve. They are, after all, the dividend of our investment in research and education – our guides to the future. They should be allowed to disagree, to say they don’t know, to fail, as all human beings occasionally do. But we should keep them on their toes too, and point out their blindspots, because it’s not really droll that more than 300,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 to date, or that, when judging by deaths per million of the population, the UK is the ninth most lethal country in the world at the time of writing. It’s a tragedy of dimensions that would have been literally inconceivable a little over a year ago, when the GHSI was published. Key to preventing any recurrence is understanding why that coloured chart got it so wrong, because hindsight is all very well but it should at least sing for its supper. As Dalglish pointed out, 85% of global health organisations are headquartered in Europe or North America, and half of all global health leaders are UK or US nationals. The community of experts that seeks to protect us from future pandemics needs to open up to Vietnam, Senegal, China, New Zealand and all the other countries that learned from their diverse past experiences, and learned well – in many cases, with fewer resources. It may seem like another no-brainer, but global health should be truly global. This article was amended on 3 January 2020. An earlier version said that the UK had the sixth highest number of deaths in the world. Although the statistic was correct, when judging by deaths per million of the population the UK is the ninth most lethal country in the world, which provides a better reflection of the relative impact of Covid-19.

I savour this time with my family and friends – celebrations of generosity, love, and my many communities. It is usually a chance to reflect on another busy year, and to anticipate the coming one with hope and optimism. This year, however, December feels very different. I don’t think I’m my normal self, and I know that many of my colleagues in the health professions feel the same way.
After months battling the worst pandemic this country has seen in living memory, many of us are finally coming to terms with a fatigue that will not be sorted out by a good night’s sleep. We have been in a state of constant alert for the entire year. While it seems so long ago, this year began with face masks for reasons other than a pandemic. Smoke, destruction and massive bushfires left many with scars. If the blackened skies, devastated communities and horrific air pollution levels were the only health crisis of 2020, they still would have made the history books. But then, a virus called Sars-CoV-2 made its presence known in Australia. In the past, I would often be speaking for the medical profession in this country. But after a year when “teamwork” has become the most important word in my professional life, I feel the need to speak for the entire spectrum of healthcare workers. I pay tribute to their brilliance this year. We have endured so much together in 2020, and we now share a bond that will never be severed.
Of all the challenges healthcare workers have faced this year, a constant theme has weighed upon us. Uncertainty. When would the pandemic hit? Would Australia go the way of many nations, and see hospitals overwhelmed? How would we treat our patients when they became desperately ill, and their oxygen saturation dropped to levels we usually associate with cardiac arrest? How could we protect ourselves, our colleagues and our families, knowing how infectious this virus appeared to be? Would a Covid vaccine ever be developed, and how long would it take? For some of us, there was always one question that lingered more than any other. When the wave arrives, and the patients start being wheeled through the ambulance bay doors, would I be equal to the task? Fast forward nine months, and many of those questions now have answers. We have all faced some degree of lockdown, isolation from loved ones, and been prevented from working, travelling and studying in ways we used to take for granted. More than 28,000 Australians have been infected, and 908 of them have died. Among the dead, the frail elderly have borne the brunt of the pandemic. Many have died in aged care settings, as well as in hospitals. So many died separated from their loved ones, only able to hear their voices on the phone or see their faces on a screen – that will remain with me long after this pandemic is over. Thousands of healthcare workers contracted Covid-19, 3,573 in Victoria alone. Despite the best efforts of many, and a very steep learning curve, our safety has never been fully assured. While I dodged the bullet and was a close contact in isolation early on, many of my colleagues weren’t so lucky. Some ended up as patients in their own hospitals; some required intensive care. Time will tell how many develop chronic illness – so-called “long Covid”– with unknown implications for their professional and personal lives.
Australia has done well by world standards in combatting this pandemic. But if you lived through the second wave in Victoria, you would be entitled to think differently. The long months from July to October were bitter and painful in Melbourne. Caring for so many of the sick behind face shields, masks and gowns has traumatised many of us. But we have much for which we can be proud and grateful. Melbourne healthcare workers soldiered on despite high infection rates, long hours, staff shortages and little chance for a break. Melburnians stayed the course. They followed the expert advice, contained the virus, and protected the rest of Australia. All the while, the kindness shown towards healthcare workers touched us all, and made things a little easier. Looking back, eliminating community transmission in Victoria is a remarkable and unique achievement. And yet, mental health presentations have skyrocketed – showing that the pandemic is not yet finished with us. News from around the world is heartbreaking, and all we can do is offer support from a safe distance. As this painful year draws to a close, Australia is tempted to congratulate itself on doing much better than most of the world. But even as I write, Sydney is contending with a new outbreak. The rest of the nation watches on anxiously – particularly those of us who have seen the impact when an Australian city loses control of the virus. Safe, effective vaccines are on the verge of approval and mass production. The need for PPE at work in most of the country is declining. The last Covid case I treated was over two months ago. Adversity is the greatest teacher, and there are so many lessons to learn. But right now, all I can think about are a few weeks off with the people I love.

114050,commentisfree/2020/dec/28/covid-vaccine-uk-restrictions-independent-sage,Opinion,"With the new Covid variant everywhere, it's not enough to just wait for the vaccine | Stephen Reicher",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/28/covid-vaccine-uk-restrictions-independent-sage,"The new variants of Covid-19 have changed the nature of the pandemic. We are no longer facing the same situation as in March or even November. Our response must change accordingly. It is now clear that variant B117 of Covid-19 is already established in all parts of the UK. Being an estimated 56% more transmissible than pre-existing variants, it is likely to constitute 90% of all cases by mid-January. According to UK government briefings, even current tier 4 restrictions are insufficient to deal with its spread. Indeed, no single measure is likely to be sufficient to bring the pandemic back under control. Rather we need an integrated response that brings together all the instruments we have to deal with the infection. How do we do this? My colleagues and I on Independent Sage are proposing a five-point emergency plan, which would allow the UK to start 2021 with a comprehensive strategy in place to deal with the crisis. All five parts of the plan must happen in concert and they need to be accompanied by a comprehensive communications campaign. First, there’s the question of vaccination. The rollout of vaccines is a key part of the strategy to combat Covid-19 and must be accelerated as a matter of urgency. This should be organised through the over 8,000 GP practices in the UK, supported through additional staff and resources, and coordinated via local public health structures. However, vaccination cannot be the entire strategy. This is because of the time taken to complete it (that’s even if we reach the target of 2 million vaccinations a week called for by members of the government’s influenza modelling group), uncertainties over its duration of immunity and impact on transmission, and restrictions on its use in some populations (eg children, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers). All this is exacerbated by the fact that, due to the increased infectiousness of the new variant, a higher proportion of people need to be vaccinated in order to achieve population immunity. In the medium term there will be pockets of the population in which the infection continues to circulate, with periodic outbreaks inevitable. Vaccination can complement but not supplant other interventions.
This takes us to the second point: national control measures are essential. Further restrictions are necessary in two main areas. The first of these is personal travel, especially international travel. This must be monitored and regulated effectively, with advance application for travel to and from the UK, a negative PCR test prior to travel and managed isolation on arrival. The second area is education. Schools should remain closed until buildings are made as safe as possible for pupils and staff. This includes smaller class sizes (achieved through hiring extra teachers and teaching rooms), adequate ventilation and free masks for all pupils. Universities should move to online teaching as the default until Easter at least. This will allow students to study from home, avoiding issues arising from travel and crowded campus accommodation. For school, college and university students, there should be universal provision of computers and wifi connections to ensure everyone can study remotely. Schoolchildren without space for home study should be taught along with vulnerable children and children of key workers. Our third point in the plan is about the UK’s test, trace and isolate regime. Throughout the pandemic, the government has reduced the issue of a testing system to the numbers of people who are tested. However, testing is only the first step in the process. It must be part of a strategy designed to trace contacts as quickly as possible so as to isolate them before they can infect others. This requires not only forwards tracing (identifying who you might have given the infection to) but also backwards tracing (where you got it from). The government’s contracting out of the test and trace system has shown the private sector is not up to the job – and nor can it be. Effective tracing and supported isolation depend upon local public health staff who know their patch and are trusted by the community. The need for a “public health reset” of the testing system remains urgent. Practical support is necessary in order to enable people to self-isolate. The continued failure to address this issue in the UK has led to continued low adherence (less than 20% for those with symptoms) and contrasts markedly with the 90-95% rates achieved in places like New York, which supports isolation with everything from financial assistance and hotel accommodation to pet care. Next, workplaces. When the government relaxed restrictions in July, they handed over responsibility to employers and owners of facilities to make their premises safe but with limited guidance, minimal support, and virtually no formal regulation. While many enterprises have worked assiduously to ensure that adequate Covid mitigations are implemented, this is not true of all. It is now critical to ensure that we have robust systems to prevent the spread of infection. This should include funds for necessary changes, inspection of all premises and certification of those meeting the required standards. This would have the added advantage of increasing public confidence in using certified premises (shops, hospitality etc). Finally, financial support for the public is crucial. Inequalities are playing a central role in this pandemic. The disease impacts more on vulnerable populations as do the measures used to control it. People on low incomes are more likely to lose jobs and suffer financially than the more affluent, many of whom have profited from this pandemic. The firm measures we propose here are both morally and practically untenable without enhanced support for individuals and local businesses that will be affected most. At a time when the UK (population 67 million, Covid deaths 70,752) has been experiencing more than 30,000 new cases a day and prevaricating about what measures are needed, Australia (population 25 million, Covid deaths 909) instituted immediate and far-reaching restrictions in Sydney after an “outbreak” of 38 cases. One local person responded by saying: “Let’s go early, let’s go hard and let’s get this baby.” This makes a good mantra for the pandemic as a whole. Our plan is a minimum for what needs to be implemented – without delay. Stephen Reicher is a professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of Independent Sage.

114180,commentisfree/2020/dec/27/the-guardian-view-on-britain-out-of-the-eu-a-treasure-island-for-rentiers,Opinion,The Guardian view on Britain out of the EU: a treasure island for rentiers | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/the-guardian-view-on-britain-out-of-the-eu-a-treasure-island-for-rentiers,"When the UK entered the coronavirus age in March, state resources and collective commitment were mobilised on a scale not seen since the second world war. Decades ago, Britain had revealed itself, thanks in part to being able to marshal the industrial might of the empire, to be a formidable world power. Its economy was energised with breakthroughs in radar, atomic power and medicine. Although the story of the pandemic has not yet ended, there appears to be no such transformation in sight under Boris Johnson. Rather depressingly, familiar trends of greed, incompetence and cronyism are reasserting themselves. This is bad news for an economy where there has been a collapse of socially useful innovation. Britain’s lack of hi-tech manufacturing capabilities, notably in medical diagnostic testing, was cruelly exposed by the pandemic. This country has become more of a procurer than a producer of technology. But it is a remarkably inefficient one – despite an extraordinarily high percentage of lawyers and accountants in the working population. Connections seem to matter more than inventions. How else to explain why, in the desperate scramble to procure personal protective equipment, ventilators and coronavirus tests, billions of pounds of contracts have gone to companies either run by friends or supporters – even neighbours – of Conservative politicians, or with no prior expertise. History is not short of examples where political insiders were successful in extracting virtually all the surplus that the economy created. Such influential interests moulded politics to enlarge their share of the pie. Greed was limited only by the need to let the producers survive. The shock of war, revolution, famine or plague provides an opportunity to fix a broken society. But if, post-pandemic, UK politicians care less about reform than the retention of power, they will fail to restrain the grasping enrichment that undermines democracy itself. Windfall profits Perhaps the most penetrating X-ray of this phenomenon today is by Brett Christophers in his book Rentier Capitalism. The academic makes the case that Britain has become a treasure island for those seeking excess profits from state-sanctioned control of natural resources, property, financial assets and intellectual property. Rent, paid by renters to rentiers, is tied to the ownership or control of such assets, made scarce under conditions of limited or no competition. Mr Christophers says that the first sign of this new order was when Britain struck black gold in the North Sea. He writes that MPs on the public accounts committee noted with incredulity in 1972 that “the first huge areas of the sea were leased to the companies as generously as though Britain were a gullible Sheikhdom”. After that, public assets were sold off cheaply. The private sector ended up controlling lightly regulated monopolies in gas, water and electric supply, and public transport and telecoms. Customers lost out, overpaying for poor service. In a rentier’s paradise, windfall profits abound. Brazenly occupying the lowest moral ground was essential, as the housebuilder Persimmon proved by earning supersized state-backed help-to-buy profits long enough to hand out a £75m bonus to its boss. The banks, which took this country to the brink of collapse a decade ago, are at the heart of a rentier state. France, Germany, Japan, the US all have banking sectors smaller than the UK. While banks earning rents have flourished, the households paying them – either directly as financial consumers, or indirectly as taxpayers of a debtor state or customers of debtor firms – have floundered. The anger that such spivvery engenders is diffused politically by making voters complicit in the theft. The sell-off of council homes, says Mr Christophers, was a privatisation that gave many of those perhaps most inclined to kick against Thatcherism a personal stake in the project. Culturally, Brexit plays the same sort of role as the right to buy, insulating poorer leave voters from the idea that they will suffer from the resulting policies. The prime minister understands that Covid can change Britain, but lacks modernising policies. He extols the virtues of free competition – both for itself and because such freedom, he reasons, will somehow liberate the spirit fluttering within a pre-Brexit Britain caged by coronavirus. He is no doubt betting that the disruption of leaving the EU will be lost in the roar of an economy taking off as an inoculated population returns to offices and shops. Weakened regulations The gap between rich and poor in the UK is at least as high today, academics calculate, as it was just before the start of the second world war. This is largely because the British state that once mediated the struggle between labour and capital has been taken over by rentiers. Weakening regulations, reducing the importance of fiscal policy and shredding social protections has corroded liberal democracy in which an increasingly influential wealthy few have been enjoying a free run. Ultimately, rentiers want to increase what the economist Michał Kalecki called the “degree of monopoly” in an economy. This allows them to limit the ability of workers, consumers and regulators to influence the markup of selling prices over costs and to defend the share of wages in output. The EU says its labour, environment and customer protections are a floor, not a ceiling, and that they can’t be traded away for frictionless market access. If we had stayed in the club, our ability to concentrate profits for monopolists would have been stymied in future trade deals negotiated by Brussels and open to MEPs’ scrutiny. Outside the EU, Mr Johnson can barter away such regulations – without parliamentary oversight – and scrap safeguards in new technology for higher monopoly profits. Karl Marx wrote in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte in 1852 that “the Tories in England long fancied that they were in raptures about royalty, the church and the beauties of the ancient constitution, until a time of trial tore from them the confession that they were only in raptures about rent”. His assessment of early 19th-century Tories applies with unerring accuracy to today’s Conservatives. Mr Christophers’ insight is that the Tories under Mr Johnson are a party of – and for – rentiers, much more than the interests of productive capital. This explains why, after 2016, the Tory party embraced Brexit and shrugged off productive capital’s concerns about leaving the EU. It will be to the great detriment of this country if the pandemic permitted Mr Johnson to combine present-day fears with a yearning for hopeful change to persuade the average person to vote against their interests in the future. But history often repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce.",2020-12-27 15:23:43+00:00,114181,67
114189,commentisfree/2020/dec/27/consultant-infectious-diseases-long-covid-not-mild-illness-seriously-debilitated-new-clinics,Opinion,I'm a consultant in infectious diseases. 'Long Covid' is anything but a mild illness | Joanna Herman,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/consultant-infectious-diseases-long-covid-not-mild-illness-seriously-debilitated-new-clinics,"With the excitement of the Covid vaccine’s arrival, it may be easy to forget and ignore those of us with “long Covid”, who are struggling to reclaim our previous, pre-viral lives and continue to live with debilitating symptoms. Even when the NHS has managed the herculean task of vaccinating the nation, Covid-19 and the new mutant variants of the virus will continue to circulate, leaving more people at risk of long Covid. Data from a King’s College London study in September suggested as many as 60,000 people in the UK could be affected, but the latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics suggest it could be much higher. I was acutely ill in March, though – like many people with long Covid – mine was defined as a “mild” case not requiring admission to hospital. Nine months on, I am seriously debilitated, with crashing post-exertional fatigue, often associated with chest pains. On bad days, my brain feels like it doesn’t want to function, even a conversation can be too much. I have no risk factors, I’m in my 50s, and have always been fit, but remain too unwell to work – ironically as a consultant in infectious diseases. Watching the pandemic unfold from the sidelines when I should have been working in the thick of it has only added to the frustration of my protracted illness. My acute symptoms were over within 12 days, and I presumed I’d be back at work the following week. How wrong I was. In the following weeks I developed dramatic hair loss (similar to that post pregnancy) and continued to feel fatigued, usually falling asleep in the afternoon. I tried to steadily increase the amount I was exercising – but suddenly in mid-June I started to experience severe post-exertional fatigue. It could happen on a short walk or it could be while cooking dinner. It was completely unpredictable. When I felt really terrible, I would get chest pains, which I’d not had during my initial illness, and my body seems to need intense rest – and a lot of it. Graded exercise, an approach that has been used to manage patients with other post-viral fatigue, wasn’t working; in fact it seemed to be detrimental and could leave me floored for days. The one thing I realised early on was that pacing was vital.
For months it seemed there was no recognition of what was happening to so many of us, with numerous anecdotal reports of people being dismissed as anxious, depressed or histrionic. It felt as if we had been left in limbo, not followed up because we weren’t ill enough initially to be treated in hospital, but most without appropriate medical care and support for the duration of their illness. I am fortunate to have an excellent GP who has been extremely supportive throughout, but I could hear her frustration at the lack of anything concrete to offer or refer me to. In May, with no resource to turn to, I set up a long Covid yoga group (I am also a yoga teacher) for others I knew who were similarly affected. I focused on particular exercises to help them relearn how to access their lungs and breathe again. Much about this novel virus remains unknown, and we are all learning as the pandemic continues to unfold. With its myriad symptoms and presentations, Covid represents a major challenge to the compartmentalised specialist services that hospitals have become. But one thing has been evident for some time: this is not a straightforward post-viral syndrome, and requires a different approach. The announcement in October of £10m funding for clinics offering help for long Covid couldn’t have come soon enough. And then the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) updated guidance on “post-Covid syndrome” (as long Covid will now be known), including a definition, as well as plans for the 40 clinics across England. These clinics will bring physicians and therapists together to “provide joined-up care for physical and mental health”, and will include physical, cognitive and psychological assessment. I am yet to be seen by a physiotherapist, but who’d have thought the perching stool sourced by an occupational therapist for my elderly mother would become a necessity for me to cook dinner and brush my teeth?
There will also be allocated funding from the National Institute for Health Research for much-needed investigations into the mechanisms behind the long Covid symptoms. It is vital that long Covid is quantified and monitored in the same way we have been doing for hospital admissions and deaths. Additionally, there must be easy access to social services for people who need a care package because they can’t feed or wash themselves, as well as financial support and employment advice. Crucially, like many multi-disciplinary teams for chronic conditions, there should be a single point of contact with a nurse specialist who coordinates different team members, and helps direct access to other services. A comprehensive one-stop shop is vital for people who can’t manage multiple visits to different specialists. It may be enough for some that they are simply listened to, and it is understood that they are not fabricating their symptoms. We also need to cease classifying all cases that were not admitted to hospital as “mild”. Those experiencing long Covid have anything but a mild disease. At last it seems that those of us with this debilitating condition are gaining the recognition and support we have been crying out for. We are only just acknowledging the potential of this virus to have devastating and life-changing consequences months after the acute symptoms. That at least is a good start.

114204,commentisfree/2020/dec/27/america-healthcare-system-coronavirus-covid-long-haul,Opinion,America's healthcare system will struggle to deal with Covid 'long-haulers' | Jennifer Lutz and Richard Carmona,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/america-healthcare-system-coronavirus-covid-long-haul,"Post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) isn’t new, but that won’t stop Covid “long-haul” syndrome from toppling an already unsteady medical system. The symptoms faced by so-called long-haulers – Covid patients who don’t seem to fully recover, even months after infection – can be debilitating. Understanding the similarity of long-haul syndrome to previous outbreaks (as well as the differences) should advise an incoming administration on the need for massive healthcare reform.
Post-viral fatigue syndrome has followed many viral outbreaks, such as the Spanish Flu of 1918, the 2002 SARS-CoV, the 2009 influenza, and the Ebola outbreak of 2014 – to name a few. PVFS is also frequently linked to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can cause infectious mononucleosis (mono, sometimes called the “kissing disease”). Similar to Covid-19, EBV may present with no symptoms – especially in children – but it has been linked to the triggering of autoimmune disorders. The threat of long-haul syndrome isn’t its novelty, but rather its history. Post-viral fatigue is often categorized with (and sometimes becomes) chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), an illness that effects women at four times the rate as men and still eludes effective treatment. Current reports estimate that at least 10% of people reportedly infected with Covid-19 have gone on to develop long-haulers syndrome. As of Thanksgiving, the United States will have surpassed 12m cases of Covid. At 10%, we can anticipate a heavy addition to the already staggering rate of chronic illness in the US; if our healthcare system doesn’t adapt, it will likely fail. What exactly is long-haulers syndrome? It’s too early to know. As of now, the phrase is a catch-all diagnosis. It appears that long haulers can be divided into two main groups: those who experience physical damage to their organs, and those who exhibit symptoms without clear physical explanation. The latter is most similar to classic PVFS, and the former seems to be a consequence of Covid’s function as a vascular disease – novel for a respiratory virus. As a vascular disease, the widespread inflammation caused by the immune response to Covid can inflame the inner lining of endothelial cells, which line our blood vessels. Simultaneously, when the virus enters the cells via the ACE2 receptors, it can cause exocytosis – basically, causing the cells’ guts to spill out, which further increases systematic inflammation. The vascular injury triggers wide-spread clotting, which may explain many of the seemingly weird and unrelated symptoms of acute Covid. This circular reaction may have long term consequences, such as tissue damage and scarring. Whether the injury is obvious, or not, both groups of long-haulers can suffer long-term damage to the lungs, heart, brain and immune system. It’s not uncommon for a virus to trigger autoimmunity when there is a predisposition. An overactive immune response (such as that seen in Covid) can cause self-antigens to attack a person’s own body. Autoimmune conditions such as diabetes, systematic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease and multiple sclerosis have all been linked to a viral stimulus. We are also seeing low-grade systematic inflammation in patients who recover from Covid-19. Systematic inflammation has been linked to chronic fatigue, autoimmunity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and obesity, among others. The NIH estimates that 8% of the US population has an autoimmune disease. The national obesity rate is above 40%. Diabetes affects more than 10.5% of the population. In other words, the US already has a chronically ill population – and Covid-19 is only going to make that worse. Economically speaking, preventable chronic diseases account for nearly 75% of aggregate healthcare spending in the US, or an estimated $5,300 per person annually, according to the CDC. Six in 10 adults in the US have at least one chronic disease; four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. We have long been an unwell nation, even before Covid-19. If anything, Covid long-haul syndrome shines a necessary spotlight on the United States’ chronic problem.
The current health care model doesn’t work. There needs to be more emphasis on lifestyle interventions with a broader understanding of integrative practice. The goal of these prevention strategies is to help Americans live longer, live healthier, and live cheaper. Simply put, preventative healthcare saves money and lives. For instance, researchers have recently discovered that type 2 diabetes can be reversed with early intervention. Headway has been made in treating multiple sclerosis and lupus with immune treatments, as well as with diet and exercise. Almost all chronic diseases are preventable by integrative practices and early intervention. It must also be noted that chronic illness affects mental health, which manifests physically, increasing the risk for diabetes, sleep disorders, chronic pain, and heart disease, among others. Simultaneously, health care must be made more accessible – including preventative healthcare, which can no longer be considered as an add-on to traditional care. We know that some communities of color experience chronic illness at overwhelmingly higher rates. We know that autoimmunity affects women at strikingly higher rates than men. We know that chronic illness disproportionately affects those in lower socioeconomic groups. Health must not be a privilege of wealth, whiteness, and gender. The cost is too great. Currently, we are in the acute stage of a crippling pandemic caused by an invisible pathogen. Layered on top of that is a second pandemic, the mental health costs of this virus. Then there is a third layer: a hyper-partisan political climate, which exacerbates the first two. When a medical mask becomes a sign of political division, we are in grave danger.

114331,commentisfree/2020/dec/26/ten-reasons-we-got-covid-19-vaccines-so-quickly-without-cutting-corners,Opinion,Ten reasons why we got Covid-19 vaccines so quickly without 'cutting corners' | Adam Finn,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/26/ten-reasons-we-got-covid-19-vaccines-so-quickly-without-cutting-corners,"The speed at which effective Covid-19 vaccines have come through to authorisation has caused surprise. Compared with previous vaccines, the process has been very fast and so, naturally, people are asking how can it have happened without some kind of compromise on standards and care. Explaining it all as simply a result of the wonders of the latest scientific advances seems vague. So how has it actually come about? In reality, there are at least 10 reasons: some are about good planning, some good science and some just good luck. 1. Pandemic plans were already in place Long before the Covid-19 crisis, there was an awareness that a pandemic of some sort was likely in the coming years and plans had already been made to tackle it. Governments, international agencies and foundations had been pooling resources. The international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in 2017, and when Covid-19 arrived they were ready. In addition, several companies and academic institutions, notably including BioNTech, Moderna and the University of Oxford, had also been working on new technologies capable of generating vaccines from the genetic codes of infectious pathogens and cancers, and testing them for several years. 2. China identified a novel coronavirus early on Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang at Fudan University, Shanghai, and colleagues in China quickly obtained material from an early case of Covid-19 and identified a novel coronavirus. They elucidated the genetic sequence of the RNA in the virus very quickly and made the information public. That fired the starting gun for vaccine production. The fact that the RNA and viral vector vaccine platforms needed only the nucleotide sequence of the virus (the genetic code used by all living things from viruses to whales to reproduce themselves – in effect a series of letters you could send as a text message), and not a sample of the actual virus, allowed design and manufacture to happen very fast. 3. Substantial funding was granted immediately The vaccine developers had access to immediate and substantial funding. Normally, getting money to develop new vaccines takes time: either you have to persuade grant-funding agencies or charities and their advisers – who are often your competitors – that your ideas are sound, or, if you are a company, you have to persuade your own directors or external funders to invest. With the health and economic costs of the pandemic so great, funders enabled all plausible options, while CEPI was also ready to support the most promising proposals immediately. 4. The clinical trials process was speeded up The processes of writing clinical trial protocols and getting the necessary approvals to carry them out was speeded up. This usually evolves very slowly – ethics committees and regulators have to fit them into long queues of proposals. But this time researchers were working and meeting at all hours and extra personnel were drafted in. Committees received applications, prioritised them and made decisions usually within 24 hours. Everyone redoubled their efforts to put these studies first. 5. Vaccine trials started straightaway Experienced vaccine teams were swiftly able to run Covid-19 vaccine trials. In the UK, there were already four centres ready to start the Oxford vaccine study immediately and, through the National Institute for Health Research, which coordinates all clinical trials done by the NHS, an additional 14 sites were identified and set up for the larger phase 2-3 studies that followed. 6. Research data was collected electronically Information technology was readily available and made use of. Clinical trials have been slow to embrace electronic methods of data recording and collection for fear of glitches. Paper records are familiar, solid objects that everyone can see and believe in, but they are slow and error-prone. Where other sectors have led, research has now finally followed. When you buy an airline ticket, you do it online and the form does not allow you to make mistakes or omit important pieces of information before you complete a purchase. Such characteristics are also vital for data collection and, during the three to five years prior to this pandemic, research trials have been switching to this approach, with data collected straight into computers and tablets in the clinic. Mistakes and omissions are rare. Information is immediately available for analysis even as it is being collected. 7. Studies attracted a huge number of volunteers There is massive public support for, and engagement with, these studies. Many people wanted to take part and help out. Typically, vaccine trials take weeks or months to recruit, but for these studies – assisted by the speed of media information, social media and the ability of subjects to register interest instantly online – it was possible to identify willing volunteers within just a few hours. Without the participants the studies could not happen. 8. Trials have yielded rapid results For results, there need to be cases of disease. Even with all this speed, large-scale trials only got going towards the end or after the first wave of Covid-19 cases in most countries. While low rates of disease during the summer in many places was great news for our health, sanity and the economy, it actually made the trials more difficult. If you have large numbers of people who have had vaccine or control injections, in order to find out whether the vaccine works you need cases of Covid-19 to occur. You hope the cases will mostly be among the controls. But if no one gets sick you are none the wiser. The arrival of the second wave is a massive public health challenge, but it has enabled these trials to yield results rapidly. 9. Early vaccines worked well It’s much quicker to get a result on a vaccine that works well than one that only works feebly. Even a vaccine that only prevents a small proportion of cases could be useful in the context of a pandemic, but it takes longer to find out whether a weaker effect is really there. If a vaccine were 100% effective (no such vaccine exists but just for the sake of argument) then you might only need about 20 cases of disease in your study – which would all occur among the controls – to be almost certain that the vaccine caused the imbalance of 20 sick controls and no sick vaccinated people. But if the vaccine was only moderately effective, 20 cases would not be nearly enough. Seven cases in vaccine recipients and 13 in controls could be due to vaccine-induced protection, but could also easily be chance and a vaccine having no effect at all. You would want many more cases – for example, 70 to 130 – to be more sure of your result. But getting 10 times more cases would take much longer. The fact that the early vaccines have worked well has made it quicker to be much more certain about the strength of their protective effects. 10. Regulation took place while the studies were continuing Using “rolling review”, a completely different approach was taken to regulatory approval this time. Normally all the trial results and data are prepared in a massive package once the studies are finished, a process taking months. The whole lot is then presented to the regulators, which are the agencies that issue licences for drugs and vaccines, and they then begin their review, another process taking months. This time the data was provided to the regulatory agencies as they were being generated and was being reviewed while the studies were ongoing. When the final results came in, those were the only results left to be reviewed. The whole process took months, but the last steps took only days. Authorisation is not the end of this “fast vaccines” story. Rollout and administration of vaccines began almost immediately. That isn’t normal either. No sensible company would start manufacturing vaccine until it knew it would definitely be allowed to sell it, but this time the manufacturing was done at risk and in advance. If the vaccines had failed, all of the doses already made would have had to have been scrapped. Fortunately, that has not happened. There are more vaccines in the pipeline and we have more to learn about the ones that have arrived – much more information about safety and side-effects will accumulate as they are given to far larger numbers. But the fact we are already in a position to start protecting vulnerable and the highly exposed people by immunisation is the result of foresight, hard work and some lucky breaks.

114444,commentisfree/2020/dec/25/covid-19-good-health-biology-pandemic-unequal-effects,Opinion,Covid-19 has shown us that health is not just down to biology | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/covid-19-good-health-biology-pandemic-unequal-effects,"If you wanted to run an experiment on Earth to understand human behaviour, the pandemic would be the perfect opportunity. In some people, the virus that causes Covid-19 has no symptoms. In others it leads to deadly disease. The virus pits the healthy against those with underlying health issues, and the young against the old. Infectious diseases can bind us together or drive us apart. Low-income countries know this too well; many face multiple outbreaks of infectious diseases each year. But richer countries such as Britain are still painfully learning that a virus doesn’t just attack the human body: it holds up a mirror to national weaknesses and runs havoc across society and the economy. Across the world, the pandemic has resulted in a perverse “Hunger Games”, where countries have competed in mortality rate league tables while also trying to save their economies and cope with successive waves of this disease. In February and March, European governments chased down limited PPE stocks, ventilators, oxygen, out-of-stock reagents for their labs, and experimental steroids and drugs. The US was accused of stealing ventilators from Barbados, PPE from Germany and it bought up the rights to remdesivir, limiting the supply available to other countries. At the World Health Assembly in May, governments committed to sharing research products and working collectively to address Covid-19. But when governments were faced with tough decisions about how to share resources, their promises of cooperation broke down.
The pandemic has been a test of our self-interest, both as individuals and as nations. One of the key questions has been what responsibility richer countries owe towards poorer nations, particularly when it comes to ensuring the equitable distribution of a vaccine. Earlier this year, 171 countries pledged to take part in the Covax initiative, which aims to support the development and equitable distribution of 2bn vaccine doses before the end of 2021. But when the first vaccine proved successful, manufactured by Pfizer and BioNTech, richer countries bought up 80% of its doses. In fact, one analysis by Oxfam found that even if all five of the most advanced vaccine candidates succeed, there would not be enough vaccine for most of the world’s people until 2022. This has always been the case in global health: whoever pays the highest price acquires the research products. The World Health Organization has actively tried to warn against this nationalistic approach, but in the end, words and pledges don’t amount to anything unless they are followed by action. It’s money and power that counts. The same questions about selfishness can be asked of our commitment to each other at home. What responsibility does each of us have towards our communities? The pandemic has divided families, friends and neighbours over whether they’re willing to bend the rules to accommodate individual wishes, or make sacrifices with others in mind. The mixed reaction to summer holidays reflected this, as some people decided to travel to other countries, with the risk of transporting the virus with them, while others stayed put. In some schools, entire bubbles of children were sent home to isolate because one student in the bubble had been on holiday abroad and their parents had decided not to follow the 14-day quarantine rule. Families have been split over the question of Christmas celebrations; whether it’s sensible to host multiple families at one gathering, or wait to delay festivities until the spring or summer when a mass vaccination programme is in motion. On many occasions, the virus has forced us to decide how comfortable we each are with particular risks, and to reevaluate others according to their own risk threshold. We may have become closer to some families who share our thinking, and distanced ourselves from others who have different approaches to the pandemic. In comparing our pre- and post-Covid selves, we’re perhaps at risk of overstating how much the pandemic has changed us: instead, it has simply shown each of us who we really are. There were many bright moments of selflessness in 2020. Many people made huge personal sacrifices – none more so than the health workers who put their own lives at risk to treat patients needing care. Because of their occupation, healthcare workers are seven times more likely to get severe Covid-19 than other workers, and many turned up to work on wards in March and April without adequate PPE, ready to accept whatever came their way. Elsewhere, bus drivers, security guards, social care workers, cleaners, grocery store workers, mutual aid groups, and teachers all put the needs of running society above their own health and welfare. If anything this pandemic should give us cause to reflect who adds value to society and whether we are compensating these roles appropriately.
On the other hand, time and time again in Britain, we’ve seen that it is one rule for some people (the wealthy and powerful) and another rule for others (the rest of us). The government created a loophole in quarantine restrictions that allowed “high value” business travellers to skip the mandatory 14-day isolation period when arriving into the country. Celebrities have hosted private parties while the rest of us have avoided social gatherings and seeing our family and friends. Most memorable of all, the prime minister’s then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, breached Covid rules but remained in his post. Of all the lessons we’ve learned from this pandemic, the most significant is how unequal its effects have been. Wealth, it turns out, is the best shielding strategy from Covid-19. As poorer people crowded together in cramped housing, the rich escaped to their country retreats. Two of the largest risk factors for dying from Covid-19 are being from a deprived background and being from a minority-ethnic background, pointing to the underlying role of social inequalities, housing conditions and occupation. Our society’s recovery from this disease should be centred on building more equal, resilient societies, where people in all parts of the world have access to both protection from the disease and access to research developments. It all starts with government. At the end of a gruelling 11 months, I’m left with Abraham Lincoln’s words in my mind: the pandemic has shown that we need “government of the people, by the people, for the people” – not just government for the wealthy elite. Perhaps that’s the strongest legacy of Covid-19. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2020-12-25 13:00:47+00:00,114445,2
114463,commentisfree/2020/dec/25/scientists-covid-studies-vaccine-2020,Opinion,How did scientists tackle Covid so quickly? Because they pulled together | Charlotte Summers,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/scientists-covid-studies-vaccine-2020,"The raw numbers around Covid-19 are simply incredible when you consider that this was a disease almost no one had heard of in December 2019. At the time of writing, this year about 240,000 people in the UK have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, and more than 70,000 people have had Covid-19 listed as a cause of death on their death certificate. I began 2020 anxious about the reports emerging from Wuhan: they seemed to imply an asymptomatic transmission of a respiratory pathogen that was serious enough to put sufferers into intensive care units. I am a clinical academic with specialist training in respiratory and intensive care medicine; I also lead a research programme that focusses on the lung inflammation caused respiratory infections – to me, and others, what was being reported looked like serious trouble. In response to the emergence of Sars-CoV-2, a World Health Organization clinical characterisation study was activated on 17 January 2020, in time for the first wave of patients with Covid-19 being admitted to hospitals in England and Wales. This observational study of patients was first established in 2013 to ensure the necessary infrastructure would be available to learn about rapidly spreading novel respiratory infections when needed. The first confirmed patient with Covid-19 in the UK was reported on 31 January 2020. By early February, it was clear there was a serious problem, and the ICU where I work began preparing for what might come our way. We held our first multidisciplinary meeting to discuss how we would manage the emerging threat, with colleagues from public health, virology, microbiology and others all joining us on 12 February. At this point there had been 10 reported cases of Sars-CoV-2 in the UK. Things progressed rapidly, and March was a frantic month for the UK response to the emerging pandemic. There was concern that the situation may become so bad the UK would run out of vital equipment such as mechanical ventilators, resulting in the government launching the Ventilator Challenge, to seek out, approve and manufacture the apparatus from a wide variety of sources. Much has been written about this process, but I am certain it was needed – I wouldn’t have agreed to help the endeavour were I not. March also saw the launch of the Recovery trial. It is testament to the responsiveness of the UK research system in the face of the pandemic that by 17 March, the trial had been devised, received ethical and regulatory approval, and was ready to start recruiting patients. Since then, more than 20,000 people have participated to help us understand which therapies work for hospitalised patients with Covid-19 – a phenomenal achievement. By April we were at the peak of wave one of the pandemic, and ICUs in many areas were under significant strain. On 12 April, there were 3,301 people with Covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation in the UK. Thankfully, by August this number had reduced to fewer than 70. However, by the end of October, it had once again climbed above 1,000, where it has remained, and currently shows little sign of abating. It is clear that Covid-19 is far from done with us yet. In the autumn, data emerged suggesting that what many thought would be near-impossible had actually been achieved – multiple effective vaccines against Sars-CoV-2 had been developed in under 12 months. December 2020 has seen the beginning of what will be a massive UK vaccination programme starting with 50 NHS hospitals. Such a tumultuous and difficult period prompts you to reconsider the events and your role in them. Something in particular I have learned this year: prior to 2020, I had never written a newspaper article, appeared on TV, or even spoken to a journalist about my work. I am embarrassed to admit, I had failed to appreciate the importance of communicating science to a wider audience. The torrent of noise and misinformation during the pandemic changed my view, and persuaded me to begin trying to these explain issues more clearly. It is not always easy to grasp, but we need to plainly state why specialist healthcare staff (and not bed) availability matters, and why we need both therapies and vaccines for Covid-19 to be available to everyone, among many other issues. This year has also reinforced my view that to build global, national and local healthcare resilience requires long-term commitment and planning. For the NHS, this means we need to ensure we have the appropriate specialist staff, equipment and other infrastructure to cope with the storms that we may face – with the coronavirus and beyond. No one can honestly say the UK has sailed through 2020 without having to make hard choices and compromises we would rather not have faced – the impact of the pandemic on the provision of healthcare for people with non-Covid conditions has been, and continues to be, significant. On many occasions this year, clinicians, patients, families, policymakers and politicians have all faced having to choose the least bad option under difficult circumstances. No one has been immune to the strain of this. Most of the “wins” this year have come from preparedness and collaboration. One example of this is the amazing contribution of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to the UK’s pandemic response. It has allowed us to rapidly learn about Covid-19 by supporting recruitment to observational studies such as Isaric-4C (the WHO Covid-19 study described above), React (a Covid-19 home-testing study), and GenoMICC (a global initiative to understand critical ilness), and has offered many thousands of people the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of therapies and vaccines. This work has helped to change clinical practice across the world by delivering important research. As we head towards 2021, I once again find myself anxious about what the new year might hold. However, I am convinced that preparedness, flexibility and a commitment to collaboration are what is needed to weather the storms that we may face in the coming months and years. • Dr Charlotte Summers is a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge",2020-12-25 10:00:43+00:00,114464,2

This aspect of our role really comes into its own when a new, devastating disease rears its head. We estimate that the new coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 first made the leap to humans last December. Over one and a half million lives have been lost in the past year as a result. Dealing with Covid has undoubtedly left its mark on the field – my field – and it seems like a good time to take stock. Right now I am sitting opposite my Christmas tree, the cat beside me, and I can’t help thinking that swooning over That Plot from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine briefing (page 58 if you are interested) is probably a phenomenon restricted to viral immunologists. But if this year has taught us anything, it’s not to make assumptions. And sure enough, I’ve seen it shared on social media by non-scientists as a symbol of hope. It’s been quite the journey to get to that graph. In March we were asked to go home, shut down our labs and think of things for our students and staff to do. It was unclear whether many of them would be eligible for furlough. Research students had to teach themselves new skills, trying their hand at programming languages and science writing. Masters students switched to “dry” projects, forgoing the coveted lab experience that is often the main point of an expensive MRes degree.
Postdocs, who are on contracts, entered a new era of uncertainty. Universities were forced to implement hiring freezes and funding bodies deferred or cancelled grant schemes. Academics with clinical backgrounds went back to frontline duties, their research stagnating but, thankfully, their salaries secure. Nevertheless, their risk of catching a new dangerous disease increased, and PPE was in short supply. Non-clinicians were seriously worried about how student recruitment would affect universities’ income and their job security by association. It was clear that there would be tough times ahead. At the same time as all this insecurity, there was a buzz of intellectual excitement in viral immunology: a new virus, an unknown entity. We had so many questions! We consumed preprints – a version of a scientific paper that precedes peer review – with a desperate thirst. It takes months to put a scientific paper through peer review, but preprints share the data immediately for all to see and can help shape the next steps in disease prevention and treatment. Immunologists worked with journalists to evaluate and interpret new findings on a daily basis, and this has increased the public’s trust in science. I fangirled over my viral immunology heroes as they appeared on broadcast media and in the popular press, dispelling misinformation and flying the flag for evidence-based medicine. In 1663, the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge was formed under the motto Nullius in verba, which can be glossed as “take nobody’s word for it”. Back then, fellows met at the society’s premises to promote and defend their research under the harsh questioning of their peers. In 2020, however, we had lockdowns. One of the best parts of my job is travelling to meet with scientists, learning about their discoveries and forging relationships that lead us down new and fruitful paths. Scientists know no borders, and being stuck at home during the pandemic has hindered the emergence of new collaborations. On the other hand, we took to meeting remotely like ducks to water; immunologists are now equipped to attend a seminar presented by a colleague from the other side of the planet, while feeding their children lunch and moving the laundry to the dryer. Caring responsibilities while working from home have given rise to hilarious memes, but have also caused a huge amount of stress, and it is estimated that women have and will be disproportionately affected. The resulting decrease in productivity is likely to impact women’s career progression in the years following the pandemic, and scientists and funders are looking for solutions. The economic after-effects of the pandemic will hold back research in some areas of immunology for years to come, because so much discovery science relies on funding from charities that are currently in dire straits. On the other hand, governments have diverted resources to coronavirus projects to cope with the new healthcare challenges. Academics have collaborated with industry to speed up vaccine development and drug discovery, and expensive clinical trials have experienced no trouble getting support. As a result, the first Covid-19 vaccine was rolled out less than a year from the discovery of the virus, and there are plenty more to come. The pandemic has acted as a proof-of-concept test for the idea that investing in scientific discovery is crucial for humanity’s health and economic prosperity. If we put money into science and work together, we can take on global challenges with resounding success. For example, we are now laying the foundations of the infrastructure needed to deploy vaccines globally, and we will be able to use this to target diseases other than coronavirus with prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination. This will include autoimmune diseases and cancer as well. I don’t need to tell you that it’s been a terrible year in terms of human suffering. But I take comfort from the fact that it’s also been a year that proved how powerful not just immunology, but science as a whole, can be. • Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer in viral immunology at the Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham",2020-12-24 12:00:17+00:00,114558,2
114672,commentisfree/2020/dec/23/blaming-public-rise-covid-press-ministers,Opinion,Blaming the public for a rise in Covid lets the government off the hook  | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/blaming-public-rise-covid-press-ministers,"It takes effort to imagine how the government could have mishandled the pandemic more disastrously than it has, yet people are blaming the crisis on themselves. For those who wish to hold our authorities to account for one of the worst death tolls in the world, polls offer bleak reading. According to a recent YouGov survey, over half of people think the public are “most responsible for the rise in coronavirus cases over the last month”, with just 31% blaming the people running the country . It is doubtful that the respondents are blaming themselves as individuals. Most would argue they have made huge sacrifices to avoid the spread of Covid-19, which is true. No, they are blaming a nefarious “other”, the ne’er-do-wells down the road, for an imagined failure of personal responsibility. Without stirring the pot of generational warfare, it is worth noting that, while the young tend to blame the government, pensioners overwhelmingly blame the “public”, by which they are likely to mean their grandchildren’s cohort, who are in reality sacrificing some of the best moments of their lives to keep their elders safe. Philosophically, the findings suggest many people hold a dim view of their fellow citizens. Those who support the Conservatives – the party most likely to wrap itself in the flag and denounce the left for doing Britain down – are most likely to damn the public for the steep rise in Covid cases. Presumably they believe that Germans, South Koreans, Australians and New Zealanders have a superior national character to the reckless Brits, rather than governments that did not lock down too late, prematurely reopen the economy without a functioning test-and-trace system and allow the constant re-importing of the virus through a lack of border checks. But why have so many come to this conclusion, when government mismanagement is a far more evidenced explanation for Britain’s startling death rate? Undoubtedly, four decades of prevailing dogma that attributes everything wrong in society – poverty, unemployment – to failures of personal responsibility, rather than structural injustices fuelled by government inaction, is partly to blame. This idea has allowed the Conservative government and the rightwing press to shift responsibility on to the public. There has been no effective strategy to push back on “Operation Blame the Public” – indeed, the broadcast media has largely amplified it – and so it has settled as a consensus among swathes of the electorate. This week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, told Radio 4’s Today programme: “The government has consistently this year been ahead of the curve in terms of proactive decisions on coronavirus.” This was such a profound inversion of reality that the interviewer should have treated it as a barefaced lie and shot back with some of the many examples of government delays and ineptitude we’ve seen during the pandemic. That Patel felt able to make such a wantonly dishonest statement in the first place underlines how confident she is that the government can get away with it, just as the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, got away with blaming the public for the second national lockdown in November, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, got away with blaming the public for Covid test shortages, and Johnson got away with reprimanding the public for “too many breaches” of the restrictions. The press has often amplified these efforts to shame the public, by publishing photographs of a crowded park during the first lockdown, for example, often deceptively shot to disguise social distancing. Rather than serially documenting government failures, BBC political correspondents sympathetically highlight that the “crisis is unprecedented as an administrative nightmare for every government around the world”, adding “it hasn’t happened before, so no one can be sure of the right thing to do”. Poor old ministers, is the not-so-subtle line of argument. But the official opposition must also accept some responsibility. Labour wasn’t in an easy situation: when a national crisis takes hold, many people adopt a mentality of “don’t attack the pilot when the plane is crashing”. The party deserves credit for forcing the government to U-turn on the NHS surcharge, and calling for a second lockdown. But Labour’s early failure to vigorously challenge the government’s numerous mistakes was a missed opportunity that allowed a feeling of exemption to take hold, as if any government would make similar mistakes given the circumstances. This explains why, even though the government has quite literally cancelled Christmas for millions at the last minute, one new poll shows the Tories still ahead. The truth is the public have abided by restrictions far better than they were predicted to do by behavioural scientists, who initially argued against imposing harsh restrictions on the grounds that most would not be able to observe such authoritarian rules for long periods. Yet people’s sacrifices prevented a far worse national calamity, and polling has consistently shown that the public were ahead of the curve in demanding tough new controls before the government implemented them. But with a formidable rightwing machine deflecting responsibility from our rulers to the general populace, and no determined effort to challenge it, the public continue to blame each other, and our government is set to get away with causing the biggest peacetime catastrophe in modern history.

114707,commentisfree/2020/dec/23/covid-mutating-eliminate-virus-eradicate-variants,Opinion,"With Covid mutating, it's clearer than ever that we must eliminate this virus | Devi Sridhar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/covid-mutating-eliminate-virus-eradicate-variants,"An emotional rollercoaster is probably the best way to describe the past few weeks. The UK government has lurched from allowing Christmas bubbles to cancelling Christmas altogether. Weeks after an effective vaccine was approved, the virus turned a new corner. Some have argued the new mutation is nothing to worry about – viruses mutate all the time. Others think it’s cause for panic. The truth lies somewhere in between. With limited information available about the new variant, the lesson from 2020 is to move early and enforce precautions rather than wait for things to unfold. When the government delayed a lockdown in the spring that would have reduced the death rate, Britain learned the hard way that it’s better to prevent an emerging disaster than to wait and watch. As Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, put it: if you see a train speeding towards you, do you wait to see if you get hit, or quickly react to avert the crash? Scientists are concerned about three aspects of this variant in particular. First, does it spread faster, therefore making suppression harder? According to Nervtag (the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group), the Covid variant that seems to have emerged in the south-east of England is up to 70% more transmissible. There’s also a concern that this variant spreads more easily among children (although there is no hard evidence for this). Until now, younger children haven’t transmitted to the same extent as older children and adults; if their infectivity increases as a result of the variant, there will be a new set of challenges about how to safely reopen schools in the new year. But just because the virus spreads faster does not mean that it has worse health outcomes. Nor is there evidence that it results in a higher rate of hospitalisation for those testing positive. Moreover, although many have asked whether the variant could present challenges for the Covid vaccine, or evade our natural immune responses, scientists are optimistic that our vaccines will still work. It’s also likely that, with the technology now available to produce successful Covid vaccines, scientists could tweak the vaccine in response to changes in the variant. Despite the fear and uncertainty surrounding this new situation, there are still reasons to be positive. Few would have predicted that we’d have at least three effective and safe vaccines against Covid-19 by the end of 2020. The Pfizer vaccine is already being rolled out in the UK; Moderna’s vaccine has been approved in the United States; and the AstraZeneca vaccine is not far behind. We now have PCR testing, rapid lateral flow tests that can give results within minutes, antibody testing and therapeutics that mean survival rates today are much better than they were a few months ago. While we know these vaccines can stop severe symptoms in those infected with Covid-19, we don’t yet know whether they can also stop vaccinated people being infectious to others. Neither do we know how long vaccines will provide protection for, nor whether governments should prepare for yearly vaccination projects for their entire populations, as they do with flu. Building herd immunity will require vaccinating 80-90% of the population – a huge task, even in normal times. The larger problem is that this is a virus that likes to jump across species. It did this in Denmark, jumping from humans to mink and back again. The more the virus circulates, the more likely it is that mutations and variants will emerge, making it harder to suppress. The responsibility for this new variant can partly be attributed to those who argued against restrictions, believing that allowing the virus to run rampant in young people while shielding the vulnerable would allow immunity to develop. What they didn’t foresee is that such conditions are ripe for variants to emerge. Unless we suppress the virus, it will probably mutate further. This could make our current vaccines ineffective, or lead to reinfections. Now more than ever, it’s clear why we need a proactive strategy to eliminate Covid altogether. The government has often delayed and dithered, reacting to outbreaks rather than seeking to prevent them. The flight bans imposed by other European countries show that, while the UK may be hesitant at suspending international travel, other countries are perfectly willing to act to control the spread of the variant. It’s no longer enough to just flatten the curve, or treat Covid-19 like a yearly flu. This will devastate our economy and society and run down our health services. The model of living with the virus and allowing it to run through the population has failed. Even Sweden, once hailed by some as an example of how to avoid harsh measures, has been hamstrung by outbreaks, run out of hospital beds and asked its Scandinavian neighbours for help. What does this mean for all of us now? While scientists continue to assemble the data and advise governments on how best to proceed, we should each be focusing on how to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others, and learning sustainable ways to live under restrictions for the dark winter months ahead. Quite simply: avoid indoor, poorly ventilated and crowded settings; don’t go into other people’s homes; keep your distance; meet outside; wear face coverings on public transport and in shops; and err on the side of caution. Ignore those who say Covid-19 isn’t a big deal or suggest easy solutions and silver bullets. Just because the government guidance permits behaviour that is irresponsible, and enforcement may be lax, doesn’t mean it is safe. In the absence of strong and effective leadership, we’ve all been placed in a position of individual responsibility: take care of yourself, your loved ones and your community, and remember that, while older and vulnerable people are most at risk of dying, younger people can also get seriously ill. Now is not the time to play Russian roulette with your health. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2020-12-23 14:36:24+00:00,114708,2
114744,commentisfree/2020/dec/23/travel-bans-effective-new-covid-variant,Opinion,Travel bans aren't an effective response to the new Covid variant | Angela Rasmussen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/travel-bans-effective-new-covid-variant,"By now we all know a new variant of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been detected in the UK and is spreading rapidly. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, announced that the variant, called B.1.1.7, is up to 70% more transmissible based on modelling studies. B.1.1.7 caused many infections in south-east England in a short period of time, rapidly displacing other circulating variants. Patients infected with B.1.1.7 also had higher viral loads. While this is certainly concerning, and warrants urgent scientific investigation, data supporting that this variant alone is driving the associated increase in cases is preliminary and inconclusive. Nonetheless, politicians began implementing sweeping policies right away. Multiple countries have imposed travel bans, greatly reducing travel from the UK or blocking it entirely. France closed its borders to most freight transport. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, called on the US government to impose numerous restrictions, including banning travel from Europe. He later settled for mandatory rapid testing for all travellers on US-bound flights from the UK. Given the high prevalence of all variants of Sars-CoV-2, including in the UK and many countries abroad, imposing onerous travel restrictions alone is unlikely to make a significant impact in the overall pandemic. Furthermore, they may be too late. The B.1.1.7 variant has been reported in other European countries, as well as in Australia. These policies appear to be based more on the fear of variants with unknown properties rather than the actual data, and are due to a persistent and fundamental misunderstanding of viruses and how they evolve and change when spreading through a population. Genetic mutation, the process that drives all evolutionary adaptation, is normal and expected, particularly for viruses. Every time the virus copies its genetic material – called its genome – it can make a mistake. If that mistake isn’t corrected, it will be copied the next time the virus replicates its genome. Mutations occur by chance, but if they happen to occur in a critical place and give the virus an advantage that allows it to outcompete other viral variants, they are said to be under positive evolutionary selection. For example, mutations in the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, which allows the virus to enter and infect cells, can be selected for if they make the virus more efficient at establishing an infection. We can probably expect to see other variants that may be more effective at spreading, causing disease or circumventing our immune responses. We must be prepared to respond in an informed and thoughtful way, rather than reactively. Unfortunately, because Sars-CoV-2 is spreading so widely, the virus has many opportunities to develop mutations that give it a competitive advantage. The only way to stop the virus from mutating is to take away its ability to replicate, which means drastically reducing community transmission. Mutations do not automatically make a virus a more exceptional pathogen. The advantages conferred by positively selected viral mutations are good for the virus, but aren’t necessarily always bad for the human host. Many mutations can make the virus better at infecting cells, replicating, or transmitting to new hosts, but will have no effect on the severity or type of disease that they cause. In the case of B.1.1.7, there is fortunately no indication that the 23 mutations distinguishing the variant result in more severe Covid-19. The claim that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible is based on primarily epidemiological evidence and data on increased viral loads, and is compelling but far from decisive. To demonstrate conclusively that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible, that needs to be quantified experimentally in animal models of Sars-CoV-2 transmission. Even if B.1.1.7 does prove to be more transmissible, it is not likely to be transmitted in a different way from all the other circulating Sars-CoV-2 variants. It has not acquired viral superpowers that render existing precautions irrelevant, and it is still transmitted primarily through inhaling or having direct contact with infectious respiratory aerosols and droplets. One thing that is unlikely to make much of an impact is the kind of travel ban ostensibly imposed to prevent the export of B.1.1.7 from the UK. This reflectsa simplistic understanding of how viruses spread and evolve, as well as how we detect the emergence of new, potentially consequential variants such as B.1.1.7. The UK is a global leader in genomic surveillance, the practice of sequencing the genomes of the viruses causing new cases. B.1.1.7 is likely to be circulating in other countries already, and simply hasn’t been detected yet because of already high Sars-CoV-2 prevalence and less comprehensive genomic surveillance. Draconian measures can encourage panic and make the situation worse. When the lockdown and domestic travel restrictions were announced in the UK, passengers packed train station platforms and crowded carriages to leave London prior to enforcement of tier 4 restrictions, creating conditions conducive to virus spread. Rather than harsh and largely ineffective travel bans, we should instead focus on encouraging compliance with proven interventions such as masking, distancing, avoiding crowds and enclosed spaces, avoiding gathering outside of one’s household or quarantine pod, and practising good hand hygiene. By emphasising the additive nature of risk reduction, transmission can be reduced in a way that empowers people with the information to make good decisions to protect themselves and their families. Though we do not yet know for sure whether or not B.1.1.7 is substantially more transmissible, we do know that the pandemic is out of control throughout most of the world. We must balance scientific uncertainty with sensible approaches that we already know are effective at reducing community transmission, regardless of what we learn about B.1.1.7. Dramatic measures put in place through fear and uncertainty squander an opportunity to increase participation in the measures that are known to reduce transmission, regardless of a virus’s innate propensity to spread to new hosts. We have already suffered unacceptable losses from Covid-19. To truly contain the pandemic, leaders and policymakers should calmly educate and engage the public, rather than risking panic through scrambled, incoherent measures.

114841,commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-coronavirus-variant-b117-transmitting,Opinion,It's vital we act now to suppress the new coronavirus variant | Alan McNally,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-coronavirus-variant-b117-transmitting,"On Friday 11 December I was alerted to the fact that a large number of the samples showing positive in our Covid-19 testing laboratory in Birmingham were unusual. Like the other Lighthouse laboratories, dedicated to testing samples from the wider public, we are on the lookout for the presence of three particular genes, with a positive Covid-19 result requiring clean detection of two of the three. That Friday around 25% of all our positives were completely missing one of those genes – the S gene, which encodes the spike protein of the virus and is essential for viral attachment and entry into cells. It is not unusual to see some S gene drop-outs in positive samples, but usually in around 1-2% of them, not in 25%. At the same time this phenomenon was also observed in the Lighthouse lab in Milton Keynes, and communication was instigated with the Covid-19 Genomics UK (CoG) consortium, and our observation was reported to the national testing programme. In under a week it had been confirmed through the CoG genome sequencing data that the observed S gene drop-out was being driven by the emergence of a new variant of Sars-CoV-2, named B117. By Friday 18 December the rapid emergence of this new variant was alarming enough for government to convene an emergency cabinet meeting, announcing on 19 December tier 4 restrictions for the whole of the south-east of England and tougher restrictions on Christmas plans nationally. News of the new variant has led to multiple nations banning travel from the UK, and the closing of our Channel borders. The main question I am being asked now is: is this all commensurate with the threat posed? The B117 lineage is not a new strain of Sars-CoV-2. It is a new variant that has emerged from the virus that has been circulating in the UK. This new variant contains a surprising number of mutations in its genome – mutations arise constantly in viruses as they replicate and move from host to host. Most of these mutations are “silent”, causing no change to the virus structures and proteins they encode, or are damaging to the virus and die quickly. However some mutations result in a slight change to the structures on the virus, possibly making them marginally more efficient at transmitting, or replicating, or attaching to cells. In this case these mutations become advantageous – natural selection will occur for viruses containing these mutations and they will become more successful. In B117, there are an unusual number of these meaningful mutations. Three of the mutations have been observed in the past in many sequenced Sars-CoV-2 genomes, but have now converged to appear together in a single lineage in the S gene. In particular one of the three mutations in this lineage has been implicated in enhancing virus binding to host cells, and another implicated in avoiding antibodies in infections. The mutation implicated in virus binding also affects the ability of the fluorescently labelled probe used in our PCR Covid test to detect the S gene, meaning there is zero S-gene signal in tests positive for B117 variants. It is now clear that the B117 lineage is spreading quickly across the south-east of England, mirroring a stark rise in hospitalisations in the region. There is no evidence to suggest the new lineage causes any more aggressive a type of coronavirus infection, or is even more deadly, but it would seem to be transmitting very efficiently, with modelling suggesting a 65-70% increase in its transmissibility. Once we were clear that our S-gene drop-out test positives were being driven by the new lineage we were able to go back through our entire archive of test data and measure the rise of the new lineage. The resulting graph is worrying, showing an increase from the standard 2% of all positives, to almost 70% within the space of two weeks. This clearly suggests that the new lineage of Covid-19 appears to be able to spread very quickly, though it is not necessarily more deadly. Our lab does not process tests from Birmingham alone: samples are allocated to labs based on demand and capacity at both local and national levels. So we cannot make any inference on whether our data reflects local or national epidemiology, but it is clear that the new B117 lineage is rapidly dominating infections we are detecting in our lab network (the data from Milton Keynes and other Lighthouse labs is identical). We also know that cases of infection caused by the new lineage have been confirmed around the UK. The south-east of England is clearly the epicentre of the new variant of Covid-19 and it is spreading fast across the UK, and possibly abroad, with confirmed cases in Denmark and Italy. Not to act on the data and information currently to hand would be at least negligent – and potentially catastrophic. To wait for confirmation that B117 is more transmissible before implementing control measures would be ethically immoral. As Dr Michael Ryan of the WHO has said many times, to counter Covid-19 you must act fast and you must act decisively. If there is one thing the UK should know better than most, it is the acute cost of failing to heed that advice.

114891,commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-variant-coronavirus-genomic-sars-cov-2-pandemic,Opinion,Here's what we know about the new variant of coronavirus | Sharon Peacock,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-variant-coronavirus-genomic-sars-cov-2-pandemic,"It was always predictable that the genome of Sars-CoV-2 would mutate. After all, that’s what viruses and other micro-organisms do. The Sars-CoV-2 genome accumulates around one or two mutations every month as it circulates. In fact, its rate of change is much lower than those of other viruses that we know about. For example, seasonal influenza mutates at such a rate that a new vaccine has to be introduced each year. Even so, over time the virus population will accumulate a fair few mutations in different combinations. The striking feature of the Sars-CoV-2 lineage 1.1.7 that we discovered here at the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (familiar now from headlines as the “new variant”), is that its genome has a large number of mutations compared with other lineages we’ve picked up in the UK. It has a total of 23, which is what sets it apart. Most mutations aren’t concerning because they don’t result in a change in one of the amino acids that generate the proteins the virus is made from. When they do, that’s worthy of serious attention, especially when the mutations (or deletions) occur in a region of the virus that could change the way that it interacts with its human host. In particular, changes in the spike protein, which festoons the outside of the virus and is the mechanism by which it attaches to and enters the host cell, where it can replicate, are of great interest. What’s concerning scientists about lineage 1.1.7 is that, alongside six mutations that don’t change any protein, there are 17 (14 mutations and three deletions) that do. A preliminary genomic analysis of lineage 1.1.7 shows that several of these mutations have been described before in other lineages, and have been found to change the way that the virus behaves. One mutation (termed 501Y) has been shown to increase how tightly the protein binds to a receptor on the surface of human cells. A second change (69-70del) has been identified in viruses that evolved to evade the natural immune response in some immunocompromised patients. But nothing can be assumed about the new variant and what these mutations mean. We need more scientific evidence in order to understand how this particular version of the virus behaves compared with others. Here’s what we need to look out for: whether the variant transmits between people more readily, whether it causes more (or less) severe disease, and whether it can evade our bodies’ immune response. There is currently no evidence that lineage 1.1.7 causes more severe disease or that it evades the immune system. There is also no reason to think that the vaccines being rolled out or under development will be less effective against it. But what does look increasingly likely is that this lineage is more transmissible. In the UK, the body that considers new evidence about the virus is the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). The latest publicly available minutes show Nervtag has “moderate confidence” that this new variant is substantially more transmissible. The data that it looked at included a genomic analysis showing that this particular lineage was growing around 70% faster. In addition, it found a correlation between a higher R value and the detection of the new variant in testing samples. (The R value, remember, is the number of people each person passes it to. The higher it is, the more widely it spreads.) They also noted that the variant grew exponentially during a period when national lockdown measures were in place. It’s still possible that there are other explanations for this rapid spread, but the idea that this variant is more transmissible is plausible and seems increasingly likely. Laboratory studies that are now being done will answer this for certain. What this means in practical terms is that all our efforts to prevent spread – by washing hands, wearing masks and social distancing – become even more important. There’s nothing to suggest that the new lineage is somehow able to circumvent these, so long as we’re doing them properly. One question that may never be answered is where the new variant came from. The first place we detected it, by looking back through virus samples, was in Kent and London. But it’s not clear whether it actually emerged there. It’s worth remembering that the UK undertakes much more Sars-CoV-2 sequencing than many other countries, and the fact that we’ve found it here may say more about that than about its ultimate origin. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the variant may have arisen in an immunocompromised person who was chronically infected, with the virus able to replicate and evolve in them over a long period of time. But, as ever, more work is required to understand if this is actually the case. Looking to the future, we need to review our systems for predicting whether any given mutation could have health implications. In one recent survey of mutations that our consortium did, based on 126,219 genomes from positive samples, it was possible to identify 1,777 different amino-acid-changing mutations in the spike protein gene. Identifying concerning mutations is an imperfect process. There are tools available that model the changes to viral structure and function for any given mutation, but this modelling always needs to be confirmed by evidence. Not only that, but, the sheer number of mutations that need to be modelled is vast. For now, the way we identify mutations that might be important for human health is by tracking the rate of virus spread, carefully monitoring severity of disease, and having systems in place to alert us when the virus has been able to evade immunity generated by past infection or vaccination. The new variant first came to light in early December when Public Health England was looking at why infection rates in Kent were not falling despite national restrictions, and we married this observation with the genome data. The story of the new variant shows how important genome sequencing is, but it underlines the fact that it’s only when that genome data is linked to epidemiological and clinical information that it can make a difference in controlling the disease. Thankfully, unlike in past epidemics, we’re able to use this tool quickly and at an unprecedented scale. We should be grateful for that, because it is safe to assume that this won’t be the last time it’s needed.

114959,commentisfree/2020/dec/22/build-back-better-johnson-government-inequality,Opinion,'Build back better'? Johnson's government has no interest in tackling inequality | Oscar Rickett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/build-back-better-johnson-government-inequality,"In December 2006, two years after the Indian Ocean tsunami had brought terrible destruction and loss of life to large parts of south-east Asia, the UN published a report titled Key Propositions for Building Back Better. The author of this document, the UN secretary general’s special envoy for tsunami recovery, former US president Bill Clinton, wrote that “while a disaster can actually create opportunities to shift development patterns – to build back better – recovery can also perpetuate pre-existing patterns of vulnerability and disadvantage”. This warning can be neatly applied to the coronavirus-struck world of today. Clinton’s report seems to be the first use, at least on the international stage, of the now ubiquitous slogan “build back better”. The former president was obviously fond of it – he later used it for a humanitarian programme in Haiti that has been described as a grimly exploitative example of disaster capitalism – but it wasn’t until Covid-19 arrived that the phrase could be found everywhere, from Joe Biden’s presidential campaign to Downing Street’s “new deal for Britain”. The problem – or the whole point, if you are a duplicitous politician – is that this slogan is hopelessly vague and can mean almost anything. It could mean reinvesting in public services, instituting a four-day week, creating jobs in the green technologies of the future and a whole host of policy ideas campaigned for by the left and – polling suggests – popular with the public. The evidence so far, though, would tend to suggest that what it really means is creating ever more opportunities for the “wealth creators, capitalists and financiers” Boris Johnson heralded in June. The Marmot report, published this week and titled Build Back Fairer, tells us that Covid-19 has “exposed massive inequality” in Britain and argues that we cannot return to normal. The problem, then, is that our government seems intent on following in the footsteps of the disaster capitalists who have for centuries profited at times of war, disease and natural disaster, enriching themselves and those around them, while most people suffer or struggle to get by. Since the pandemic struck, I have been speaking to vulnerable people across the country, investigating the myriad ways the government is letting its citizens down and, in many cases, acting unlawfully. For these people, and for the lawyers and civil society campaigners trying to help them, the idea that Boris Johnson’s government has any intention of “building back better” is a grim joke. Rather, the government is using the pandemic as a cover for continuing to strip away support the state is often legally obliged to provide and then branding those who challenge it as – in the words of Priti Patel – “do-gooders” and “lefty human rights lawyers”. What this Conservative government means by “building back better” is actually just more of the same crony capitalism that has brought us the “massive inequality” the Marmot report highlights. During the pandemic, £1.5bn of taxpayers’ money has been handed to Tory-linked companies, none of which were major government suppliers before. While this has been great news for people such as Matt Hancock’s former neighbour Alex Bourne, who now finds himself with a plum contract to produce millions of Covid-19 test tubes for the NHS, it’s not what most people would imagine when they think of a better country. With Keir Starmer’s Labour party not offering a huge amount in the way of political opposition, those lawyers and do-gooders are on the frontline in the battle against the government’s push to strip away protections for its most vulnerable citizens. Last month, for example, the court of appeal found that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had acted unlawfully in failing to consult the children’s commissioner for England and other children’s rights organisations before rushing through a series of regulations that removed or watered down 65 safeguards for children in care in England. These regulations, described as “relaxing minor burdens”, were introduced on 23 April and came into force the next day, with no time for parliamentary debate. Tellingly, the changes mirrored proposals the government had tried – and failed – to introduce as part of the Children and Social Work Act 2017. Legal victories such as this have not stopped millions of British citizens from suffering during this pandemic. While Downing Street has been forced to spend more money on benefits and the furlough scheme, benefits advisers from local government, the Royal British Legion and the Child Poverty Action Group have all told me that the original problem remains the same: people forced to claim benefits are simply not given enough money. One adviser in Glasgow told me that the application of punitive benefits sanctions during the pandemic has meant that clients of his have “died all-but-destitute”. The austerity measures, first instituted in 2010, that have left local authorities unable to provide the support that their citizens are legally entitled to have remained in place. The parents of children with special educational needs are woefully under-supported, with many left to fend for themselves during lockdown. Asylum seekers are dying in Home Office accommodation, with one telling me that she was moved into accommodation also being used as a brothel after she gave birth. I am reminded not only of Bill Clinton in 2006 – “recovery can also perpetuate pre-existing patterns of vulnerability and disadvantage” – but of something the late, great reporter Wayne Barrett told me about the Trump family: “Desperation is the land they inherit and inhabit. Dark times are times of great opportunity for people of great stealth.” Oscar Rickett is a journalist who regularly contributes to the Guardian, Vice, Middle East Eye and openDemocracy",2020-12-22 07:00:09+00:00,114960,67
114969,commentisfree/2020/dec/22/uk-government-blamed-covid-19-mutation-occur,Opinion,How a string of failures by the British government helped Covid-19 to mutate | Anthony Costello,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/uk-government-blamed-covid-19-mutation-occur,"During the first wave of Covid-19 in Britain, many scientists – myself included – said the government should be pursuing a “maximum suppression” or “zero Covid” strategy. One of the many reasons for this was to stop natural selection doing its work. When a virus is allowed to spread, spending time in different hosts, it evolves and mutates. Scientists have now found a “mutant” variant of the virus that causes Covid-19, which has 17 alterations to its genetic sequences, including changes in the spike protein that enables the virus to enter our cells. Despite the warnings, the government’s strategy throughout the pandemic has been to slow the spread of the virus and reduce pressure on the NHS, rather than eliminating Covid altogether. As late as 13 March, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) minutes recorded that “measures seeking to completely suppress [the] spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak”. Advisers warned that countries such as China, where heavy suppression was already under way “will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed”. Instead of eliminating coronavirus, the logic seemed to be, Britain would learn to live with it. Nine months later, China and South Korea have recorded three and 12 deaths per million people respectively. By contrast, based on the government data for deaths occurring within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the UK has recorded 970 deaths from Covid per million people. Scientists only expected the virus that causes Covid-19 to undergo one to two mutations each month – but with an estimated 2 million people now infected with Covid in the UK, there are many more opportunities for the virus to mutate. The new variant seems to be accelerating transmission. Many have asked whether this will affect the efficacy of a vaccination programme – but this is something scientists could likely fix reasonably quickly by adjusting the RNA coding of the new vaccines. It’s not possible to tell yet whether the new variant of the virus will change the severity of Covid-19 in those who catch it. What’s certain is that the greater the number of people who are infected, the more chance a virus has to evolve. The government rightly fears that a surge in cases in southern England, where transmission is worryingly high, will spread across the country, and EU member states have banned travel and limited freight from the UK in an attempt to stop the variant spreading. Measures to prevent the spread of Covid are much the same as before – restricting household mixing, social distancing, travel bans, rapid testing, contact tracing and isolation, face masks, hand hygiene and working from home. Workplaces and schools will remain shut over Christmas, and the tier 4 lockdown in London and the south-east should dampen the opportunities for infections. For now, the government’s priority should be scaling up vaccinations as quickly as possible, and offering proper support to those affected by lockdown and self-isolation measures. But none of this was inevitable. The recent surge cannot be blamed on a mutant virus alone; in fact, government mismanagement of the pandemic meant that many more people became infected, creating the conditions for mutations to occur.
The failures of the government’s pandemic response are legion. An earlier lockdown by just one week in the spring could have halved the death rate, according to Nick Davies, a Sage adviser. Ministers wasted billions on outsourcing an allegedly “world-beating” test-and-trace system to private companies. It has failed to monitor rates of self-isolation and provided scant financial support to those asked to quarantine at home, relying on workers who don’t get sick pay, such as those in the gig economy, to isolate while losing wages. After Britain’s spring lockdown, infection rates fell, but the government again failed to do what was needed in time to suppress the virus. The government’s poor control of Covid-19 has increased the force of the infection and allowed more mutations to happen. On top of the economic costs of lockdown measures, the UK has now been effectively placed in quarantine by the international community. The prime minister’s repeated dithering, delays and seeming inability to make unpopular decisions have led Britain to have one of the worst death rates in the world. We have now cancelled Christmas and triggered international alarm. We can only hope that we’re not still in this position by Easter.

115164,commentisfree/2020/dec/21/after-the-northern-beaches-outbreak-we-must-be-ready-to-change-christmas-plans-at-short-notice,Opinion,"After the northern beaches outbreak, we must be ready to change Christmas plans at short notice | Catherine Bennett",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/21/after-the-northern-beaches-outbreak-we-must-be-ready-to-change-christmas-plans-at-short-notice,"Covid-19 is, by its very nature, unpredictable, and it can be difficult to compare outbreaks across settings. However, it is worth contrasting epidemic dynamics and public health responses in Sydney today with those in Melbourne in June given concerns that we might be on the verge of another large wave. By 20 June in Victoria, 25 new infections were reported, with three of these in hotel quarantine staff, taking that outbreak to 10 and the state’s weekly total to 107. Even though the hotel quarantine breaches were a known source of community transmission, only 25% of new community cases were linked to known cases or locations at the time of report, meaning many infections might have been missed. The proportion of cases that could be linked dropped further to less than 10% soon after.
In New South Wales on Monday, while we still do not know the point at which this overseas strain was introduced into the community, local transmission cases are linked to two critical seeding events in the northern beaches – 83 cases are all linked to one of two Avalon venues on December 11 to 13, either as attendees or their close contacts. Two remaining community cases may yet be linked when investigations are completed as they too are from Avalon. Back in June, Victoria’s public health capacity for chasing down community transmission had not yet been fully stress-tested as symptomatic people in the community were not tested unless linked to a known case, or if they had community onset pneumonia. NSW Health, on the other hand, has been chasing down community transmission cases and clusters since the virus was reintroduced into NSW from Victoria in July, and looked to have finally eliminated that transmission with more than 28 days free of local transmission of the Melbourne strain. NSW Health also routinely alerts the wider community of potential exposure locations to encourage testing of those at highest exposure risk, something Victoria was not doing until the tail of the second wave. Venue records are also now required across Australia. In June Victoria was testing up to 20,000 per day, NSW exceeded 38,000 on Sunday. NSW knows only too well what played out in Victoria over subsequent months, and this too should encourage people to engage, test and isolate. For all these reasons, there is likely to be more complete case identification in NSW now than in Melbourne in June, and so daily case counts may not be directly comparable. Another important difference lies in where the initial seeding into the community occurred. The hotel staff in Melbourne took the virus home to sections of the community with large extended households and casual workers often working across multiple locations. By 20 June, two aged care facilities were already in lockdown. It was the involvement of workplaces and healthcare settings that accelerated transmission and led to the rapid rise in Victoria’s case numbers. These outbreaks then seeded the virus into more households as workers took the virus home, spreading the virus across Melbourne and into regional Victoria. The restrictions in place on movements and mixing outside the home across Sydney, Central Coast and the Blue Mountains, and the hard lockdown in the northern beaches, provide a strong outbreak control position for NSW Health, allowing the public health response and contact tracing efforts to be more rapid, efficient and effective. Restrictions and lockdowns buy precious time for NSW Health to get ahead of the virus, map the edges of the cluster, and make sure the outer ring of exposed contacts are all in quarantine before they are infectious.
Covid-safe behaviours – distancing from others, practicing good hygiene and wearing masks when around others – all lessen the risk that a virus exposure will translate to infection. Masks are now strongly recommended in Sydney, but arguably it is time for mandatory masks on public transport and crowded indoor spaces. This should also be considered across states when we have active community transmission in the country. Some casual and close contacts of Avalon cases and people who visited hotspot venues reside outside the northern beaches and have returned home. We usually don’t know about active cases in our community until after they have tested positive and have been infectious while out and about. Wearing a mask reduces the risk of getting infected if exposed and, when done en masse, prevents secondary clusters. It is cruel this has happened so close to Christmas. We must now all be ready to change plans at short notice. Those in the northern beaches will soon know if they will be in lockdown at Christmas, but regardless the message will still likely be that it is not safe to bring households together indoors, especially for older relatives. For greater Sydney, Blue Mountains and Central Coast, travel limitations will remain, and travel and holiday plans for all Australians will be impacted and contingency plans the order of the day in case rules changes at short notice. But 15 cases on Monday, all linked, is encouraging news. We can also take heart that this is more akin to the outbreaks at the closing stages of Victoria’s second wave, not the start. • Catherine Bennett is chair in epidemiology at Deakin University",2020-12-21 01:45:50+00:00,115165,2

Sixteen million people are under new severe tier 4 restrictions and there are suggestions that these tougher new rules could be in place for months. Many more across the country have seen their plans torn up at the 11th hour. The reason for the government’s change of plan is a new strain of the virus, dubbed B117, that appears no more lethal than the original Sars-CoV-2 but is much more transmissible. European nations have banned flights from the UK, fearful that a mutant pathogen, homegrown in Kent, will spread across our borders and seas. If the new virus’s effect on the rate of transmission is as bad as government advisers’ fear then we will need a national shutdown of the kind imposed in March. The prime minister should have acted sooner. He may not have known exactly what was driving the growth in Covid cases but ministers have been aware for a week that something was going wrong. On Tuesday, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal warned that if current trends continued, even without the planned Christmas relaxation, there were likely to be 19,000 Covid patients in English hospitals by New Year’s Eve – the same as at the peak of the first wave in April. There are calls by influential Conservative backbenchers for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to resign, but the buck stops with his boss. On planet Boris Johnson it was all going to be terribly easy. Back here on Earth, reality has proved otherwise. Competence matters, and Mr Johnson doesn’t have it. The UK has registered a new daily record of coronavirus cases, reporting 35,928 new infections and 326 deaths on Sunday. The most important way to reduce the emergence of new mutants is to limit the spread of the virus. For the third time in a year, the government refused to face the facts and take the necessary action until much too late. Those delays have not only cost thousands of lives but have, cumulatively, shredded the trust in authority needed to boost compliance. This is all the more frustrating as the vaccine rollout offered new hope. More than ever, given increased infectivity, Mr Johnson needs to get an effective test-and-trace system and devise a proper support system for people to self-isolate. The prime minister ought to come up with a funded plan to make schools safe. Without these measures, Mr Johnson does not have a snowball’s chance in hell of escaping from months of lockdown purgatory. A mutant virus cannot wholly explain why we are in this mess or distract from the other failures that have led us here. The government ought to pursue a zero-Covid strategy that Independent Sage has long advocated. Compliance should not and cannot rely upon coercion. Had the government been wiser in setting rules, and more effective in communicating the regulations and advice and the reasons for them, it would not now be in the absurd position of sending police to urge people not to board trains home. Over this year, goodwill has not only been drained by the cumulative effect of lockdown, but squandered by official incompetence, the flouting of lockdown by Dominic Cummings and the discovery that while millions are struggling economically, the chumocracy has prospered from government handouts dished out with little scrutiny. That the bulk of the public still wants to do the right thing is despite, not because, of the government.",2020-12-20 18:48:27+00:00,115200,2

Mike Pence took his sweet time when it came to routinely wearing a mask in public. The vice-president was a lot less hesitant about embracing the coronavirus vaccine, however. On Friday, just a couple of days after the US reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases and the most deaths since the pandemic began, Pence received the vaccine live on television. It must be nice to be protected from your deadly policy failures. Pence is not the only man to have been skeptical of masks: plenty of studies have shown men worry masks are not masculine. However, it seems there aren’t the same fears about vaccinations. Men are more likely than women to say they planned on getting a coronavirus vaccine, according to three recent US surveys. A National Geographic survey found 69% of men surveyed said they were somewhat likely or very likely to take the vaccine, compared to 51% of women. A Pew Survey found that 45% of women would “probably not” or “definitely not” take a vaccine, as compared to 33% of men. A Gallup poll found 60% of women would take the vaccine compared to 66% of men. This data is somewhat surprising: conventional wisdom, backed by lots of global research, is that women are more likely than men to take the pandemic seriously and comply with public-health regulations. So why the hesitancy about getting vaccinated? One theory is that the anti-vaxxer movement, which is dominated by women, has infiltrated more mainstream female spaces. Recent research from researchers at George Washington University found members of online communities previously “undecided” on vaccines – groups for pet lovers or yoga enthusiasts for example – are increasingly connecting with anti-vaxxers. “It’s like a tumour growth,” one researcher said. Online misinformation, which Big Tech has done far too little to control, is an incredibly serious problem. Nevertheless, we should be wary about blaming hesitancy around vaccines entirely on Facebook et al. One reason women are disproportionately attracted to alternative medicine is because traditional medicine hasn’t exactly done a brilliant job of earning their trust. Women’s health concerns are often dismissed: one study found women with severe stomach pain had to wait 33% longer to be seen by a doctor than men with the same symptoms. Women’s health problems are also massively under-researched: there is five times more research into erectile dysfunction than premenstrual syndrome, for example, despite the former affecting 19% of men and the latter affecting 90% of women. In the US, medical research trials weren’t required to include women until 1993 because women’s bodies were considered too complex and hormonal. It’s not just women who have good reason to be wary of the health industry, of course. Considering the history of anti-Black medical racism in America, it’s not exactly surprising that the Pew Survey found that fewer than half of Black American adults say they intend to get a coronavirus vaccine, compared to 61% of white people. Black Americans have been experimented on (one word: Tuskegee) and forcibly sterilized. Black pain hasn’t been taken seriously by the medical establishment because of enduring racist notions that Black people have thicker skin than white people. Minorities are also underrepresented in clinical trials, which can result in technology and treatments that don’t meet their needs. Pulse oximeters, for example, which measure the oxygen levels in your blood and have been increasingly in use due to the pandemic, can give misleading readings in people with dark skin. A new study has found that misleading results happen three times more often for Black people. Probably because the colour of light used in the pulse oximeter can be absorbed by skin pigment. Which would have been something researchers would have caught straight away if they took diversity seriously. There is often a lot of sneering when it comes to distrust of medicine and science. People who don’t enthusiastically embrace vaccines are cast as uneducated and irrational. However, if history is anything to go by, it is perfectly rational for women and minorities to be wary of the medical establishment. To be clear: I’m not saying there is any reason to be hesitant about the coronavirus vaccine, which has been shown to be safe. I’m saying that you don’t change people’s minds by sneering at them or calling them stupid, you do it by earning their trust. And the health industry still has a long way to go when it comes to doing that. Gender stereotyping harms kids’ mental health, finds UK report Rigid gender stereotyping limits children’s potential and is fueling Britain’s mental health crisis, according to the findings of a new report commissioned by gender equality charity, the Fawcett Society. Stereotypes “significantly limit career choices”, the report says, and are at the root of girls’ problems with body image issues as well as higher male suicide rates.

The stakes could not be higher: even after scientists’ extraordinary feat of already developing five effective vaccines against Covid, we do not yet have enough of this precious resource that will save countless lives. This scarcity creates the ideal breeding ground for bad-faith politicking. But for politicians and unions to go down this road is to risk lives by further fuelling the vaccine scepticism that is reducing uptake, particularly among British black and Asian communities. There have been three utterly reckless examples of this in recent days, all of them cynical in their own way. First is Labour’s push to move critical workers up the queue for vaccines, spearheaded by Keir Starmer calling for teachers to be vaccinated during the February half-term.
The order in which people are prioritised for vaccines is decided by government, but informed by recommendations made by a Nice-style body of independent experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The committee is completely transparent about its workings: based on a primary objective of minimising death and severe illness, it recommended that the first phase of rollout should be focused on care home residents, people over 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable, and then those aged 50-70 and people with underlying health conditions. The JCVI rightly says occupational rollout should be a consideration in the second phase, but points out that vaccinating the first-phase priority groups targets 99% of avoidable deaths from Covid, including those associated with occupational exposure. The JCVI should be subject to scrutiny. But it should be informed scrutiny, based on an understanding of its rationale: anything else risks undermining public confidence in a high-stakes decision. Starmer’s entreaties were no such thing. Vaccinating younger teachers is a nice thing to do, but not if it comes at the cost of preventing avoidable deaths, and the data shows teachers (unlike taxi drivers or factory workers) are not at higher risk of death than the general population. Labour’s press release cynically tried to swerve this trade-off by calling for a “faster” rollout, as if there is an untapped supply of vaccines out there the government has ignored. It looks like a policy seized on for populist appeal with a retrofitted justification: first, Starmer implied it was to get schools open more quickly, but when it was pointed out this is unlikely to help with that, Labour’s deputy leader switched tack to say it was about teachers’ higher risk of death, despite the data to the contrary. Next up, the British Medical Association (BMA), which launched a very public attack on the government last weekend for adopting the JCVI’s recommendation to extend the gap between the Pfizer vaccine’s two doses from three to 12 weeks, the reason for which was to give as many vulnerable people as possible first-dose protection. Pfizer tested a three- to four-week gap in its clinical trials, but the immunologists on JCVI say there is no good reason to think the very good levels of protection from the first dose will wear off after this; in fact, they expect immunity from the first dose to increase over the 12 weeks. This hasn’t been tested in a trial, but we are living through a deadly pandemic and the risks of waiting for trial data have to be weighed against the lives lost as a result of rolling out the first dose of the vaccine more slowly. The JCVI made an expert call based on the balance of risks. It is monitoring the data in real time to check its assumptions and will advise the government to modify course if need be. There is a legitimate debate about whether it got that balance of risks right. But if a doctors’ union is going to risk undermining public confidence in the vaccine programme by announcing that the nation’s doctors think the government has got it wrong, you would hope they would at least engage with the detail of why. What evidence is there that the joint committee’s assumptions are wrong? Not only did the BMA’s letter to the chief medical officer, which was shared with the BBC, fail to set this out, it made the embarrassing mistake of inappropriately extrapolating from Israeli data to raise concerns about the effectiveness of the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. It hardly suggests expert immunologists were involved in formulating their intervention, which paved the way for non-specialist GPs to go on national news programmes lambasting the government for taking foolhardy risks. What exactly did the BMA achieve, apart from unnecessarily stoking public fears?
But the worst example of the last week was surely President Emmanuel Macron’s false claim to the world’s media that “all the indications” are that the AstraZeneca vaccine is “quasi-ineffective” for people over 65. This is nothing less than the president of the most vaccine-sceptical nation in Europe spreading disinformation. He is plain wrong: the AstraZeneca trial was not set up with sufficient numbers of over-65s to provide the same level of confidence of its effectiveness as in younger groups; all the indications are in fact that it is effective. This smacks of a leader who prefers to mislead his citizens that a vaccine is ineffective, rather than acknowledge the errors the EU has made in vaccine procurement, which has combined with bad luck to create a devastating situation where there is far less of this vaccine available than it ordered. Opposition politicians, doctors’ unions and presidents are all people who should know better. They are trusted by many and so must exercise a level of caution that befits such a high-stakes and sensitive arena of public health communications, before publicly and loudly questioning critical aspects of vaccine rollout that go beyond their expertise. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer of the Observer",2021-01-31 08:30:32+00:00,115552,2
115878,commentisfree/2021/jan/29/covid-vaccine-nationalism-row-eu-uk,Opinion,What can moral philosophy tell us about the Covid 'vaccine nationalism' row? | Alexis Papazoglou,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/29/covid-vaccine-nationalism-row-eu-uk,"In normal times, a row between the EU, the UK and a private company over the timely delivery of a contract would be of interest to few apart from the two sides’ lawyers. But these are not normal times, and this is no ordinary contract. The battle over the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine raises deeper ethical questions about who deserves priority access to a life-saving drug. It’s a discussion many countries have already had in a domestic context, where a consensus hasn’t been hard to reach: priority should be given to those who are most likely to catch or die of Covid-19, and therefore stand to benefit the most from a jab. But who should be prioritised for vaccination in the global context? “Vaccine nationalism” refers to a Trumpian kind of response to the issue, demanding “My country first!” It assumes that each country is responsible for the safety and wellbeing only of those living within its territory, not abroad. This seems to be the approach of the UK government so far: if the EU has problems with the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, then tough luck. This argument finds justification in communitarianism, the philosophy that argues our identities and values are intricately linked to the communities we belong to, and therefore our moral obligations are first and foremost to those who belong to our community – in this case, our political community. But according to a different, more cosmopolitan, approach, moral responsibility doesn’t stop at a country’s borders. The value of a person’s life isn’t dependent on where they live: everyone has equal moral worth. Utilitarianism, the moral philosophy that measures the value of an act by measuring its impact on overall wellbeing, doesn’t discriminate between British, French or Brazilian wellbeing. It sees the preferential treatment of those close to us as immoral, and as an unfortunate feature of human nature. According to this framework, the UK shouldn’t prioritise its own citizens, but treat the citizens of the EU, and indeed of the rest of the world, as equally deserving of the vaccines it has secured. The most vulnerable from around the globe should, as in the domestic case, take priority. So, which of the two ethical frameworks gets it right? One way that philosophers assess ethical principles is by testing them in thought experiments. Imagine a neighbour asks you for a favour, say to help them move, and a stranger asks you the same. Would it be immoral to prioritise your neighbour? That doesn’t sound quite right. In fact, the special ties you have with your neighbour make helping them seem like a kind of obligation, one you don’t have towards a stranger. Now imagine a different scenario: your neighbour is again asking for help with moving, but a stranger is at the same time crying for help, drowning in the lake next to your house. Here your moral duty is to help the stranger, not your neighbour. Both the ethical principle that says we should always prioritise those we have ties to, as well as the one that suggests it is always wrong to do so, have their limitations. No one moral rule can capture the particularities of every ethical conundrum; each case deserves its own attention. So, what about the particular situation the UK and the EU have found themselves in? By the time the UK had vaccinated over 10% of adults, including the vast majority of over-80s, the EU had vaccinated only 2% of adults. This means the proportion of people still highly vulnerable to Covid is much greater in the EU than in the UK. Should Britain let its neighbours have some of the 100m AstraZeneca doses it has secured? Let’s consider the extreme cases. If, say, the UK had vaccinated exactly the same percentage of people as the EU, there wouldn’t be any moral demand for the UK to share its vaccines. But if the UK had managed to vaccinate all of the groups most vulnerable to Covid, while the EU was still lagging behind, there would be a good argument for the UK to allow some of its vaccines to be diverted to the EU. Doing so would almost certainly save more lives. Given the current situation, and the fact the UK is suffering one of the world’s highest number of deaths relative to population size, there is a moral argument for prioritising its people. But it’s important to keep in mind that even though the political leadership of the country is democratically accountable only to its citizens, its moral accountability doesn’t stop with them. If and when the UK finds itself in better epidemiological shape than other countries, it will be time to help them out. Alexis Papazoglou is host of the podcast The Philosopher & The News.

The commitment, expertise and relentless efforts of scientists produced not one, but multiple vaccines, at astonishing speed. Manufacturing and distributing sufficient doses to meet global demand is an equally demanding feat. One result is the ugly and escalating row between the EU and AstraZeneca, which could see millions of doses blocked from being sent to the UK within days. The pharmaceutical firm warned last week that it would deliver only 25% of its expected supplies to the bloc in this quarter, following production problems. The aggressive tone of commission officials speaks to the domestic pressure that European leaders face. The EU has so far given only two doses per 100 residents, while the UK has delivered 11. Facing the backlash for a somewhat sluggish procurement programme, it cannot afford more delays. The legitimacy of the bloc and of individual governments are at stake, along with economic recovery. But instead of issuing threats, the EU should be working with suppliers and other governments. In essence, the commission argues that AstraZeneca made a firm commitment to deliver the doses, while the firm says it promised its “best efforts”. It is in no one’s interests to turn a contractual dispute into a political row which can be exploited by anti-EU movements. When a life-saving good is in short supply, there will always be difficult decisions to make, within and between countries. As pressing as the European shortages may feel, they are part of wider tensions. If richer nations must ration supplies, poorer ones so far have little or nothing to ration. The US has now joined the astounding number of countries which have signed up to Covax, the pooled procurement scheme designed to ensure a fairer distribution of vaccines. It hopes to deliver 2bn doses by the end of the year, with tens of millions due to be rolled out in the first quarter. Yet while countries such as the UK pat themselves on the back for their generosity in funding lower income countries, they have signed their own huge contracts with manufacturers – putting Covax further back in the queue. According to the chief executive of vaccine alliance Gavi, richer countries have ordered 800m surplus doses and have options for another 1.4bn. Britain alone has ordered 367m doses (albeit including as-yet unusable candidates) for its 67 million population. The desire to look after one’s own is understandable in both human and political terms. But to consign others to taking their chances is inhumane and short-sighted. The head of the World Health Organization said recently that we were on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure, with younger, healthier adults in richer countries being vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer ones. The emergence and rapid spread of new variants have demonstrated what global health experts warned all along: that none of us is safe until everyone is safe. Good international cooperation on vaccine policy would also boost the global economy by $9tn over the next four years, the International Monetary Fund has estimated. Richer countries should agree to share their surplus – as Norway has done – and ensure lower income countries have priority for Covax supplies. The rapid development of vaccines was possible because scientists shared knowledge, with Chinese researchers quickly publishing the genome sequence of the new coronavirus. The rest of us should learn to pull together, too.",2021-01-28 19:02:52+00:00,116015,2
116077,world/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/uk-covid-travel-quarantine-hotel,Opinion,The UK's half-baked Covid travel quarantine scheme will not work | Gabriel Scally,https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/uk-covid-travel-quarantine-hotel,"A fundamental step in handling an outbreak of an infectious disease is to locate where it originated and prevent any more cases of the disease coming into your community or country. If you can cut off the source, you can devote your resources and efforts to suppressing its spread, and coping with the health and social problems it has created. The approach of imposing isolation on arrivals, known as quarantine, is centuries old. At a time when an understanding of the nature of infectious diseases was virtually nonexistent, it was one of the few control methods that worked. In times of plague and pestilence, cities and states often applied it with enormous rigour. Almost a year after the World Health Organization declared that Covid-19 was a “public health emergency of international concern”, the UK government is imposing a regulated quarantine regime on some international arrivals. This extraordinary delay illustrates perfectly how far the country has distanced itself from its previous position as one of the leading exponents of public health in the world. It also demonstrates a pattern in the government’s handling of much of the pandemic response – taking action far too late and, even then, doing it halfheartedly.
It was not until 8 June that the government introduced a requirement for people arriving from most foreign countries to self-isolate for 14 days, later reduced to 10 days. The regulations were accompanied by the possibility of fines being issued for non-compliance. There is, however, little evidence of compliance with this system and a vanishingly small number of penalties appear to have been imposed. Covid-19’s ability to mutate and produce variants that may have decidedly different characteristics from their predecessors has forced the government’s hand. Priti Patel announced compulsory quarantine arrangements, involving hotel stays for passengers who cannot be refused entry, such as British residents and nationals returning to the UK, who are travelling from a limited number of countries, including known variant “hotspots”. These modest and disappointing proposals will undoubtedly run into several severe problems that could and should be avoided. Importantly, these new regulations do not replace the failed system of what amounts to voluntary self-isolation for the inadequate period of 10 days. The compulsory quarantine only applies to people travelling from the 22 high-risk countries. Everyone else arriving in the UK will continue to have to self-isolate according to the existing regulations. There can be no such thing as a partial quarantine. Either it is comprehensive and effective, or it will fail. A differential approach based on country of origin is undermined by the difficulty of accurately ascertaining where arrivals have come from. Global travellers may move across many countries during their journey and use various means of transport. During their travels, they may well have passed through multiple travel hubs and departure lounges, encountering and spending time close to many other travellers along the way. Determining who will be subject to self-isolation and who will be subject to mandatory quarantine will probably be a valueless task. Experience from elsewhere shows that operating an effective managed isolation facility is no easy undertaking. Preventing people who are isolating from mixing with others in the same position, in the same facility, such as a hotel, is difficult. In Australia, serious problems arose because of very close contact between people isolating and those working at the facilities. Whatever system of quarantine is adopted, the government needs to break with its insular habits and learn quick lessons from the successes and failures of other countries. An important rule for a quarantine system is that few, if any, exceptions should be permitted. Limited observance and the extensive list of groups that do not have to observe the rules will limit their effectiveness. There are up to 60 occupations or groups potentially exempt from isolation requirements, including everyone from bus drivers to workers in data system maintenance. One exempt group we should be concerned about are those commuting internationally at least weekly. Anyone can bring the virus with them, and everyone should have to go into managed isolation – especially if they travel often and have a greater chance of catching a new strain of the virus. After reaching a disgraceful toll of 100,000 deaths, it is time to focus on some key public health objectives. The government’s mantra on Covid-19 should be: “Get it down, keep it down, and keep it out”. That is how to maximise the benefit of the mass vaccination campaign and avoid it being undermined by variants. As recently as July and August, the UK and Australia had very similar daily new Covid-19 cases per capita, with Australia at times higher than the UK. Since then, Australia has succeeded in eliminating the virus. Successful quarantine and rapid response to flare-ups have created that success. The UK has no strategy, no overall objectives and no chance of making a half-baked quarantine scheme work.

But you know you are in a mess when you take comfort in the fact that we have “only” 20,000 or so new cases a day, when there are more Covid patients in hospital than during the April peak, and when many hundreds of people are still dying every day. So why are we in such a mess? Well certainly the new variant makes things worse, but that isn’t the whole story. As many people point out from their own experience, even though the situation is worse, we don’t seem to be doing as much to limit spread as during the first lockdown. We see more people out and about and the roads seem far busier. Personal experience is backed up by data: footfall in shops fell to less than 20% of regular activity last March, and now it is around 35%; the number of cars on the road went down to approximately 30% of normal levels in the first lockdown and is currently hovering around or above 50%. Combine these stats with the incessant speculation about “lockdown fatigue”, the ubiquitous headlines about the 150 people at a wedding, the 200 people at a house party, both trumped by the 300 people at a rave, then it is all too easy to conclude, along with Priti Patel, that the problem lies in the remarkable irresponsibility of fellow citizens breaking the rules. But it is essential to interrogate the premises of this argument more closely. Do mass gatherings spread the virus? Undoubtedly, yes. Should people take responsibility and avoid such gatherings? Certainly. But are these gatherings the primary factor in derailing our pandemic response? And is rule-breaking more generally the reason why we are seeing so much more activity in January 2021 than in April 2020? The answer is no. As I have argued previously, raves and the like may capture our attention, but run the risk of distorting our understanding of pandemic behaviour. According to both public polls and the government’s private polling, the great majority of the public are adhering to the rules, distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands. Week after week, the media asks if the public is about to crack, yet the evidence suggests it is staying steady or, if anything, adhering even more strongly. Of course, a small minority aren’t complying, but they are a problem, not the problem. The scale of their social interactions pales into insignificance compared with the impact of millions still going out to work. This was exemplified in the first week of this third lockdown by the government’s definition of “key worker”, which was so widely drawn that many classrooms were more than half full. It later changed its guidance, but still classrooms are five times fuller than during the first lockdown. These parents and children aren’t breaking the rules; they are following the rules. Moreover, even if they wanted to stay home, they often aren’t able to do so, with one study suggesting that over 70% of parents asking for furlough have been refused. One of the worst offenders is the government itself, as shown by the situation at the DVLA in Swansea, where staff were instructed by management to work on, even though there had been over 500 infections and spatial distancing was all but impossible. As if all this weren’t bad enough, it is compounded by the government doing little to ensure workplaces themselves are Covid secure. Between 6 and 14 January alone, there were 2,945 complaints about workplace safety issues. No action was taken. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 97,000 cases, but not one company has been prosecuted. Given the numbers at work, combined with the nature of their working conditions, it comes as no surprise that in the week ending 21 January workplace outbreaks reached a new high. With all this evidence, you don’t have to be Hercule Poirot to work out who is the culprit here. The more that Patel accuses the public and threatens them with greater punishments to secure their compliance, the less chance the government has of tackling the real cause of Covid transmission in our communities. The home secretary and her fellow ministers would do far better by restricting those required to go to work to a core of genuinely essential occupations, by ensuring that their workplaces are safe, and providing adequate support for those who need to stay at home. If the government were to take its responsibilities seriously, it would be in a far stronger position to ask the public to do likewise. In the end, we can only deal with this pandemic as a partnership, one in which both parties concentrate on playing their own part rather than whether the other is playing theirs.

116162,commentisfree/2021/jan/28/davos-elite-world-covid-vaccines-healthcare,Opinion,"At Davos, the global elite should ensure the whole world can access Covid vaccines | Larry Elliott",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/davos-elite-world-covid-vaccines-healthcare,"In different times, the president of South Africa would have been one of the world leaders in Switzerland this week for the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos. But the January talkfest has been online-only, and covered less avidly than usual by the media. That’s a pity in Cyril Ramaphosa’s case because of what he had to say about the dangers of “vaccine nationalism”: that while the leaders of the world’s richest countries keep insisting that Covid-19 is a global virus that respects no borders, they are simultaneously hogging vaccines for their own use. What’s more, they have failed to take the steps that would give poorer countries a better chance of coping with the pandemic. A report by the Economist Intelligence Unit showed that, though people in western countries can expect to be vaccinated during 2021, many of the world’s poorest nations will not have access to Covid-19 medicines until 2023 at the earliest. That’s a scary prospect. Africa escaped the worst of the first wave of the pandemic last year, but the second wave is spreading fast across the continent and health systems are in danger of collapsing. In a sense, Ramaphosa was too polite: this is not vaccine nationalism. It is – as the development economist Jayati Ghosh notes – vaccine apartheid. And the implications are obvious: much less chance of global herd immunity; much greater chance of genetic mutations; and much more stringent border controls, and for longer, in the attempt to prevent reinfection. There is also a geopolitical dimension. If western democracies choose to turn their backs on poorer countries, they shouldn’t be surprised if Russia and China export their vaccines as a way of advancing their own interests. Xi Jinping said in his speech to the online Davos that Beijing would help countries and regions less prepared to cope with the pandemic, and make sure Covid vaccines were available and affordable for developing countries. While western countries are preoccupied with their own immediate domestic problems, China is playing a long game. It should not be all that difficult to come up with a package of measures that would help. Richer countries that have cut aid budgets (such as Britain), or are contemplating doing so, should think again. The UK is on course to borrow £400bn this year and the £3-4bn the Treasury is saving by trimming development assistance is a false economy. There needs to be urgent action to head off a debt crisis that was in the offing even before the pandemic arrived. Some limited debt relief has been agreed by the G20 group of nations – but it is not enough, in part because private sector lenders are not included. Poor countries are still spending £67m a day on debt payments, money that could be spent on public health. The Jubilee Debt Campaign notes that most debt contracts are governed by English law, and the UK government should provide new legal protections to prevent poor countries being sued by private lenders who refuse to offer debt relief. In addition, the firepower of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank needs to be increased so they can step up their financial support. Developed countries have been able to flood their economies with cash through the money creation process known as quantitative easing, and the IMF could do something similar for poorer nations by issuing special drawing rights, which boost the foreign currency reserves of all member states. Even with more generous aid, debt relief and beefed-up support from the IMF and World Bank, it will be a stretch for poorer countries to afford patented vaccines, but they are prevented from producing cheaper generic alternatives by ferociously guarded intellectual property rules. Pharmaceutical companies say these are needed because the cost of developing vaccines is so high, but large slugs of public money are also involved in these endeavours. So, if rich countries are really serious about collectively tackling the pandemic, they should suspend intellectual property rights on therapeutic and preventive treatments for Covid-19. Ghosh says this is low-hanging fruit that could easily be picked, and she is right. Debt relief is possible. A better global financial system is possible. Compulsory licensing for lifesaving drugs is possible. Closing tax havens and making sure billionaires pay their fair share of tax is possible. It all comes down to political will. But one thing is for sure: unless some political will is shown, the global fight against Covid-19 will be a long-drawn out affair. A convoy’s progress depends on all its ships moving together.

116273,commentisfree/2021/jan/27/eu-vaccine-bust-up-astrazeneca,Opinion,The EU's vaccine bust-up with AstraZeneca is partly of its own making | Leo Cendrowicz,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/27/eu-vaccine-bust-up-astrazeneca,"Last year AstraZeneca was heralded for its pioneering vaccine discovery. Yet today the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company is embroiled in a dispute with the European Union over claims that it is holding back vaccine deliveries for the bloc, while diverting supplies to Britain and other countries. But can AstraZeneca be blamed for the EU’s stuttering vaccine rollout, which is far behind Britain, the US and other countries? Anger is certainly surging across the EU about the slow pace of vaccinations. The latest figures from Our World in Data reveal that just 2.1% of the EU population has received a vaccine, compared with 10.8% for the UK. The goal to vaccinate at least 70% of the EU’s population by this summer is wildly off – at the current pace, the bloc as a whole would reach only 15% by the end of September. On the face of it, the EU has locked in far more vaccines than it needs: the European commission has secured a portfolio of more than 2.3bn doses, which is more than five times the EU’s 450 million population. It has contracts with five different vaccine makers: not only AstraZeneca, but Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and CureVac. It has also wrapped up exploratory talks with Novavax and Valneva. The commission negotiated the contracts on behalf of the EU as a way to avoid the ugly free-for-all that erupted last year, when national governments squabbled over orders of PPE and medical devices. The idea of a centralised procurement policy was not only to ensure a fair deal for all, but to leverage the collective negotiating weight of the 27 EU member states.
However, the EU approach came with strings. The commission, negotiating for the first time on vital medicines, felt that EU countries would demand value for money, so it dragged out the talks to secure better prices and product liability guarantees. That meant it signed the contracts with AstraZeneca in August, three months after the UK’s contract. The EU’s joint approach may have secured lower prices and guarantees, but it came at the expense of speed – and at such a critical moment, it can only watch as the UK, which paid the full price, is benefiting from its early orders. The approval process was also strung out. Last year, worried that vaccine scepticism might hamper the rollout, the commission and national governments insisted the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) should not stint on its vital regulatory scrutiny. But that meant the first EU-approved vaccine, by Pfizer/BioNTech, was only offered from 27 December, some 16 days after the UK started to use it. The AstraZeneca vaccine is yet to be approved by the EMA (this is expected on Friday) but it has already said production snags at its EU sites mean it will only deliver about 40% – or 31m – of its 80m promised doses to the EU in the first quarter. This shock setback has infuriated officials in Brussels and the EU member states, who have ordered a total of 400m doses. The vaccine spat is, almost inevitably, charged with Brexit-tinged rancour. The fact that AstraZeneca, headquartered in Cambridge, seems to be favouring the UK market is seen by Brussels as undue bias, while British ministers counter that leaving the EU gave them the freedom to secure vaccines faster. Both the EU and the UK accuse one another of protectionism and vaccine nationalism. However, AstraZeneca has not helped its case with what Brussels sees as indifference. In an interview with Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper, CEO Pascal Soriot effectively told the EU to calm down. Soriot said that his company only committed to meet demand to its “best effort” and added that the delays were due to startup issues in the European production sites. “Unfortunately, it’s really bad luck,” he said. There is also a dispute about what the contracts say. Soriot says the British agreement prioritises supply coming out of the UK sites, while EU officials say they are not tied to any particular production facility. To prove its case, the commission called on AstraZeneca to publish the vaccine contract, which is currently restricted by a confidentiality clause. The EU has issued threats over the delays. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, said the EU “means business” about getting its fair share of vaccines. The commission is now moving to set export controls on vaccines, insisting manufacturers with facilities in the EU should notify authorities of any shipments outside the bloc. “Which doses have been produced, where and to whom have they been delivered?” Stella Kyriakides, the EU health commissioner, said. Officials have damped down suggestions they could block exports, saying the “transparency mechanism” aims to ensure manufacturers meet their contractual obligations to the EU. The forceful approach is backed by EU countries, with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, calling on Tuesday for the “fair” distribution of doses, while the Italian government wants to take AstraZeneca to court to force them to fulfil their signed contracts. But for all the EU seething, its leverage may be constrained by the contracts themselves. While the commission has not published its advance purchase agreements (APAs), partly redacted details of its deal with CureVac say that “the delivery dates set out in this APA are the contractor’s current best estimates only and subject to change”, adding that “the parties acknowledge that there is a risk that … the timeline for scaling up the production of the product may be delayed”. There was good news for the EU when French pharmaceutical company Sanofi said it will help supply 125m Pfizer/BioNTech doses from July to help meet the huge demand. But that is little consolation now, as the EU waits for the rest of its vaccines to arrive. • Leo Cendrowicz is a Brussels-based journalist who has covered Europe for more than two decades",2021-01-27 17:05:11+00:00,116274,2
116305,commentisfree/2021/jan/27/european-union-slow-covid-vaccination-programme,Opinion,Why has the EU been so slow to roll out a Covid vaccination programme? | Guntram Wolff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/27/european-union-slow-covid-vaccination-programme,"For the European Union, the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is critical to save lives and prevent health services from being stretched beyond their limits, not to mention minimising the massive economic damage from lockdowns. Unfortunately, however, though vaccinations are under way, a rapid near-term increase in infections is likely as the British variant of the virus spreads across the continent. The problem for the EU is compounded because its vaccination programme already trails Israel, the UK and the US. The best performing EU country, Denmark, has vaccinated a meagre 3.6 people per 100, compared with 45 in Israel and more than 10 in the UK. Germany and France are even further behind. More worryingly, there are no signs that the vaccination rate in the EU is accelerating, unlike in the UK and US, where daily vaccination rates have increased substantially in the past few weeks. The European commission and European leaders have recognised the need for rapid action. The commission intends to have 80% of those over 80 and the same percentage of health workers in the EU vaccinated by March, with 70% of the adult population vaccinated by the summer. Acceleration of the vaccination campaign is now the EU’s number one priority. Why is the EU lagging behind? The central issue is not so much the organisational issues, but the lack of vaccines. Even Denmark has had to slow down its campaign significantly because of short supply. Many countries now report fully operational vaccine centres but insufficient vaccines. As always in such complex issues, there is no single answer as to why this is happening. Part of the explanation is that the EU ordered too few vaccines too late. It was slow to order the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, even when it became the frontrunner and its efficacy had been documented. Member states hesitated to ask the EU to order more because of the novelty of the technological approach, and the commission leadership did not push hard enough for additional purchases. Purchases were slowed down further as the EU insisted that liability in case of negative side-effects on health remains with pharma companies and therefore rejected early emergency authorisation. Many EU countries neither wanted nor asked for faster authorisation because of this liability issue. Pros and cons can be debated, but risk aversion in many EU countries is a fact. Anti-vaccination movements may have also added pressure on political decision-makers. EU funding has also proven insufficient. Last year’s EU vaccine strategy allocated €2.7bn for advance purchase agreements, research and capacity. This was increased by €1.09bn in September. But these numbers are small compared with the $18bn the US provided through its “Operation Warp Speed”. Low EU purchase prices per vaccine might have further slowed down deliveries. In recent days, there has been a debate about whether some pharma companies have breached the terms of the contracts with the EU. The EU has pre-financed the development and the production of the AstraZeneca vaccine and wants to now know exactly which doses have been produced and where, so it can assess whether contractual obligations are breached. An export transparency mechanism is being used as a threat to ensure that contractual obligations are fulfilled in case of breach of the contract. But AstraZeneca’s CEO has pointed out that the UK signed its contract three months before the EU and the UK factory also started operating earlier, increasing supply capacity. Moreover, according to AstraZeneca, its contract with the EU does not oblige early deliveries. Only publication of the contract can allow outsiders to judge this spat. There is an argument that the EU was slow to develop an industrial strategy to increase production. The factories of competitors should have been mobilised as soon as possible to increase the total supply of vaccines. Sanofi has now agreed to use its factory in Frankfurt to produce additional Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. The former Novartis factory in Marburg, Germany, will soon produce vaccines in large amounts. Why did governments not push earlier for more such agreements and increase financial resources to make them profitable for companies? Last, the EU was not prepared for the pandemic. Only once it was under way did EU countries authorise the commission to start joint purchases. The US had institutions such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority supporting research as early as February 2020. Building a racing machine only when the race has started means delays.
It is impossible to say how things would have gone if there had not been joint EU action. It seems safe to say that many EU countries would not have been able to negotiate faster vaccine deliveries with pharma companies. It also seems fair to say that the pressure from the Trump administration on pharma companies to deliver for the US market first was huge and EU countries individually would have had less leverage. Moreover, the politics of vaccine nationalism within the EU would have been toxic. But the EU must now learn lessons. It needs institutions comparable with those of the US to deal with such situations. The commission’s initiative to boost the European Health Emergency Response Authority is to be supported. EU citizens should decide how much risk they are willing to take when it comes to vaccine authorisation and liability, and leaders should provide more financing for vaccine development and procurement. For now, the EU’s priority must be to mobilise all financial and political resources to increase vaccine supplies. • Guntram Wolff is director of the Brussels-based Bruegel thinktank",2021-01-27 15:22:43+00:00,116306,2
116309,commentisfree/2021/jan/27/worried-covid-variants-mutations,Opinion,How worried should we be about the new Covid variants? | Sharon Peacock,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/27/worried-covid-variants-mutations,"The recent announcement that the Covid variant first detected in the south of England could be more deadly than its predecessor was alarming to everyone. In truth, without more evidence we can’t be absolutely certain of a direct, causal link between this variant and a higher risk of death. There are other explanations, including the limitations of the data used so far.But it would be unwise to make any assumptions about coronavirus. Mutations are expected in any virus, and we know that the rate of mutation in Sars-CoV-2 (perhaps one or two in its genome a month) is low compared with other viruses, including flu. But what’s more important than the rate of mutation are the opportunities this virus has to mutate. The more humans become infected, the more opportunities the virus has to develop and change. Currently, about 100 million people have been infected with Covid-19 (the true number may be even higher because of asymptomatic infections). Each one of these people is another opportunity for mutations to occur. This is why we must do whatever it takes to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 and prevent it from spreading through the population. Whether a variant is cause for alarm depends on whether it results in one of four important traits: if it affects the transmissibility of the virus; the effectiveness of Covid-19 tests; our immune response to the virus; or the likelihood of us developing severe disease. If a variant is more transmissible, it can be more successful at infecting people. If it can evade the human immune response, it may be able to reinfect people who have already been infected or vaccinated. And if a virus has acquired both of these properties, that’s a reason for concern. Scientists are now focused on three global variants that were first detected in England, South Africa and Brazil. Although the terms “South African variant”, “Brazilian variant” and “English variant” are frequently used, they’re unhelpful – viral evolution is happening everywhere, and individual countries can’t be blamed for the emergence of particular mutations. Moreover, countries that do the most viral sequencing, such as the UK, where the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium – of which I’m the founding director – has sequenced just under half of the world’s Sars-CoV-2 genomes, will find the largest number of new variants. The World Health Organization is working on an internationally agreed system for naming variants. Like tropical storms, we’ll need to find memorable ways of referring to new Covid-19 variants. The variant first detected in England, commonly known as B117, is estimated to be up to 70% more transmissible, although vaccines being delivered across the country are expected to be effective against it. It has become the leading cause of infection in the UK and has already been reported in 64 other countries. This ability to spread has been linked with a mutation found in the genetic code for its spike protein, which sits on the outside of the virus and allows it to attach on to human cells. In lab experiments, the mutation results in higher binding of the variant’s spike protein to the human receptor.
The second variant that came to global attention was detected in South Africa, where it was linked with a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases. It goes by several names, including B1351, but the key thing to note it is that as well as being more transmissible (it has the same transmissibility mutation seen in the variant in the UK), it has an additional mutation that may also reduce our immune response. So far, this variant has been reported in at least 26 countries, with 77 cases detected in the UK. The third variant, which was first detected in Brazil, has the same two mutations linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immunity. Most of the evidence about the mutation in the variants found in Brazil and South Africa, which may enable them to evade our immunity to Covid, is based on laboratory experiments. These involve exposing the virus to serum from people who have been infected or vaccinated in order to detect whether the virus is neutralised by their serum antibodies. These lab tests have shown that the variant detected in South Africa is less readily neutralised by the antibodies in people who have already been infected with Covid-19. Scientists are still working to define what this means for the risks of reinfection in humans, but it doesn’t imply that vaccines won’t work against these new variants.
Nonetheless, stories of people in South Africa and Brazil becoming reinfected with this new variant, after already having contracted Covid, are worrying. South Africa has also reported that antibodies in plasma from people who previously had Covid-19 didn’t neutralise the new variant in almost half of cases that were tested. Of course, this is early data, and we’ll need further studies before we can draw conclusions. But these observations underline the importance of travel restrictions and of testing and quarantining new arrivals. Though vaccines are vital to controlling the pandemic, they may not prevent vaccinated people from developing less severe or asymptotic infections and transmitting the virus to others, allowing future mutations to emerge. Social distancing, wearing masks, vaccines and viral sequencing (the science that can detect new variants and determine their significance) are our best hopes of driving down Covid cases and protecting our communities. These won’t be the last variants we’ll see, and Covid-19 will continue to surprise us. But if we get infection rates to as close to zero as possible, we’ll reduce the risk of future mutations that can find chinks in our immunity armour.

A further 1,631 deaths from Covid-19 were recorded, taking the official tally above 100,000, though data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the total number will now be nearer 120,000. In a briefing, Boris Johnson has said his government did everything it could to minimise the loss of life, but these deaths were far from inevitable. While the number of UK deaths has entered the hundreds of thousands, New Zealand has recorded only 25 deaths from Covid-19 so far. Taiwan has recorded seven, Australia 909, Finland 655, Norway 550 and Singapore 29. These countries have largely returned to normal daily life. In the first year of the pandemic, the UK faced three big challenges. Our national government had no long-term strategy for suppressing the virus beyond a continual cycle of lockdowns. Even now we still don’t know what the government’s plans for the next six months are. In the early days of the pandemic, the UK treated Covid-19 like a bad flu. The government halted testing, and the initial plan seemed to be allow the virus to run unchecked through the population (the “herd immunity” approach). Finally, ministers have pitted the economy against public health, instead of realising that the health of the economy depends upon a healthy population. Those in the anti-lockdown camp mistakenly believe that we could have traded these deaths for a “normal life” and a strong economy. Yet this isn’t how Covid has played out in any country in the world. Either you reopen the economy before the virus is under control, and endure thousands of deaths, or you manage your public health problem before getting the economy going again. Throughout the pandemic, Britain was overreliant on modelling, cynical fatalism and complicated solutions. The challenge was never what to do when faced with this new virus, it was going out and doing it. The complexity was in logistics, human behaviour, messaging and leadership. Where exactly did Britain go wrong?
First, the UK had no border policies in place for months. When introduced, these were lax and unmonitored. Borders are the first line of defence against a novel pathogen and a way to catch new variants and infections before they have a chance to spread. Countries that managed to effectively contain Sars-CoV-2 implemented screenings of new arrivals and 14-day quarantines for those entering the country. Some even restricted travel to national citizens. In March, when the UK went into lockdown, people were instructed to stay home while passengers from any country could arrive at Heathrow and take the tube straight into London without a Covid test. In the summer, we had a window to prevent future infections. Instead, the UK encouraged overseas holidays via “travel corridors” that contributed to the second wave. We paid for summer holidays with winter lockdowns. The second fatal flaw in the UK’s response happened on 12 March, when the government made the fatal decision to stop community testing, abandoning its line of sight over who had the virus and where it was spreading. Community testing is absolutely vital for controlling the virus. This was later resumed, but England outsourced testing and tracing to private firms instead of using local public health capacity. Isolation – a key part of the test, trace, isolate response – was only ever an afterthought, and there has been little support for people who would struggle to stop working for 14 days. Even now, the majority of people have been refused a discretionary self-isolation payment, while statutory sick pay is a paltry £95.85 a week. By contrast, Finland and Norway offer 100% and 80% of income to people who are self-isolating. The result of the UK’s inadequate support is that many who have tested positive have ended up going into work and infecting others. Third, the government made another harmful decision in March when it delayed the first lockdown. Though numbers were already running out of control, the cabinet appeared to think that delaying restrictions would make them less painful, for fear that “behavioural fatigue” would set in. Yet the opposite is true. If a lockdown is necessary it is better to do it earlier so that restrictions can be lifter more quickly on the other side. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland seemed to have learned this lesson, unlike England which delayed again restrictions in September and then December when it was clear numbers were taking off.
The fourth error was the lack of appropriate personal protective equipment for many health and social workers who struggled during the first national lockdown in the spring. Many were exposed to Covid-19 on wards, and none had access to testing. At the start of the pandemic, it felt as though health workers were the unprotected goalies on the football pitch; they coped with a massive surge of Covid patients without the necessary safeguards, and 883 health and social care workers have died of Covid-19 since March. Finally, the UK has continually lacked both clear leadership and messaging, which are vital in a pandemic. Rather than leading from the front, the government seems to only follow public opinion and polling. We spent months debating whether face coverings matter before adopting them and weeks debating whether Covid-19 is indeed serious or just a bad flu. We were encouraged to stay at home, then encouraged to “eat out to help out” in crowded restaurants. We sacrificed seeing our families and were fined for breaking lockdown rules but never heard Dominic Cummings apologise for flouting the lockdown. The result has been a complete breakdown of trust in the UK government. While it is easy to be consumed by anger, grief, frustration and depression at this moment, we must keep looking forward for a path through this crisis. We must never have a winter like this again, and we need a concrete plan and strategy to make sure Britain does not face a third wave and a fourth lockdown. This must involve suppressing transmission, building a functioning test, trace, isolate and support system, guarding against the reimportation of infections with strict travel restrictions, while trying to reopen schools and as much of the domestic economy as possible. A country as global and interconnected as Britain faces a particularly painful choice over borders and international travel. It would be a tragedy for the UK to vaccinate the majority of the population by the autumn only to then import a new variant or strain of Sars-CoV-2 that our vaccines can’t guard against. Vaccine companies would need to race to reformulate their jabs, and we would probably be caught in further restrictions to buy the time for that to happen. Let’s learn the lessons of the past year, and not wait for another 50,000 deaths to act. • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2021-01-27 11:00:09+00:00,116346,2

The O stands for “Oh my God, I hate Mondays, let’s sack it off till Tuesday instead”. I know none of us wishes to come off as impatient, but what are we actually doing here – trying to give the new variants a sporting chance? Intriguing that even at this stage the UK should regard itself as the scratch golfer of pandemic-handling, happy to allow the virus 32 shots, endless mulligans and several weeks of frictionless travel. Then again, maybe you have to take your wins where you can. For the past month, the virus has been the only thing able to cross our borders without getting tied up in red tape. Either way, Boris Johnson’s government continues to make pandemic decisions with all the speed of the Supreme Soviet Secretariat. Don’t ask for agile turnarounds. It would honestly be quicker to get Brezhnev to greenlight a clean energy programme. This is great for people who really enjoy lockdowns, who ideally want to wear four masks at once, who enjoy unnecessarily deep economic collapse, and who believe that a generation of children getting thrown under the bus is the price you have to pay for whatever version of purity they prioritise. For everyone else, it’s the most giant, toxic, damaging, endlessly mishandled arseache. Right back last spring, pandemic lesson 101 was that once lockdown is rationally inevitable, the time to do it is now. The later you man up and actually push the button, the longer you will have to lock down for, the more economically and socially punishing it will consequently be, and the more deaths there will be. We learned this – or should have – many, many long months ago.
Even if you are the type of politician or individual who is – how to phrase this? – more relaxed about high death rates, you presumably care about the economy and social freedoms. So in short: what the gibbering shit are you doing? Why, more than nine months after we made this mistake first, do you still call for the same stripe of mistake to be made and expect a different outcome? As for the parliamentary restriction sceptics, who are partly responsible for the length of our current lockdown, where do they get off now shrieking about its extended harms? As it goes, I hope schools do start going back in mid-February, and am thrilled to read Public Health England declaring primary schools safe to open after half-term. But spare me the giving-of-a-toss about children by the likes of Mark Harper and Steve Baker from the so-called Covid Recovery Group (CRG). Has there ever been a misnomer like it? You might as well call the Luftwaffe the East End Recovery Group. These guys are the cowboy builders of the pandemic. They turn your leaking pipe into a collapsed central heating system, then tell you only they can fix it. In case they’ve forgotten, Mark and Steve & Co spent most of late autumn and early winter raging noisy public war against any form of lockdown or restrictions – and Boris Johnson listened to them. So when are such people going to take some responsibility for the fact that the schools have ended up having to close because in the end infection was so out of control there was nothing else for it? When are the “Covid Recovery Group” going to take some responsibility for the fact their science-free objections to taking action in timely fashion means we all have to pay a heftier and lengthier price at the back end of the lockdown instead? The answer, of course, is never. Because what they wield is power without responsibility. They can seemingly make the prime minister do what they want, at least until things have gone so tits up that he has no choice but to U-turn. Yet despite being exactly the type who always bang on about people taking personal responsibility, they never take any themselves. Taking personal responsibility is for the likes of the poor and the obese. And so it is that we have to listen to people such as Steve Baker posturing that they don’t like the predictable and predicted effects of precisely the things they spent October, November and December demanding. Come to that, what is Steve Baker even doing on a Zoom feed? He should be standing in the freezing cold on docks offering to fill in forms for fishermen about to lose their businesses thanks to another one of his brainwaves. Which brings us to the conclusion that the new awkward squad is largely the same as the old awkward squad. Many of the personnel from the Brextremist European Research Group (ERG) have simply migrated to the CRG, and the rest of us are once more dragged along for the ride. The UK’s decades-long subservience to this relatively small number of Conservative wingnuts recalls nothing so much as Kingsley Amis’s relationship to his own libido. “For 50 years,” he reflected, “it was like being chained to an idiot.” • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",2021-01-26 13:47:18+00:00,116523,67
116567,commentisfree/2021/jan/26/second-covid-dose-uk-jabs,Opinion,"Delaying the second Covid dose in the UK is controversial, but it's the right decision | Deborah Dunn-Walters",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/26/second-covid-dose-uk-jabs,"A recent YouGov poll shows that the British are among the most willing in the world to take the Covid-19 vaccine. This is good news. But there are still questions about the vaccines and the way they’re being deployed, especially after the government decided to spread out the time between the two doses from three weeks to 12 weeks. The confusion is understandable, as we are in a developing situation. Clear messages about why tough decisions are made can get lost in the noise. First, it is absolutely clear that the two Covid-19 vaccines that are being deployed in the UK will save lives. Moreover, they will reduce the burden on hospitals. The Pfizer data, measured from day 14 post-vaccination, showed only one severe case of Covid-19 in 21,000 vaccinated people. The AstraZeneca data showed no hospitalisations or severe disease in 6,000 vaccinated trial participants. The caveat to this was that there were a small number of cases in the first two weeks after the first vaccine dose. This brings me to an important point. The vaccines need time to work. Vaccines prepare our immune system to defend against infection by showing it a small part of the virus, in this instance a “spike protein” that appears on the outside of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Our immune system produces a bespoke response to this protein, making antibodies and memory cells which it stores away against future need. Creating these initial antibodies and memory cells can take a couple of weeks, so there is a lag time before you start to be protected. If our immune system later sees the spike protein again, it can bring out all its pre-made resources to act immediately. So why do we need two jabs? Immunity elicited by the vaccine can be boosted. When the spike protein appears a second time and the immune system brings its armoury out, the immune memory cells will rapidly increase in number and more antibody will be produced to neutralise the virus. This will happen whether the spike protein is in the vaccine or on a live virus. To get the best response possible, the current vaccines were designed to have a second “boosting” dose after the first “priming” dose. The UK government’s decision to change the timing of the second vaccine dose has been controversial. After all, if you have evidence that scheme A works, why would you use an untested scheme B? But the decision will not have been taken lightly and there is some basis in the current data available. AstraZeneca trials reported early indications that a longer interval between doses is beneficial. Pfizer trials did not have such data, but the similar Moderna vaccine elicited immunity lasting just under two months after one dose. It boiled down to simple sums based on real-world scarcity: if a vaccine protects people from disease by 89% after one dose and 95% after two doses, and someone gives you just 200 doses this month, you can choose to protect 95 people after three weeks or 178 people for 12 weeks. One worry is that the change in timing could encourage “virus escape”, resulting in worrisome new variants. The rationale is that if you don’t kill off a virus immediately, mutations will enable the virus to survive better. But it has equally been argued that allowing natural infection would also be a reason to cause mutations. After all, the new variants that concern us now – from England, Brazil and South Africa – appeared before vaccines were rolled out. Also, simply by fighting the virus with these vaccines we are putting it under pressure to evolve. An optimistic view is that our immune memory is diverse and dynamic enough to adapt and counter any viral escape. It is encouraging that early data from the mRNA vaccines show they work against some of these variants. Close monitoring of the situation is necessary, but in the face of the current emergency we should try to save as many lives as we can as soon as possible. This is why it’s crucial that we do not change our good social behaviour just because of vaccination. Even with 95% vaccine efficacy, one in 20 people could get Covid-19. We also need to consider virus carriage and transmission. When we catch the virus, our immune systems immediately roll out to fight it. The response may be so effective that we don’t have any symptoms or even realise that the virus has briefly inhabited our bodies, yet we could still have passed it on to others.
We do not yet know to what extent the vaccines block this type of virus transmission. The recent reports from Israel of up to 60% protection after just one dose do not really contradict the Pfizer study data (which show 89%), because the former measured the presence of the virus and the latter measured disease symptoms – they may simply illustrate the point that protection from disease is not the same as protection from having the virus, and 60% protection from carrying the virus is encouraging. Immunity is not all or nothing. There are degrees of protection depending how good the vaccine is and how good your immune system is in responding to it. Some factors, such as age, health status, and type of virus variant, may mean that immunity is reduced. What we urgently need now is robust monitoring of the vaccine rollout to help us understand how different individuals’ immune systems respond to the vaccine, how the vaccines work against the different variants, and how the changes in dosing schedule affect the efficacy of responses. This will help us be more certain of our answers in the future.

That’s the good news. The bad news? All the people who have received a jab in Africa could fit comfortably on the top deck of a London bus. According to the World Health Organization, just 25 people, in a continent of 1.3bn, have been vaccinated. The 25 – in Guinea – are the only people in any low-income country to have received a Covid vaccine. Some middle-income countries, most notably India, have set up ambitious vaccination programmes, but poorer countries have lost out. The Covax facility was set up to make vaccines globally available. It claims to have secured 200m doses from manufacturers and hopes to acquire 2bn doses in total. So far, none has been delivered. Part of the problem is vaccine hoarding. The richest countries have ordered more than 4bn doses, often paying extra to jump the queue. That’s 16% of the world’s population acquiring 60% of the vaccines. Canada has ordered enough to cover its population five times over.
There’s also the problem of government incompetence – exemplified by South Africa – and a lack of infrastructure for distribution. But mostly it’s an issue of how a profit-based system fails when it comes to a desperate social need. The difficulties have led some poorer countries to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies. South Africa has ordered 1.5m doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. But it’s paying $5.25 (£3.83) per dose – more than twice as much as European nations. The creation of Covid vaccines is testament to scientific ingenuity. The scandal of its distribution is a demonstration of abject moral failure. Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",2021-01-24 06:15:37+00:00,117018,2

In the UK, we are losing more than 1,200 people a day to the virus and the total number of people who have died is almost 100,000. Countless people have lost someone they loved to this disease. It is a national tragedy whose scale would have been unthinkable in early 2020. Most governments have been struggling to contain this virus. The new variant circulating in the UK, thought to be 30-70% more infectious, and which scientists think might be more deadly, poses new challenges as the vaccine gets rolled out. But our government has repeatedly made serious errors that have resulted in a higher-than-necessary death toll. The government’s consistent hesitancy in taking swift action to contain the spread of the virus has cost lives. It imposed a national lockdown too late last March, again left it too late last autumn, and went ahead with relaxing restrictions in the run-up to Christmas against the advice of many scientific experts. It should have introduced a national lockdown more quickly in light of the growing evidence that the new variant was more infectious. The prime minister’s reluctance to make difficult decisions – together with a lack of cabinet competence that has manifested itself in the shambolic roll-out of test and trace, for example – has proved lethal. Boris Johnson and his cabinet appear to have no understanding of the way people in low-paid work live their lives – and it shows. They have led a pandemic response that has offered far more protection to the comfortably affluent than it has to those who do not have professional jobs they can do from home or who cannot afford to follow the government’s public health advice.
The government’s messaging has focused on imploring the public to comply with the rules, while emphasising that those who do not follow them will be met with steep fines and enforcement action. Yet data suggests that, on the whole, people are complying with the rules as much as they can. The biggest area of non-compliance, however, is with the requirement to self-isolate for 10 days after a positive test, or coming into close contact with someone who has tested positive, which is so critical to slowing the spread of the disease. Government surveys have suggested that as few as one in five people with symptoms are coming forward for tests and as few as one in four report compliance with self-isolation. Too many people only qualify for statutory sick pay at just £96 a week if they test positive and some of the lowest-paid workers in the least-secure forms of employment are entitled to nothing at all. Just one in eight workers is eligible for a discretionary £500 lump sum if told to self-isolate and many do not know at the time of applying whether they will get it. This puts people in the dreadful position of having to make a choice between protecting their families and colleagues by following public health guidance or being able to afford to pay their rent and feed their children. Addressing this lack of financial support for people to self-isolate is an urgent public health priority. One option would be for ministers to guarantee no individual will suffer a loss of earnings as a result of self-isolating if required, as suggested by Jeremy Hunt in an interview with the Observer.
The government’s focus on enforcing the rules for members of the public has far exceeded any efforts to clamp down on employers who are pressurising employees to return to work too soon after a positive test or who are breaking Covid rules. Not a single employer has been issued with an enforcement notice for Covid safety breaches since early January, despite thousands of complaints having been sent to the Health and Safety Executive. And as we report this week, the largest known Covid outbreak at a workplace has happened at the DVLA, a government agency. Workers were reportedly told to turn off their test-and-trace app to avoid being notified if they had come into contact with a positive case, employees with symptoms were encouraged to go in and vulnerable workers have had their requests to work from home turned down. How can the government credibly police employers when it is breaking its own public health guidance and putting employees at risk? A government that put as much emphasis on protecting the low paid who cannot work from home should also revisit regulations for public transport, workplaces and public spaces in light of the more infectious variant. It should consider making higher-grade masks compulsory in public spaces and providing these masks free to those who must still go out to work. The huge success story of this pandemic so far has been the vaccine rollout: here, ministers deserve real credit. But it will be months before we have enough population-level immunity conferred by a vaccine to get back to something approaching normal life and that is assuming we do not see the development of vaccine-resistant strains. The government has rightly asked all of us to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS from being overwhelmed. But it must fulfil its side of the bargain, by immediately taking proper measures to protect low-paid workers, many of whom have been working to provide essential services through national lockdowns. If it fails to do so, more people will lose their lives.",2021-01-24 06:00:37+00:00,117028,2
117028,commentisfree/2021/jan/24/listen-to-nhs-trust-leaders-we-know-it-is-too-soon-to-loosen-covid-restrictions,Opinion,Listen to NHS trust leaders. We know it is too soon to loosen Covid restrictions | Chris Hopson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/24/listen-to-nhs-trust-leaders-we-know-it-is-too-soon-to-loosen-covid-restrictions,"Throughout the pandemic, NHS trust leaders have argued for appropriate restrictions on social contact to bring Covid-19 under control. It is they and their teams who have to deal, in a distressing and direct way, with the daily death and harm that this dreadful virus brings. They know that, until we can vaccinate our population, restrictions on social contact are the only way to prevent unnecessary deaths, reduce patient harm and give the NHS the best chance to treat all the patients it needs to. So it should be no surprise that, as discussions start on loosening the current round of restrictions, trust leaders remain deeply cautious. There can be no simple, blanket approach to decision-making here. Each phase of the pandemic has its own characteristics and dynamics. Any relaxation will need to be evidence-based and take account of significant local variations in infection rates. And trust leaders have always been clear that these must be decisions for elected politicians as only they can balance the complex and difficult trade-offs required using the evidence and advice they receive. But trust leaders believe there are a number of reasons to be very cautious at this point. First, the new variant is behaving in very different ways from the virus in the first phase. We know it’s significantly more transmissible. But there’s a lot we don’t know. There are, for example, good reasons to believe that the drop in case numbers will be significantly slower than in the first phase. One of the distinguishing features last summer was how quickly case numbers dropped once the peak had been crested. If we relax restrictions on the basis that case numbers will decline on a similarly rapid basis this time, we risk loosening too quickly. We need an appropriate amount of data on how steep and rapid the drop in case numbers will be after this peak before making precipitate decisions. This will also give us more time to understand the risk from the other new mutations now in circulation. Second, trust leaders point to the importance of infection rates dropping to a very low level before relaxing restrictions. The experience of trusts in the north of England between September and November was that virus prevalence never really went away in their areas over the summer and, as soon as restrictions were lifted, case rates, hospital admissions and deaths rose rapidly. NHS leaders want to see case numbers drop consistently to much lower levels, for a longer period of time, before we start lifting restrictions this time. This links to the importance of the NHS having sufficient capacity. Because of the NHS’s success in developing treatments for Covid-19, the mortality rate from the disease has dropped significantly. But the corollary is that any outbreak means NHS hospitals will have larger numbers of seriously ill recovering patients needing long hospital stays than in the first phase. If we want to manage the risk to the NHS, we need to ensure the service stabilises and returns to more manageable levels of demand. Current predictions are that the NHS has at least four to six more weeks of the current levels of intense pressure and will need time thereafter to be confident of dealing with any new surge triggered by loosening restrictions. We can be confident that the current vaccination campaign will, over time, reduce the pressure on hospitals as more people are inoculated against the worst effects of the disease. But the precise interaction between increasing vaccination rates, reducing rates of hospital admissions and relaxing restrictions remains opaque because there’s a lot we still don’t know.
We still can’t guarantee what the supply of vaccines will be and therefore how quickly we will be able to vaccinate the population. We still don’t fully understand the impact of vaccination on transmission and need more data before deciding how soon we can loosen restrictions without triggering infection and resulting in death and harm in those who haven’t been vaccinated. Mortality and harm rates are highest among the four priority groups who are due to be vaccinated by mid-February, including care home residents and carers, frontline health and care workers, the clinically vulnerable and people over 70. But it’s vital to remember the impact of Covid-19 on those who will have to wait longer. They can still die, contract long Covid and require hospital treatment. There is a strong link here to pressures on the NHS. The government has rightly said it will take full account of these pressures in its decision-making. But the pressure in hospitals is twofold – on both general and intensive care beds. While hospital admissions are very strongly skewed to the over-70 age group, that is not the case for ICU admissions. According to data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre, the current mean age for ICU patients since September has been a disturbing 60 years old. So the vaccination campaign will help with the pressure on general hospital beds much more quickly than it will with pressures in intensive care units. NHS trust leaders are as keen as everyone else to return to normal. They can see the adverse impacts of the current restrictions on mental health and the wider economy. But the shocking number of Covid deaths and widespread patient harm of the last few weeks make them deeply concerned about loosening restrictions too rapidly. There is already a growing chorus of voices pushing for a loosening of restrictions. That will only grow over the next few weeks. Those voices need to be resisted. We should only loosen restrictions when we have the evidence and data to confirm that we can do so without triggering a further full-blown wave of infections.

Though the evidence is hardly encouraging, it must. More than 38,000 Covid patients are in hospital in the UK, and another is admitted every 30 seconds. More than a thousand people are dying each day – each one a painful absence in countless more lives. The Office for National Statistics says that in the week to last Saturday the percentage of people testing positive for Covid decreased slightly in England and levelled off in Wales and Scotland, though it rose in Northern Ireland. But as Prof Chris Whitty warned, levels remain very high, very precarious and are not declining in all places and age groups. One major survey has suggested that new infections are now stable or possibly even rising slightly. Worryingly, it appears that the new UK variant is not only more transmissible, but may also be more deadly, and some fear that the South African and Brazilian variants may be less susceptible to the current vaccines. The more that is learned about them, the clearer become the dangers of assuming there is a “safe” level of coronavirus within the community: when it is being transmitted more, it is more likely to alter. The pace of vaccination is cheering and must be maintained – but it will not be enough to get us out of this crisis. The government cannot undo many of its most terrible mistakes; the public has already paid for the late lockdowns and the Christmas relaxation. But it need not repeat its errors, and can fix others. Its reluctance to tighten rules quickly enough, and rash insistence on relaxing them too fast, must end. The prime minister was uncharacteristically sombre on Friday, saying that there could be “another big rebound” if restrictions are released too early. Prof David Spiegelhalter of Sage has predicted “the mother of all battles” next month if deaths and infections drop considerably while hospitals and their intensive care units remain under heavy pressure: “Loosening it up will inevitably lead to an increase in cases, a resurgence of the pandemic among younger groups and … that does seep through into hospitalisations,” he warned. Another key failure has been the government’s counterproductive reliance on punitive messaging – such as the announcement of £800 fines for those attending large parties. Despite some appalling breaches of the rules, most people are complying, and have often been more careful than instructed. It is not only that this attempt to shift the blame is insulting. It is that it allows the government to avoid tackling the real problem: the rules themselves, which mean too many people are going to non-essential work; and the failure to help people to abide by them – by communicating them and the reasons for them clearly; and by offering adequate support. People will continue to take their chances when they do not fully understand the risks, when they cannot afford to do otherwise, or when their bosses force them. Ministers have finally recognised that wanting to avoid self-isolation is the single biggest reported barrier to requesting a test. The government’s polling suggests that only 17% of people with symptoms are coming forward. The proposal for a £500 payment to all who test positive is a welcome sign that the penny has dropped – though overhauling one of the meanest statutory sick pay schemes of any developed nation, and catching the low-earning self-employed via a sizable payment through universal credit, would be smarter and more affordable. The government should also trial other forms of support for self-isolation, including the provision of accommodation, to cut household transmission. Other workers report being ordered back into the workplace unnecessarily, including into unsafe conditions. Decades of underregulation and underfunding of agencies have left them with little protection; the Health and Safety Executive is simply not equipped to tackle this problem. Councils should be supported to inspect and take action. The mooted introduction of quarantine hotels for international arrivals, instead of relying on self-policed isolation, is a long overdue measure. Ministers have had months to think about many of these options. It is enraging that even now they struggle to engage with them. But they can still fix their failures – and they must.",2021-01-22 18:30:02+00:00,117206,2
117296,commentisfree/2021/jan/22/silence-died-covid-figures-grief-pandemic,Opinion,When will the government break its silence over those who have died from Covid? | Billy Quilty,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/22/silence-died-covid-figures-grief-pandemic,"Some 100,000 people have now died from Covid in the UK – almost one person in every 660. Such numbers are hard to comprehend. Several weeks ago, when 78,000 deaths had been recorded, BBC Newsnight anchor Kirsty Wark closed the programme with a video of the Olympic Stadium during the 2012 games, full to its 80,000 capacity, to demonstrate the scale of this loss. The government has so far made no mention of plans to commemorate these deaths, and several weeks into England’s third national lockdown, many people are now enduring another epidemic: grief with no real outlet. Despite these numbers, some people are still denying the risks of Covid-19. While getting a haircut shortly before restrictions were imposed in my area in late October, my barber said something we’ve heard so many times before: “It’s no worse than the flu. I don’t know anyone to have died from it, do you?” Although most of us can extend our empathy beyond our immediate social network, stories of Covid deniers suggest that some people will not be convinced about the risks of this virus until they’re personally affected by it. Whether you know somebody who has died from Covid-19 partly depends upon how many people you know, a number that varies dramatically. To get a ballpark figure, we can use a 2013 study from researchers at the University of Columbia, which found that the average person knows 600 other people by name. This social network might include co-workers, acquaintances, school friends, neighbours, former colleagues, your plumber, GP, and so on. Working on the basis of this estimate, we can use probability theory to calculate that if each of us know an average of 600 people, and more than 100,000 people have already died in the UK from Covid, then roughly 60% of us may know someone who has died from Covid (here, the chance of having died from Covid is calculated by dividing 100,000 by the size of the UK population as a whole). But averages don’t give us the full picture, which is more complicated in reality. Our social networks are highly clustered by demographic factors such as age, ethnicity, geography and socioeconomic status, and the people we know tend to be in the same demographic groups as we are. Some groups have been far more affected by Covid than others; we know that key workers are at a greater risk of catching Covid, that the risk of death increases exponentially with age, and that black people are about four times more likely to die from Covid than white people in England and Wales, as a result of social factors such as poverty and racial discrimination. Deaths are also twice as likely to occur in the most deprived local authorities as in the least deprived. This means that, tragically, communities who were already disadvantaged before the current crisis – people living in poor areas, ethnic minority communities and the elderly – are now those more likely to be wracked by grief. How we perceive the pandemic is shaped in part by the impact it’s had on those in our immediate social circles. This is hardly a new concept. It’s more difficult to empathise with loss if all we see are large numbers. We often have greater sympathy for a single death, even more so when that death is given a face and a name. When the image of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old boy who drowned in the Mediterranean when fleeing the Syrian civil war, was published in newspapers in 2015, donations to the Swedish Red Cross jumped over a hundredfold in the days following its publication. An estimated 250,000 people had already died as a result of the war, yet prior to the publication of the image, engagement with the crisis was minimal. This response to large numbers is the same for our current crisis. The morbid repetition of daily death statistics can numb us to the scale of this tragedy. When presented with huge figures, we tend to focus less on the actual number itself and instead concentrate on the direction and magnitude of the change compared to the previous day: is it getting worse? Is it getting better? But behind each number is the death of a person who leaves behind a grieving family and friends. When the US reached 100,000 deaths, with little response from the Trump administration, the New York Times published 1,000 names of those lost on its front page. The Guardian’s Lost to the virus series has likewise shone a light on the individuals whose lives were cut short by Covid-19. But the government’s response to these losses has been one of muted indifference; there has been no talk of a national day for mourning, nor discussion of memorialising these deaths. As the pandemic goes on, the chance that someone we know will die from Covid will grow. Some people, however, may never experience that loss. It’s therefore crucial that we empathise with the grief of others and do all we can to prevent spread of the virus. And we need to commemorate the lives of those who have died. The charity Marie Curie has called for a national day to reflect, grieve and remember those who lost their lives on 23 March, one year on from England’s first national lockdown. The government should follow this example and break its silence about our collective grief. We all must remember that daily death figures aren’t just numbers: they’re someone’s parent, grandparent or dear friend.

I forwarded it to a neighbour, who said: “This cuts off just before our houses. This is basically: ‘Don’t go to the supermarket down the road.’” Is it a sign of cognitive impairment that I can’t find my own house on a map? Not really: I can never do that. Still, we had ordered tests by then. I was reasonably sure we were an early-adopter household in the matter of the pandemic. Mr Z had a meeting a year ago with someone else who had just had a meeting with Nadine Dorries, and he felt mortally unwell after that when the news broke that she had Covid. She’s been our go-to yardstick of wellbeing ever since. How do you feel? Well, a bit rough, but not like I’ve had any proxy face-to-face contact with a junior Conservative health minister. Maybe six hours after the text, he wanted to know if he felt hot. I am not a fan of this ritual. We own a thermometer. We really don’t need to hand-check each other’s foreheads like a pair of gibbons and then have a fight about whether there’s been user error in the matter of hands. It’s like trying to guess the time using the sun when you have a clock on your oven. But he seems to like it. Unless I say he’s not hot – then he doesn’t like it at all. “You’re not hot,” I told him. “Get the thermometer … Look, it’s 37.3! I’m at the outer limit of normal.” “That is normal. That is exactly normal.” “It’s the highest you can be without a fever.” “A fever is 37.8.” We were arguing about things you can Google. One of us had to be ill, surely? I was, if I’m honest, feeling a bit peculiar. I wasn’t hot. I didn’t have a cough. I had perfect taste and smell. I didn’t have fatigue, or did I? What is tired? How much energy? I felt like a dog meme off the internet. I’d forgotten what normal was. My main ailment was that I didn’t have any appetite, except when someone left a fish finger sandwich half-eaten on their plate, then I worked through it like a robot vacuum cleaner. Maybe I was just bored? Looking for a pointy stick to clean the crumbs from between the cooker and the counter, I realised that in 47 years, I’ve never done that before. It’s a symptom of something, isn’t it, compulsive cleaning? Oh right, it’s a sign that you’re pregnant. No, wait, it’s a sign that you’ve been pregnant for ages, and you’re just about to go into labour. So, not that then. “It doesn’t feel like tiredness,” said my friend, who had Covid over Christmas. “It’s more like the life force has drained out of you and all your muscles have become a kind of lumpy soup.” OK, I didn’t feel like that. It was more like – I don’t know if anyone else, in the 90s, when they were young and stupid, took a popular illegal drug known as ecstasy? Imagine you did; now imagine that point in the night, say 5am, where it’s wearing off, but you haven’t been to sleep. So you’re simultaneously tired and wired, and you can’t wait to go to sleep, yet at the same time don’t want to. I felt like that. “Ugh,” she said, “you could never just get Covid, could you? You have to have bon vivant’s Covid.” I went upstairs to check how Mr Z was. “I’m fine,” he said, in dudgeon, as though the question had been: “Have you returned from the realm of the second rate?” The competitively hot phase was over, and we were now in competitive recovery. My result came through; I’d tested positive. “I feel like Wilfred Owen,” I said. “I feel like I’ve been shot on the last day of the war.” “You are nothing like Wilfred Owen: a) the war isn’t over; b) you’re still alive; and c) you have created no significant body of poetry.” “You know what they say about marital disharmony? Try to use ‘I feel’ expressions.” He was just sore because his test results weren’t back. I was sore because I basically had Tory MP Covid, where you say you’ve got it, but can still make a medium amount of sense on GMTV from your weird living room. It’s not that I wish I were more ill. I just hate Tory MPs. Underneath that amorphous, Matt-Hancock-centred indignation, possibly underneath all indignation, I feel really guilty, as if I’ve undermined the national effort just by getting it. I feel relieved it’s not worse, then guilty about feeling relieved, as if I’ve failed a basic solidarity duty, not played my part, been a virus-freeloader. The only thing that would make me feel worse than admitting I have it would be to not admit it. The only thing that will make me feel better is if Mr Z also has it. Look, it’s marriage – I don’t make the rules.",2021-02-28 14:00:15+00:00,117408,107
117554,commentisfree/2021/feb/27/it-is-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-turn-on-the-unvaccinated,Opinion,It is only a matter of time before we turn on the unvaccinated | Nick Cohen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/27/it-is-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-turn-on-the-unvaccinated,"It is easy to see how the pandemic could lead to class and racial strife by imagining how the UK will stand in six months’ time. The vindictive will start to describe Covid as a sickness of choice. Its victims will be victims of their own stupidity. They might have accepted vaccination. They might have protected themselves and others if, as seems likely, vaccines limit infections. Rational people will ask why they should continue to accept restrictions on their freedoms because of ignorant delusions. Employers will demand to know what possible argument there is against allowing the owners of pubs, airlines, restaurants, hotels or holiday homes to demand proof of protection when immunity passports might save their business. To make it personal, how would you feel come the autumn if someone you love contracted cancer and the NHS delayed treatment because it had to look after needlessly ill Covid patients? The poor suffer disproportionately from Covid as they suffer disproportionately from everything else. But it could soon be a sickness of poverty. In Birmingham – the only city to have produced detailed statistics – just 60% of people over 80 accepted the jab in Alum Rock, a deprived and racially mixed part of the inner city, while 95% accepted it in Sutton Four Oaks, an overwhelmingly white commuter suburb. Public health workers told me of their fears, but said they could never speak their minds in public. So let me spit it out for them. If good citizens who have taken their jabs, see poor white people, ultra-orthodox Haredi Jews, black or south Asian men and women, they may remember the stories about anti-vax illusions and cross the road or move down the bus to avoid them, or refuse to hire them or provide them with services. We have been lucky that to date the public faces of the anti-vax and Covid-sceptic movements have been upper-middle-class white men. Laying into the likes of Piers Corbyn and Toby Young is a pleasure as much as a journalistic duty. The only prejudice you worry about fanning is a legitimate aversion to over-indulged cranks. How long this relaxed state will last as demands to punish the unvaccinated grow is another matter. The right supplies one answer to vaccine apartheid. It opposes immunity passports as a step on the road to a dictatorial society where we won’t be able to work or play without some functionary demanding we produce our papers. Conservative fears aren’t wholly neurotic, but they should not allow their myth of the freeborn Englishman to fool them into believing that the majority of the population won’t welcome passports as a route out of lockdown. The right cannot go further than rejectionist opposition because all attempts to stop Covid-19 becoming an endemic infection involve a reordering of society. There are hundreds of thousands, maybe more than a million, undocumented migrants in the UK. As Gracie Bradley of Liberty pointed out to me, Theresa May’s “hostile environment” for migrants makes them frightened of visiting vaccination centres. When the NHS shares data with the Home Office and immigration enforcement, they have every incentive to stay away. Since he was mayor of London, Boris Johnson has toyed with offering an amnesty for illegal immigrants. Conservatives and many others hate the idea because it rewards migrants who broke the rules. But the practical arguments for regularising the position of countless thousands who dare not report a crime, appear in court as a witness, or protect themselves and wider society by agreeing to a vaccine should crush all doubts. An amnesty is essential, and now would be a good moment for the prime minister to find the backbone to take on the Conservative core vote, assuming he has a backbone to find, that is.
The housebound, the homeless and many people with severe mental and physical disabilities need vaccinations to come to them because they cannot or do not know how to reach NHS centres. In short, they require a bigger NHS and stronger state, not the minimal state of Tory dreams. Yet when all the nice social democratic proposals have been offered, the fact of wilful ignorance remains. As so often with conspiracy theories, the endorsement of elite charlatans is vital to its spread. Emmanuel Macron’s attempt to cover up the failure of the European commission to supply vaccines with the false claim that the Astra-Zeneca inoculation is “quasi-ineffective” for older people has fuelled anti-vax sentiment across the continent, and will lead to many preventable deaths. Extreme religious elites are less visible but no less calculating. I spoke to workers at Migdal Emunah, a charity that fights forced marriages and child abuse in Haredi Jewish communities. I could not understand how religious leaders could accept a Covid infection rate nine times above the UK average. They told me what I should already have known: theocrats would do anything to avoid legitimising the scientific worldview. Once they allow modernity in, once they accept that the works of men are superior to the commands of God, their control of the mind and body, particularly of women’s bodies, would be at risk. Better to tolerate death and sickness than allow the rotten structure to fall. The left is usually blamed for failing to take on reactionary ideas in minorities. But if it is crippled by liberal guilt and the demands of electoral expediency, then the right, or parts of it, is simply indifferent. It doesn’t know about the conflicts in minority communities and doesn’t see the need to know either. Doctors and, to their credit, government ministers, understand they must allay people’s fears. There’s nothing wrong with reaching out but at some point they will need to take on the propagators of fatally fake news with more vigour. If they do not, we will be in an intolerable position. The poor, among whom ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented, suffer the greatest health inequalities. During the pandemic, they disproportionately risked their lives in frontline services, while experiencing the highest death rates. As the pandemic slows down, they will continue to suffer the highest death rates along with new variants of the old plagues of racism and snobbery. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",2021-02-27 19:00:32+00:00,117555,2
117858,commentisfree/2021/feb/26/jab-job-uk-goverment-covid-vaccine-passports,Opinion,"No jab, no job – the moral minefield confronting the UK government | Gaby Hinsliff",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/26/jab-job-uk-goverment-covid-vaccine-passports,"It’s the exclusive club millions long to join, the VIP pass that promises to smuggle us past the velvet rope. Although so far, it’s only for older and vulnerable people. Every day, the Covid jab starts to look more like a golden ticket back to normality, or at the very least a holiday. Without one, it’s already impossible to book many cruises, or an international flight with Qantas. And in more daring pensioner circles, it’s becoming the key to an illicit social life too. An older acquaintance let slip this week that underground dinner parties are back among his friends, although invites are strictly limited to those who are jabbed. He hasn’t yet dared take advantage, but wonders whether, when legal socialising resumes this summer, vaccine refusers will find themselves social pariahs. With the vaccine’s promise of freedom comes a dilemma over how to deal with those who refuse to accept it. Uptake in Britain has been enviably high so far, rising as a smooth rollout inspires confidence. But research has consistently predicted that it would be most popular among older people, with vaccinators likely to meet more resistance as they work their way down to those young enough not to fear dying.
Uptake among care home workers – as low as 52% in London, according to figures obtained by the shadow care minister, Liz Kendall – is ringing alarm bells, although it’s unclear whether that’s solely down to reluctance or difficulty reaching appointments. This week, one of Britain’s biggest care home operators announced that staff who refuse the vaccine will be considered to have made themselves unavailable for work. For weeks, ministers have been downplaying the idea of vaccine passports, which could be used to deny people who are unjabbed access to pubs, clubs, sporting or musical events, and potentially some workplaces. But this week brought a sudden volte-face. Now Michael Gove is to lead a review into whether they might be feasible, once all adults have been offered a dose. Presumably, it hasn’t escaped ministers that promising twentysomethings a summer of Reading festival and football matches and clubbing, but only if they take the vaccine, could powerfully incentivise the age group most likely not to bother. Although officially the cabinet remains open-minded, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that he would “probably do pretty much sort of anything” to go to the cinema or theatre again. Not everyone, however, is so desperate to see the latest James Bond. The pressure group Liberty warns that vaccine passports could create a “two-tier society”, where unvaccinated peole overlap too closely for comfort with those who are already marginalised and discriminated against. Vaccine uptake is lower in BAME communities, targeted by disinformation campaigns and often with good historical reasons to distrust authority figures, but also in poor white communities. People who aren’t registered with a GP, move around frequently, or live pressured and chaotic lives are also easily missed. It doesn’t seem unreasonable that care workers nursing frail nonagenarians should be expected to do what they can to avoid accidentally killing them, just as surgeons are required to have hepatitis jabs in order to protect their patients. But if care workers can be pressured into choosing between jab and job, then what about bus drivers or hairdressers, or tradespeople coming into people’s homes? Unions worry that some employers might scrap safety measures at work, relying on hiring people they know have been vaccinated as a cheap way of keeping Covid out. That’s not only risky, given that no vaccine is 100% effective, but disastrous for workers who can’t have the jab on medical grounds, including pregnant women for whom it isn’t universally recommended, and people suffering from various medical conditions. Yet this group, in turn, is entitled to protection from idiots who wilfully endanger them. If a pregnant woman would rather not share a desk with someone who refuses to get vaccinated for no good reason, should she be forced to? Is she entitled to ask, when she books a minicab, if the driver has had the jab? Does the freedom to go to the pub now come with a responsibility not to think yourself so young and invincible that you can’t be bothered rolling up a sleeve? Herd immunity alone isn’t going to guarantee the safe reopening of crowded theatres and packed nightclubs. Add the one in five people that it’s estimated may ultimately fail to get the jab to all those who legitimately can’t have it (including children, for whom it isn’t yet licensed), plus the unlucky few who may still catch Covid despite being vaccinated, and up to half the population might still be at risk this summer. That’s more than enough to keep the virus circulating and mutating. Yet making freedom conditional on facing the needle takes us perilously close to the concept of compulsory vaccination, forcing anxious people to accept something they don’t trust or else go underground – hardly likely to reassure anyone whose fear of the vaccine is bound up with a fear of an authoritarian state. So here are a few fundamental tests against which to judge Gove’s review. Any new scheme should only go with a targeted national effort to cajole, persuade and reassure those who are genuinely frightened. This effort should include trained staff going door to door in neighbourhoods where people are proving hard for vaccinators to reach. Any Covid certificate should carry test results as well as vaccine records, so that people who can’t or won’t get immunised can prove they’ve recently tested negative as an alternative, ensuring nobody is denied a social life because of a medical condition. Health and care professionals have a professional duty to get the vaccine but they’re a special case, and employers more broadly should not be given unprecedented powers of coercion that are open to abuse. Nobody should be refused public services – a school place, say, or a dentist’s appointment – for lack of a certificate. But none of us has a divine right to go to the pub, get on a plane or go out for dinner, and those who wilfully put others at risk must accept that antisocial choices can have consequences. For a year now, people around the world have accepted what would once have been unthinkable impositions in order to save the lives of strangers. Some have buried their parents without being able to hold a proper funeral, or given birth with nobody there to hold their hand. We have lived, grieved and marked milestones that will never come again while separated from those we love. Those sacrifices have been painful, but people’s willingness to make them has been a powerful reminder of the responsibility we feel towards each other, and showing up for a jab is the final step in that process. Those who refuse the vaccine have the right to do so. But they can’t be surprised if the world moves on, in small but life-affirming ways, without them.

118057,commentisfree/2021/feb/25/covid-climate-crisis-new-social-contract-old-young,Opinion,Covid and the climate crisis show why we need a new social contract between old and young | Minouche Shafik,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/25/covid-climate-crisis-new-social-contract-old-young,"Covid-19 continues to bring many inter-generational tensions to the fore. Older people bear the brunt of the disease’s impact on health; younger people have to make economic and social sacrifices to protect them. But the pandemic is just one reason why the social contract between the generations is under pressure. Within families, the social contract between the generations is easy to understand. Parents want to give their children the capabilities and means to have a good life; children want their parents to have a comfortable old age. But at a societal level, the social contract between the generations is more complex. The legacy we leave to future generations has many dimensions – the stock of human knowledge and culture, inventions, infrastructure and institutions, and the state of the natural world. We owe a great deal to previous generations and most would agree that we also owe something to future generations we will never meet, and that each generation should leave the next at least as well off, and preferably better off than they were. In many advanced economies, those born between the end of the second world war and the early 1960s benefited from decades of sustained economic growth, secure jobs with benefits and major gains in health and social conditions. The generations that followed have faced a world of more flexible and precarious work, rising house prices and a period of fiscal austerity after the 2008 financial crisis that reduced social spending in many countries. Many carry large debt burdens from student loans and credit cards, which limit their ability to afford a mortgage to buy a home, or start a family. The income gains and the prospect of security in old age experienced by past generations have stalled and, in some countries, reversed. The risks of poverty are shifting from older people to younger people. Today, there are many in advanced economies who believe the next generation will be worse off than their parents. Meanwhile, so-called Generation Z (those born after 2000) are at the forefront of the youth protest about the climate crisis. “You will die of old age; we will die of climate change,” read the sign of a young protester at the climate strike in London in September 2019. These young people are not convinced that older generations are doing enough to leave them with an inhabitable planet or viable livelihoods.
How, then, can we rebalance the social contract between the generations? The best way we can improve the economic prospects of future generations is through education. A massive investment in early years is the most effective way to equalise opportunity for all young people. Ideally, each young person would start with an educational endowment to enable to them to develop skills throughout their lives. More investment in re-skilling is also needed to enable people to adapt as jobs change over time. The resulting economic gains would also help pay for the elderly care needs of an ageing population and make debt more sustainable in the future. To reduce the fiscal burden on future generations, today’s older people will need to work longer. In most middle- and high-income countries, workers today can expect to spend about a third of their adult life in retirement. The basic problem is that the years in retirement relative to the years in work have grown too much. By 2060, all the G20 countries will have shrinking populations and the number of people over 65 who need to be supported by the working age population will have at least doubled. To avoid an undue burden on today’s young people, we need to link retirement ages explicitly to life expectancy, so that the ratio of time working and time in retirement comes into better balance. There must be a sensible way to finance social care that prevents destitution in old age and asks the better off to contribute. We must also do as much as we can to redress environmental damage. A good start would be to eliminate the $4-6 trillion in annual government subsidies to agriculture, water, fisheries and fossil fuels that actively encourage the exploitation of the environment. These subsidies mean it is not just free for companies to deplete the natural world, the taxpayer actually pays for them to do it. There needs to more investment in conservation and restoration of the biosphere, such as planting trees. Current public and private spending on conservation is about $91bn, less than 2% of what is spent on subsidies to degrade the environment. The next step is to measure things properly: where market prices do not convey the true value of environmental services, we must find other ways to factor them into our calculations and decisions. Finally, governments should use fiscal policy to change incentives, such as taxing carbon or incentivising green technologies.
Finding cohesion between the generations is complicated by the fact that older people tend to be more effective at exercising political power than young people. Research has shown that the share of older people in the population has a significant impact on the pattern of public spending. Put simply, more older people means more spending on pensions and less on education. Older voters are more averse to policies, such as low interest rates, that are intended to increase economic demand and maintain full employment but that lower returns on savings and risk more inflation. Having retired, they generally care less about unemployment, relative to the average citizen. Political parties in ageing societies are increasingly forced to cater to these demands. One way or another, we must find a way to give more weight to the voices and interests of younger and future generations. Otherwise the social contract that shapes the future will be designed exclusively by those who will not live to see it, without the input of those who will. Investing more in education and skills, finding ways to manage the costs of pensions, health and social care, and redressing environmental damage would be enlightened investments by one generation in the next: this would benefit all of us and provide a new social contract for our time. • Minouche Shafik is director of the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the author of What We Owe Each Other: A New Social Contract",2021-02-25 10:00:24+00:00,118058,2

A new variant of coronavirus could sweep across the globe and prove resistant to vaccines. If rising infection rates once again put intolerable pressure on hospitals then Boris Johnson would hit the pause button on the economy. But as things stand, the current lockdown will be the last. Every effort should be made to ensure this is the case because the costs of closing large chunks of the economy are enormous and are rising all the time. What’s more, the impact of the pandemic has widened Britain’s already gaping demographic, class and ethnic divides, and the risks of permanent scarring are obvious. The social costs of lockdowns – the impact on wellbeing – are just as significant as the economic costs (even though for many people the two are linked). As things stand, the chances of a further lockdown are happily quite slim. In part, that’s due to vaccines, in part it’s due to the fact that it would be a political disaster for the government if England’s “irreversible” march to freedom turned out to be reversible after all. But it is also because the willingness to comply with draconian restrictions on liberty is fraying. In my home town at the weekend, people were out with their friends in the mild weather. Although clearly all not from the same household, they were sitting on park benches, having a coffee together, chatting away merrily. A group of five young people had cracked open a couple of bottles of fizz.
People have got the message. Vaccines work and are starting to protect the most vulnerable, so now they want to get their lives back. That explains why there was a surge in holiday bookings as soon as the prime minister published his roadmap for ending restrictions by the summer. As it stands, in England the rules stipulate that two households are not to mix indoors until the middle of May at the earliest. Judging by the way people actually behave, many will not wait that long. Even so, the unlocking of the economy will be done in stages over the coming months because that’s the advice the government has received from its health and scientific experts. Some Tory MPs are unhappy with the gradual approach, but Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance will provide political cover to the prime minister if case numbers start to rise again. Ministers who have remained silent until now will say that Covid-19 is something a vaccinated country has to live with. One of those voices will be Rishi Sunak’s. Not a peep of protest has been heard from the chancellor during Britain’s winter hibernation but now the plans for the future have been published the focus – starting with next week’s budget – will shift to what is needed for economic recovery. Sunak accepted early on that the pressure on the NHS from the new variant of Covid-19 meant there was no realistic alternative to the current lockdown. His role has been to keep stumping up the money to pay for extra health spending, grants to businesses, temporary tax cuts and the wages of the millions of workers on furlough. Any temptation to start penny-pinching in the budget should be resisted. Having borrowed more in his first year in the job than any other chancellor in peacetime history, Sunak will need to carry on splashing the cash. For once Margaret Thatcher’s dictum is merited: there is no alternative. The chancellor will, of course, dress up his generosity with a warning that the government’s spending spree will have to end. There is talk that he may even announce an increase in corporation tax as a signal of intent, although with so many businesses struggling to survive he would be well advised not to levy it immediately. Deficit reduction can wait. The slow and steady pace at which restrictions will be lifted requires continued government support for the economy, even if the recovery turns out to be faster than expected. The reason for that is simple. While Sunak has managed to anaesthetise much of the pain from the lockdown, he has not been able to save every business or every job. Indeed, as the latest official numbers show, the number of payrolled employees has fallen by 726,000 since last February, with 425,000 of that total accounted for by people aged under 25. If the health effects of the pandemic have been felt most by elderly people, the economic pain has fallen disproportionately on the young, who tend to work in those sectors – hospitality, retail and leisure – that have been hit hardest by restrictions. As a result, Sunak has four big tasks next week. First, he has to make it clear that he will do whatever it takes to secure a sustainable recovery. Second, he needs to commit extra resources to ensure that there will be sufficient capacity in the NHS to cope should there be a resurgence of the pandemic next winter. Third, he needs to show some tender loving care to the tens of thousands of small businesses hanging on by their fingertips after a year in which cashflow has dried up but costs have continued to mount. Targeted support to the hospitality industry would help limit job losses among the young, But some businesses are still going to fail because spending patterns have changed during the pandemic, and that means workers will need to be redeployed from one sector to another. So, fourth, Sunak, needs to increase spending on job support, retraining and apprenticeships for those coming out of school and college. Few budgets really matter. Most of the ones that live in the memory do so for the wrong reasons. Sunak must ensure this one is different. Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor",2021-02-24 15:36:35+00:00,118212,2
118236,commentisfree/2021/feb/24/eu-covid-vaccination-difficulties-anti-vaxxers,Opinion,Why is the EU running into so many difficulties with its Covid vaccine campaign? | Leo Cendrowicz,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/24/eu-covid-vaccination-difficulties-anti-vaxxers,"Vaccines are a medical marvel. They are credited with saving more lives than any other human innovation after clean water. The astonishingly rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines should be celebrated as a triumph of ingenuity. And yet many Europeans are shunning the shots. These vaccine sceptics are endangering their neighbours, undermining the recovery and exposing an awkward European anti-science strain. The EU’s vaccine rollout was already stuttering last month when delays in deliveries of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs meant the bloc only administered a fraction of its planned inoculations. If that was a misfortune, the latest vaccine crisis looks more like carelessness. While deliveries are still sluggish, take-up of available AstraZeneca doses is pitiful. Many people are skipping scheduled vaccine appointments, hoping for Pfizer shots instead. Almost unbelievably, scepticism is highest among healthcare workers. The resistance to AstraZeneca is particularly fierce in Germany, where just 187,000 of the 1.5 million available shots had been used by the end of last week. While Germany’s top vaccines agency, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, confirmed anecdotal reports of occasional side-effects, such as shivers or fever, it nonetheless says the vaccine is highly effective and describes reactions to it as short-lived. Part of the hesitancy is down to recent politics. Last month’s unseemly spat between the European commission and AstraZeneca over the delayed deliveries stirred up antipathy towards the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the case, by publicly trashing the firm, the commission undermined trust in the vaccines.
This was compounded by confusion over the AstraZeneca vaccine’s efficacy. Many national regulators limited the jab to under-65s, citing a lack of trial data – even though the European Medicines Agency approved it last month for all adults. That caution nonetheless stoked doubt on the vaccine’s safety. The risks were then misrepresented in German media, and later by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. However, a good chunk of the vaccine scepticism is down to deeper cultural, social and political reasons. Europe has a long and ignoble anti-vaxxer tradition, which is often fuelled by anti-establishment politics. Even though Europe dominates the global vaccine industry, including the Covid-19 shots, vaccines are widely distrusted. A 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor survey showed that only 59% of people in western Europe thought vaccines were safe, compared with 79% worldwide. When it came to levels of distrust, France was highest, with about 33% saying vaccines were unsafe; this compared with 22% in western Europe and 17% in eastern Europe. The consequences were already clear before coronavirus. Childhood vaccination rates were falling across the EU, risking the return of preventable diseases. The EU recognised the problem, setting up the European Joint Action on Vaccination project to work on a standard protocol for responding to an outbreak alert from another country. Before being confirmed as European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen promised to “prioritise communication on vaccination, explaining the benefits and combating the myths, misconceptions and scepticism that surround the issue”. Her predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, blamed “stupid mistrust” of vaccines for deaths from preventable diseases and warned that those refusing immunisations were “playing with fire”. But since healthcare policy is overseen by national governments rather than the EU, Brussels is only a cheerleader for national vaccine policies. A 2018 report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found only 10 of 16 countries had an immunisation information system to record the reasons people gave for not vaccinating. Why, more than two centuries after Edward Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine, are so many Europeans sceptical about vaccines? A 2019 Eurobarometer survey shed some light on this issue. It found that about 48% of people in the EU believed that vaccines could often produce serious side-effects, 38% thought they could cause the diseases against which they protect, and 31% were convinced that they could weaken the immune system. All these beliefs are incorrect. Prof Heidi Larson, who runs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, says vaccine scepticism is bound up with more general anxieties about the world and our place in it. In Europe, its insidious rise is fuelled by disinformation and amplified by social media. The extraordinary nature of the coronavirus pandemic has generated a new strain of conspiracy theories. Enforced isolation, insecurity and uncertainty have fed into Facebook stories about Bill Gates slipping microchips into vaccine shots. Political upheaval also drives fringe views – and the EU has seen its fair share of that in recent years. Trust in science is linked to trust in institutions such as government. The drift towards extreme, anti-establishment politics includes populists who rant about the evils of vaccines. This was the case in Italy, where the two biggest political parties, the far-right Lega and leftist Five Star Movement, both stoked fearmongering about vaccines. France may be the country of immunology pioneer Louis Pasteur, but it has a raging anti-vax movement, tied to Marine Le Pen on the right and Jean-Luc Mélenchon on the left. Ministers and officials across the EU are now pleading with people to accept the AstraZeneca vaccine if it is offered. The German health minister, Jens Spahn, last week said it was a “privilege” to be offered an injection with the “safe and effective” AstraZeneca jab. The French health minister, Olivier Véran, got the jab live on television. People in Belgium have been warned against “vaccine shopping”: they will not be allowed to choose which jab is offered. But even if the EU’s vaccine campaign gets back on track, this crisis has exposed long-term challenges. For too long, European leaders have failed to confront anti-vax sentiment, allowing dangerous ideas to fester. This has fed casual conspiracy theories about big pharma and global elites, undermining confidence in modern medicine, science and technology. And it means a life-saving vaccine is being snubbed, despite all the evidence of its efficacy.

In the coming months, the days will become lighter and warmer, and a population that has been through the most severe national emergency since the second world war will be ever freer. Playgrounds will fill with laughing children, rounds will be bought in pubs and friends will hug. As the “before times” come roaring back, the relief will fuse with a desire to scrub the nightmare away from our collective consciousness, and leave it to the history books and future Netflix dramas to unpick. It should not be either/or: an embrace of our belatedly returned freedoms should not lead to a failure to hold our rulers to account. Covid-19 represents a chain reaction of crises: a public health crisis which triggered an economic crisis and, in turn, a social crisis. What beckons now is a democratic crisis: the failure to hold a government to account for its catastrophic handling of a pandemic and its abdication of that most sacred responsibility, to protect its people from harm and danger. Once this seal is breached, how does accountability – without which there is no functioning democracy – survive? What possible scandal will ever be grave enough to warrant far-reaching political consequences? As the government seeks credit for the triumphant success of the NHS’s mass vaccination programme, let us recap what it has done. From the very start, Conservative strategy was to prioritise economic interests over human life: a calamity on its own terms, which left us simultaneously with one of the world’s worst death tolls and recessions – because it was always the virus that threatened our economy the most. Years of austerity left Britain with depleted personal protective equipment (PPE) stocks and the government failed to build up testing capacity even as the virus left China’s shores. While health experts such as Prof Anthony Costello warned that “every day of delay will kill”, the government briefed journalists that it would pursue herd immunity and allow the virus to run rampant. The government finally U-turned, but no other major European country entered lockdown with infections so high. An underfunded and under-resourced NHS with 40,000 nursing vacancies was expected to pick up the pieces, while the government was reduced to paying extortionate prices for PPE, some of which was unusable. Vulnerable hospital patients were discharged without Covid tests en masse into care homes. Arrivals from abroad were not tested or quarantined. Multimillion-pound contracts were splashed on private companies with links to the Conservative party. Instead of building up local capacity, billions were spent on a centralised and privatised test-and-trace system in England which repeatedly failed to meet its targets. When the economy was prematurely reopened – including encouraging people to eat in confined indoor spaces through the farce of “eat out to help out” – it was without a properly functioning test-and-trace system. Schools and universities were reopened without sufficient precautionary measures, overriding prescient warnings from trade unions. Sage’s call for a circuit breaker lockdown to prevent “catastrophe” in September was vetoed, with a U-turn only coming at the end of October, when infections were spiralling out of control. Boris Johnson mocked opponents for wanting to “cancel Christmas” and encouraged festive family mixing before doing another U-turn. The death rate over the past two months speaks to an incredibly grim and poorly managed winter.
In a healthy democracy, this series of disasters, which caused Britain to suffer the worst death rate anywhere in the world except the small nations of Czech Republic, Slovenia and Belgium, would have toppled the government. Was Neville Chamberlain’s premiership not destroyed less than a year into the war as the fall of Norway underscored the government’s disastrous record? And yet all the signs are that Johnson’s administration will simply get away with it. How? The first culprit, of course, is a supine press which often sees its fundamental role as holding the government’s opponents to account. Our broadcast media, too, acquiesced to the government’s herd immunity strategy by failing to sufficiently and stridently question why ministers were pursuing a policy that seemingly left Britain an outlier – and often failed to adequately criticise the government’s subsequent failings. Then there is the official opposition, which seems to have abdicated the responsibilities that are rather heavily implied by that title. An opposition that cannot even call for the health secretary’s resignation when a court finds he has acted unlawfully opens itself up to the charge of having essentially given up. By failing to tell a story about why Britain has almost uniquely suffered in the pandemic – unlike the Tories, who weaved a clever but false narrative about why public spending was responsible for the 2008 financial crash – they have left much of the population believing the government did its best with the hand it was dealt, and instead blaming the public for soaring infections. A directionless Labour party is failing to pin responsibility for Britain’s worst peacetime disaster on the government, and weakening our democracy as a consequence. So yes, sunshine and freedom beckons: our collective joy is deserved and overdue. But nearly one in every 500 of us died in this pandemic. In the years to come, our economy will recover. It is an open question whether our democracy will. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",2021-02-24 10:45:52+00:00,118252,2

The unveiling of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of social restrictions was accompanied by a glimpse of how they might play out in a Covid context. As people rushed to bet on the possibility of taking a foreign holiday in July or August, easyJet was among the top risers on the FTSE 250 on Tuesday, reporting a 337% leap in bookings. Shares in the long-suffering hospitality and entertainment industries jumped too. Vaccine rollout and the prime minister’s roadmap have understandably persuaded the population that a definitive exit from lockdown purdah is at hand. For its part, the government, quite reasonably, believes that the release of pent-up consumer energy will fuel a significant post-pandemic recovery. Last week’s UK consumer confidence index was sufficiently buoyant to lead analysts to talk of a “return to normality” in the coming year. Such speculation is both plausible and dangerous. Animal spirits and consumer confidence will not be enough to repair the deep structural damage wrought on millions of people’s lives by the pandemic. Without government intervention lasting far beyond the summer, there is a danger that two nations will emerge from this coronavirus nightmare: one driving an economic boom as it spends some of the savings accrued over 15 months of enforced hibernation; the other blighted by debt, unemployment, unaffordable rent arrears, and, in communities where vaccination take-up has been lower, a continuing risk of Covid. According to recent data, household savings are up by about 10% compared to a year ago. But low-paid families have seen their income squeezed and the number forced into actual destitution has doubled to half a million. An estimated three-quarters of a million renters are behind on payments. Tuesday’s unemployment figures, which did not reflect the 1 million or so self-employed currently without work, recorded a rise to 5.1%, up 1.5% from a year ago. But the true damage done to businesses will not be known until the furlough scheme is removed, when as many as one in 10 may find themselves jobless. The government is gambling that an inevitable rise in infections, as a result of easing restrictions, can be dealt with through existing vaccines. A new variant could confound those hopes. Clearly though, it will be a cause for relief and celebration when restaurants are safely booked up every night, young people are back in nightclubs and city centres are buzzing again. The UK economy, overly reliant on consumer-led growth, desperately requires the shot of adrenaline that the return of good times will bring. But when that time comes, those unable to join the party, through no fault of their own, cannot be abandoned to their post-Covid fate. Louise Casey, Mr Johnson’s former adviser on homelessness, has called for a new, Beveridge-style royal commission to address the needs of the 25% or so of the population who, she says, have been “badly wounded” by the pandemic. Thus far, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s grudging extensions of furlough and other measures, such as the £20 universal credit uplift, suggest the Treasury is champing at the bit to move in precisely the opposite direction. Better times, hopefully, are not too far away. But in them, the government has a moral duty to reflect the spirit of solidarity that emerged last spring, as neighbours looked out for each other and low-paid key workers were clapped on doorsteps. In the dismal, divided landscape of Benjamin Disraeli’s famous novel, Sybil, the rich and the poor resemble two nations, as if they were “dwellers in different zones or inhabitants of different planets.” That must not be allowed to become Britain’s post-Covid reality; a world where golf courses, cinemas and budget airlines are packed, but so too are the nation’s food banks.",2021-02-23 19:05:26+00:00,118373,67
118508,commentisfree/2021/feb/23/easing-lockdown-covid-risks-ventilation-isolation,Opinion,Easing lockdown will allow Covid to spread. Here's how to mitigate the risks | Sam Bowman,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/23/easing-lockdown-covid-risks-ventilation-isolation,"The government’s roadmap for ending Covid restrictions in England commits it to steps that may increase the rate at which the virus spreads. Some of that is unavoidable. But even as we reopen, there is more that we could do to mitigate the risk, and get us to the summer – and normality – without a resurgence. One reason that east Asian countries have done better during the pandemic is that prior experience with Sars has given people the understanding of how respiratory diseases spread, and how to avoid them. Japan’s three Cs guidance – avoidance of closed spaces, crowded places, and conversations – helped it avoid a serious epidemic without imposing a national lockdown. But the UK’s messaging still prioritises hand washing, surface cleaning and 2-metre distancing, and there has been no public education campaign about ventilation on the scale of last year’s hand-washing campaign. The guidance downplays the fact that Covid mostly spreads through the air, and emphasises the risk of surface spread, which does not seem to be a major transmission mechanism. Polling done last month suggests that many people do not realise that opening windows is one of the best ways to avoid catching the disease, and do not think this has been emphasised by the government. Schools are due to reopen fully on 8 March, and are the first significant risk in the government’s plans. Although children rarely show symptoms of Covid, they can still catch and spread it asymptomatically. The main danger from schools is not that children themselves will get sick, or even give it to their teachers. It is that they will catch Covid at home, bring it to school, and infect their classmates, who will then bring it home to their families, all asymptomatically. According to Sage, children aged 12–16 were nearly seven times more likely than older family members to be the first infection in their household. They were also twice as likely as older people to pass the virus on to another family member after being infected. Successive studies have indicated that school closures led to big reductions in transmission and Covid mortality, and are one of the most effective non-pharmaceutical interventions we have against Covid. So reopening all at once could mean case numbers begin to rise again suddenly, and in a way that is politically difficult to reverse. Phasing in school reopenings gradually, with younger school groups brought in first, would allow us to monitor the effect that reopenings have on cases and change course on other age groups if necessary. Allowing parents who are not comfortable with sending their children back to delay their return would reduce the rate of spread as well. The new advice will require secondary school children to wear masks in classrooms, but primary school children will not, even though those children can still contract and spread the virus. The new advice for schools is better on ventilation than the previous advice, but still emphasises hand-washing and surface spread ahead of that. Requiring masks for children of all ages (as other countries have), and giving support to help with ventilation, like distributing CO2 monitors to measure fresh air in classrooms, could help to reduce the virus’s spread in schools. At this time of year, this will make it cold in classrooms: as well as relaxing school uniform rules so children can wrap up warmly, as the new advice allows, the government could take on schools’ heating bills until the summer, including allowing for extra heaters to be rented in older buildings. Schools should be instructed to make every possible effort to reduce indoor class numbers. Where possible, unused offices and other empty spaces near schools could be hired and staffed temporarily, at the government’s expense (recruitment of newly qualified teachers was down sharply last year, so some may be available, along with supply teachers hired full-time). This, and giving more time to outdoor play and instruction when the weather permits, could allow classes to be divided up into smaller groups, so that when outbreaks do arise, the number of children exposed is kept to a minimum. Obviously, not all of these steps will be possible for every school. But every extra precaution any school takes reduces the risk for the whole country. The reopening of businesses will bring dangers, too. Throughout lockdown, many estate agents have been open, with staff sitting in high street offices, maskless, under the impression that sitting two metres from each other makes things “safe”. That may have helped to spread Covid and meant that this lockdown has been longer than it needed to be. And when more businesses reopen that problem will grow. Allowing pubs and restaurants to initially reopen for outdoor service only is a good idea, and they should be given street space and car parking spaces by local councils for seating. But minimising indoor spread has to be extended to other businesses as well. Unventilated spaces are dangers as long as Covid is present, even with plastic barriers and distancing between customers. The “Covid secure” meme has to die. On top of this, we’ll need to give adequate support to people told to self-isolate, so those told to isolate actually do it and the testing we do is worth something. And if we can get cases low enough, forwards and backwards contact tracing might let us stem new outbreaks as we detect them. The UK’s vaccination programme has been miraculous. But we still have tens of millions of people left to protect, and if the virus comes back before that, a vaccine-resistant variant could emerge that sets us back by months, and requires another lockdown. If we can make it to the summer, then the seasonal fall in cases combined with the vaccines could allow us to get back to normal for good. It would be crazy not to do everything we can to get there safely.

One might be forgiven for experiencing a sense of deja vu. Mr Johnson has been here twice before. This time was different. There were no jokes about ordering a pint to celebrate. It pays to be humble in the face of nature, a chastened prime minister acknowledged. With more than 120,000 Covid-19 deaths in the UK, it is about time that Mr Johnson was serious about coronavirus. His decision to ease restrictions is a reflection of the belief in the apparent early success of the vaccines in reducing hospitalisations and deaths, and their rapid deployment. This has given him the confidence to rebuff calls from Tory MPs to lift the lockdown more quickly. Mr Johnson’s approach is to roll back restrictions in stages, starting with outdoor meetings, with a five-week wait between phases. If things go awry then, Mr Johnson says, further liberalisation can be put off. The prime minister has devised a plan that gives him maximum flexibility. Mr Johnson says he is prepared to reverse the relaxation of measures should one of four thresholds be breached – but he has not specified these levels. His plan is more dates than data. Duncan Robertson at Loughborough University points out that in September last year, when government scientists on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) called for a circuit break, there were 20 people aged over 85 per 100,000 being admitted to hospital with Covid. When the last lockdown was announced, the comparable number was 297. Sage’s closest forecast to Mr Johnson’s bespoke scheme projects that the UK is likely to see a resurgence of the virus around September. The protection afforded by the current vaccines, Mr Johnson told MPs, will by then have replaced the restrictions. If all goes well, the UK could be free of all restrictions by 21 June. By the end of July, every adult ought to have been offered a jab. This would be a very good outcome. But that seems a long way away. Mr Johnson’s logic is that cases of coronavirus will increase. But he hopes this will not translate into people needing treatment or rising Covid fatalities, and that the NHS will not be put under “unsustainable” pressure. However, the more we allow infections to rise and the virus to replicate, the greater the chance that new variants will arrive that have the ability to dodge our current vaccines. The variant that’s dominating in South Africa – B1351 – has displayed such nightmarish attributes. We should therefore employ a very cautious approach, and Mr Johnson must think hard about whether his plan to reopen schools is wise. In a fortnight, all children in England will return to school. By contrast, the devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are much more cautious. It would surely be better not to allow an uncontrolled spread in younger people, even if more vulnerable and older adults have been vaccinated. A children’s vaccine won’t be ready for months, so the threat is a real one. Without a test, trace and isolate system, it will be almost impossible to contain infections, especially if a variant emerges that is vaccine-resistant. The half-baked quarantine scheme is unlikely to prevent variants being imported from abroad. The government’s silence on preventing viral transmission in schools and offices is telling. Squashing a virus before it evolves to escape vaccines entirely is the best option. Mr Johnson is wagering that the current vaccines are a magic bullet, and that coronavirus becomes an endemic disease like the flu, which gives rise to large numbers of infections in winter, but is more bothersome than deadly. This is a gamble. Would it not be better to insure against the worst outcome by stamping out the virus with a zero-Covid strategy? The answer is surely yes, prime minister.",2021-02-22 19:34:57+00:00,118589,67
118643,commentisfree/2021/feb/22/england-covid-roadmap-lockdown-experts-view,Opinion,Is England's Covid roadmap the right way out of lockdown? The experts' view,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/22/england-covid-roadmap-lockdown-experts-view,"Devi Sridhar: We should be treating Covid-19 like measles, not flu
Boris Johnson appears to have finally learned a lesson about the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering. The government’s roadmap for easing the lockdown allows for flexibility and is guided by the data rather than the dates. But there are still difficult problems to overcome. Until 80% to 90% of the population has been vaccinated, a large percentage of people will still be susceptible to infection and hospitalisation, giving the virus plenty of opportunities to spread and strain the NHS. If England is to break the cycle of continuous lockdowns, it should learn a lesson from Israel: vaccines can be an effective way to suppress the virus, but only when they are also rolled out to younger age groups. Prominent voices – including that of the health secretary – have told us that Covid-19 will become a seasonal infection, much like flu. But our public health approach should be more akin to measles. The UK should be aiming to suppress and eliminate Covid-19 through vaccines, mass testing and supported isolation. After we’ve achieved this, the UK should then help poorer countries in their vaccination efforts. Unlike the early days of the pandemic, you will now find very few people advocating for the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 (the so-called “herd immunity” approach). The real shame is that such voices ever had any influence over the government’s pandemic response. Over the past 12 months, Britain has lost almost 130,000 lives to Covid-19. Had the government pursued a zero-Covid approach from the start, following the example of countries like Australia, far fewer people would have died. In the end, England seems to be on its way out of this pandemic, saved by vaccines and seasonal change. Outdoor transmission is a minimal risk, so it makes sense for the government to lift restrictions on outdoor socialising first. In fact, Scotland has allowed under-12s to play in small groups outdoors since July. This would be an easy win for England and other countries, too. The imminent risk now is the full return of schools on 8 March leading to uncontrolled transmission. Scotland has taken a different approach, allowing younger primary students to go back on 22 February, followed by other students over the coming weeks in a phased process, as the impact on transmission is monitored and analysed. Again, England’s roadmap must be driven by data and science, and not by the loudest voices in the room. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Jennifer Dowd: The approach to Covid-19 in schools is one of dangerous exceptionalism
Many parents in England will have heaved a sigh of relief that schools are due to reopen on 8 March. But aside from testing pupils on a twice-weekly basis, ministers have offered no further detail on how transmission in schools will be prevented as part of the government’s roadmap for easing lockdown. As with many aspects of our pandemic response, England’s approach to Covid-19 in schools seems one of dangerous exceptionalism. While there have been many spirited debates about the precise role that schools play in helping Covid-19 spread, two things are indisputable. First, schools bring people into prolonged physical contact with one another, talking and breathing indoors. Second, Covid-19 is spread primarily through aerosols that spread better in unventilated environments. Pretending that the rules of physics and biology somehow don’t apply in classrooms risks undoing the difficult sacrifices of lockdown. To ensure the reopening of schools doesn’t bring the R number back above 1, England must put basic mitigation measures in place. Masks should be mandated in classrooms, and schools should be better ventilated. Opening doors and windows can have a significant impact on reducing the accumulation of aerosols. Where that’s not possible, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can make a big difference at a relatively low cost. Kids of all ages around the world are wearing masks in school this year. The same should be the case in England. Arguing that masks inhibit classroom learning when the alternative is sending students home to self-isolate, or closing schools altogether, defies common sense. Alone, each of these measures is imperfect. But taken together, they can have a significant effect on the rate of transmission. Mask-wearing in schools need not be perfect, and individual exceptions can be made. Unfortunately, we will never know how many Covid-19 cases and deaths in England could have been avoided if these basic school mitigation measures had been put in place last September. To ensure this lockdown really is the last one, we should not make the same mistake twice. Jennifer Dowd is a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford Graham Medley: The government’s gradual timeline seems sensible
During an epidemic there are only two directions a virus can take: up or down. If the R number is above 1, the virus is going to spread, and if it is below 1, the virus will decrease. At the moment, the UK’s epidemic is decreasing but we know it could double in size in a couple of weeks if transmission picks up again. Despite the progress made in driving down cases during the lockdown, we’re only a month away from being back in the same position as we were in December. This is why a careful, measured approach to easing restrictions is sensible. The government’s roadmap proposes a gradual timeline for easing restrictions that will occur in four separate phases, with the final constraints lifted by no earlier than 21 June. Of course, things are not the same as they were in 2020. We now have a vaccine, which we are deploying at a remarkable rate. There are two things that control the rate of transmission of a virus – the amount of contact between people, and the proportion of those people who are susceptible to infection. When these two things are at their highest levels, the R number for this virus is about 3. A year ago we were all susceptible to the virus, as there were no vaccines available and nobody had been exposed to Covid-19 before, so reducing contact was the only way to make R smaller. Now, with more than one-third of the population estimated to be immune to the virus, the maximum R can get to is 2, and fewer restrictions will be needed to keep R below 1. But timing is everything. If the amount of social contact increases faster than susceptibility decreases, then transmission could dramatically increase. If susceptibility goes down faster, and lockdown measures are prolonged, then we will be unnecessarily restricting people’s lives and livelihoods. Balancing the amount of social contact with the speed of the vaccine rollout will allow us to exit the epidemic with minimal damage from now on. This will not be the end of Covid-19, and there will be more twists in the tale. But the next few months will be a key step in learning how to live with it. Graham Medley is a professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and chairs the Sage sub-group on pandemic modelling Stephen Reicher: A coherent and sustainable long-term strategy is still missing
After a year during which the government responded to rising infections too slowly and lifted restrictions too quickly, Boris Johnson has promised that, this time, the easing of lockdown will be “cautious but irreversible”. In some ways, the government’s new roadmap for lifting England’s third lockdown looks very different to previous attempts. There will be no sudden reopening of the economy, and people will only be allowed to mix indoors in the third phase of the roadmap, which will be introduced no earlier than 17 May. But in other respects, this roadmap throws caution to the wind. Opening schools in one go hardly seems like a prudent decision. On this issue, the government could have learned from countries such as Norway, which has adopted a “traffic light” system: in areas with higher levels of infection, children return to school for some of the time to allow for social distancing, and multiple safeguards are still in place. As infections fall, these restrictions are lifted. The answer to whether this roadmap will ensure an “irreversible” lifting of restrictions is again found in the detail. The best way to irreversibly lift restrictions is to enforce other measures that can drive down infections when the lockdown is lifted. Vaccinations are clearly one of those measures, but for now at least, they are insufficient on their own. England still urgently needs an improved test-and-trace system in order to identify new cases and variants. The government needs to provide adequate resources to people who are self-isolating, rather than simply instructing them to do so. England must find ways to make schools, workplaces and restaurants safer, with a common set of standards for what makes a place Covid-safe. And we need to properly control our borders, with robust isolation policies in place for people arriving from countries where variants are unknown. In short, we need a coherent and sustainable long-term strategy to suppress Covid-19. That has always been missing. It still is.

118677,commentisfree/2021/feb/22/uk-government-claiming-success-covid-vaccine-failures,Opinion,"The UK government is claiming every success for itself, while blaming us for its failures | Zoe Williams",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/22/uk-government-claiming-success-covid-vaccine-failures,"It’s magnificent, isn’t it, to find oneself ahead of a deadline? At current rates, the 32 million people in the top nine priority groups in the UK will be offered a first jab by 4 April, ahead of the 30 April deadline. The government is now also expecting all adults to be offered their first jab by 31 July, two months ahead of the previous target of September. There are a few conclusions to draw from this: the most important is that everyone involved in vaccination, from the scientists developing it and the regulators pushing it through to the NHS staff delivering it, the volunteer stewards and the people getting vaccinated, lifting morale with their ear-to-ear beaming, have done something collective and tremendous. Yet in the spirit of chewing gum and walking at the same time, it’s possible to applaud the effort while also noting that the targets have been set deliberately low so they might be exceeded at every turn. It’s the one solitary piece of wisdom 2020 has gifted to the party of government: stop making stupid promises you can’t keep. Make underambition your watchword, then stand back and enjoy the fireworks of delight as every week is better than you predicted. It is in this spirit that we should understand this week’s roadmap for England, such a masterwork of underpromising that it feels as though they’ve overdelivered already. Pre-briefed to almost every newspaper, we don’t even have the anxiety of surprise. Schools in England go back on 8 March: considering that the last concrete information on this was at the end of January, when ministers were “hoping” that schools “might” be back after Easter, this already looks like a government sailing past a personal best. Tennis and golf, low salience, high festivity events, may resume at the same time. Outdoor mixing, non-essential shopping and self-catering holidays may be allowed by Easter, indoor entertainment sometime in May, indoor household mixing by June. Boris Johnson reserves the right to “slam the brakes on”, says the Sun, if the R number, hospital admissions, vaccination numbers or mortality rates disappoint: given the glacial pace of these changes, “slamming” seems like a strong word. The game plan Johnson has landed upon is that he’ll look at “data not dates”, thereby introducing an element of elasticity entirely at odds with the concept of a roadmap. Framed as deference to science, the announcement has it all: respectability, flexibility, unaccountability. Above all, it turns spring and summer into one long advent calendar; every week, we open some new door to a joy we didn’t dare to imagine, having been promised nothing but maybes. As tactics go, it’s like offering a toddler two choices, putting the one you want them to make second. Just in the sense that it’s weird how well it works. Traces of the original prime minister remain – he solemnly undertakes, for instance, that this lockdown will be the last. Yet there has been a clear change of tack, away from boosterish certainty that characterised the government’s handling of the pandemic until now. There are two factors at play here: one specific, one general. The departure of Dominic Cummings ushered in a new normal, away from sheer audacity – say whatever you like in the moment that might keep people happy, everyone’s an idiot anyway – towards a more old-school professional managerialism, such as you might recognise from an oncologist or a surveyor. The situation is grave, and everything will not be fine; yet these sequential steps will be taken, and within the variables of each one’s success, we can guess the range of the timescale. This tends more towards pleasant surprise than hideous disappointment.
In more general terms, the combination of the vaccine’s success and the shockingly steep climb of the second wave has sealed something in the public mood that was already palpable by the autumn: there is an abiding sense that, whatever mistakes have been made, whatever corruption uncovered, whatever short-sightedness and flakiness you could reasonably charge the government with, this is a dire situation that no mortal could have judged perfectly. None of us would wish the stewardship of this crisis on our worst enemy: that fact alone has created a mournful mood of fair play that the government has grasped with both hands, to make itself the victim of the disaster rather than its architect. Truthfully, it was always both. So the government talks of not playing politics with Covid, of listening only to impartial science, but in fact its approach is deeply political: every triumph it claims for itself, every failure belongs to all of us. Privatise the wins, socialise the losses; it is not an unfamiliar strategy, although it is a bit bracing to see it adapted so seamlessly from one crisis to another. In fact, there is a much more important roadmap to discuss than when we will once again see the inside of a gym: how do people’s livelihoods recover? How do decimated sectors rebuild? It is past the point of mattering whether pubs will open in April or May: what matters now is how businesses, and people, that have been brought to the brink of economic destruction can be nursed back to health. Johnson has chosen a stance of affable impotence; it looks like a smart move in the short term, yet it offers huge opportunity for the opposition that can generate a sense of agency. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",2021-02-22 13:58:02+00:00,118678,2

He kicked off with the claim that he was actually 84. On the one hand, you have to believe a man about his own date of birth, and it would be a wild time for him to start lying about his age. On the other hand, if a family can’t lose 20 minutes on whether a man is sure he means 1937, not 1936, those aren’t relatives at all; those are more like friends. Then we had to do it all again, because my brothers joined late. They have a chimpy dominance thing where whoever is the latest is the mighty silverback. It meant, as ever, that we had to go through key details again for each new arrival, so by the end my uncle had been vaccinated six times. He is the only double-vaccinated person on his street, the only one any of us has met. I am relieved about that; when I last spoke to him, only the Pfizer jab had been cleared and he wanted to hold out for the cheaper one. He knew it was free at the point of delivery – he is not a baby. He is just a man with an eye for a bargain. Sick of the sight of my own fringe, I left abruptly and called him later to put the finishing touches on my salutations. “I hate those Zooms,” he said, after a bit of preamble about how nice it was to see everyone. “I can’t stand the sight of my own face.” This made no sense to me, even though I feel exactly the same way. He is the least vain person I have met: he used to keep his extracted molars in his pocket so he could wow the crowd with a joke about still having all his own teeth. “I look in the mirror once a day, when I wake up. I’ve never looked in the mirror for 40 minutes in my life.” Yup. Same. “And the gesticulation! Why do I do all these stupid things with my hands?” “It feels like you’re being a little hard on yourself,” I told him. I have realised, finally, nearly a year in, that vanity and never having signed up to look in a mirror for 40 minutes are two different concepts, each of which need a word of their own.

118858,commentisfree/2021/feb/21/uk-lockdown-health-livelihoods-2021-sage-committee,Opinion,This UK lockdown must be the last. Here's how we can achieve that | Susan Michie,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/uk-lockdown-health-livelihoods-2021-sage-committee,"As the UK has yo-yoed in and out of multiple lockdowns, restrictions have harmed people’s livelihoods, businesses, mental and physical health, and their quality of life. In the first and second lockdowns, these restrictions proved insufficient to permanently drive down the prevalence of Covid-19. This time, we have been promised that all adults will have received their first vaccine dose by July – but its level of effectiveness, coupled with the potential emergence of new strains of the virus, means the vaccine rollout will not be a complete solution to the pandemic. Roadmaps for easing restrictions across the devolved nations – with England’s due to be published on Monday – should be focused on avoiding the mistakes of the past 12 months. The UK must learn from what has worked in other countries that are now successfully returning to everyday life, such as Australia, New Zealand, China, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam and Finland. They locked down early and hard, driving down transmission until it reached a level that could be managed by an effective system of test, trace and supported isolation. Just because the UK hasn’t followed this strategy previously, doesn’t mean it can’t start now. We shouldn’t throw away the gains of the past few weeks, achieved through considerable hardship and sacrifice, by lifting restrictions before we can keep the virus in check. Opening up too early risks overwhelming the NHS, increasing the likelihood of new variants emerging that could evade vaccines, and creating a backlog of non-Covid conditions that must be treated.
The plans should focus on three things: maintaining short-term lockdown measures until infection rates are brought down to a manageable level; lifting restrictions according to the data available, rather than according to the date; and enforcing long-term measures that will be necessary to keep Covid-19 under control in the future. The overarching aim should be maintaining minimal cases of Covid-19 (a level of about 10 new cases per 100,000 people a week, for example, might be judged low enough). In the short term, we face a trade-off. The longer the government keeps current restrictions in place, the faster we will drive down case numbers and be able to lift restrictions. There is still much room for improvement in the current lockdown. According to polling by the Trades Union Congress, one in five employees are going into workplaces unnecessarily when they could be working from home. We still do not have a well-functioning test, trace and supported isolation system, and many of those who must self-isolate are offered no financial or practical assistance. Our borders are leaky: although those arriving from countries on a “red list” must quarantine in a managed hotel for 10 days, people are still arriving from countries where variants are unknown. The question of when to lift restrictions isn’t just about what the science says. It involves value judgments about what kind of society we want to live in, who should influence decision-making and what areas we want to prioritise. The decision should therefore be based on both scientific advice and public engagement, and restrictions should be lifted at a pace to allow continual review and adjustment if needed. The consensus is that schools should be one of the first settings to have restrictions eased, but recent modelling suggests this will need to be done very carefully if the R value is not to be increased. One way of doing this would be repurposing unused spaces to create “Nightingale” schools where children are able to learn in a safe and socially distant way, reducing crowding in existing classrooms, and calling on former teachers who have left the profession to help. In addition, we could use blended learning, combining classroom and at-home education to reduce the amount of social mixing in schools. This would require ensuring that everyone has internet connectivity and laptops or tablets.
The UK will need the capacity to undertake widespread testing, assimilated into a functioning test, trace and isolate system. This system should be based in local public health organisations and primary care, and coordinated by the NHS – which has had huge success in organising the vaccination programme. Doing this will mean diverting resources away from failed commercial contracts and towards local authorities and those with the expertise and trust to deliver a comprehensive system. Meanwhile, as the vaccination programme is extended to the entire population, regular boosters will be needed to fight new variants, and skilled engagement with groups of people who may be hesitant about receiving the jab will be required. In the longer term, we should establish “green zones” – areas where the virus has been judged to be under control, where there is no danger of infection and thus no need for restrictions. We’ll need a new system for accrediting Covid-safe environments, from workplaces to schools, shops, hospitality and transport, as we do with hygiene ratings for restaurants. This will require robust guidance, support, regulations and inspections to ensure that all public spaces meet agreed safety standards, with publicly displayed certificates and a hotline for reporting breaches. Finally, as the UK slowly recovers from Covid-19, one of politicians’ chief priorities should be to address the inequalities that helped the virus to spread. During the pandemic, people in precarious and low-paid jobs, those in deprived communities, people from minority-ethnic backgrounds women and people in poor housing have suffered disproportionately. Fixing this is possible – but as with driving down Covid-19, it requires political will.

118893,commentisfree/2021/feb/21/boris-johnson-roadmap-atypically-slow-steady,Opinion,Boris Johnson’s Covid roadmap must not repeat the prime minister’s past mistakes | Andrew Rawnsley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/boris-johnson-roadmap-atypically-slow-steady,"It is a sign of our times that the only live theatre currently available is that staged by politicians. Boris Johnson will tomorrow unveil his “roadmap” for easing out of coronavirus restrictions, a moment that is being fanfared as a big, dramatic event. The journey planner will be shown to the cabinet on Monday morning and then presented to the Commons before a prime ministerial news conference in the evening. I can’t tell you exactly what will be in the document, because it is still being wrangled over within government as I write. At this juncture of the crisis, as at every similar one, cabinet ministers are making last-minute special pleas to have the plan amended to advance one client group or another up the list of priority areas for coming out of restrictions. My conversations suggest that the plan is likely to be heavily hedged and highly tentative. The title “roadmap” will invest it with more solidity than it will truly possess. Anyone yearning to know when precisely they will be permitted to go to the pub, visit the cinema or holiday abroad will be disappointed. Let us hope so, anyway. It will be time to be alarmed if the prime minister breezily flourishes a roadmap that is dangerously confident about when all of the lockdown will be lifted. He has taken that hairy highway before by racing to ease restrictions only to put the country in a ditch of surging infections, intense pressure on the health service, escalating fatality rates and increased damage to the economy. The nadir was in early January when schools were reopened, only for ministers to be impelled to tell them to shut again on the very same day. The successful start to the vaccination programme is encouraging expectations that some kind of end to the crisis is at last in prospect. That is a boost to national morale. It is also a political fillip, deserved or not, for the prime minister. At the same time, it presents a challenge in managing both public opinion and his own party. He needs to keep the hopes aroused by the vaccination programme contained within the boundaries of prudence. It also presents those trying to advise the prime minister with a challenge of their own. That is how to stop him surrendering to the anti-lockdown libertarians on the Tory benches and succumbing to his own innate yearning to proclaim the crisis over by promising another perilously rapid reopening. For the greater part of the coronavirus crisis, expectations management is one of the things at which Mr Johnson has been especially dreadful. He repeatedly made baseless promises that excited false hopes about how quickly the virus could be squashed. He became addicted to offering bogus prognostications about when the crisis would end. Last March, he was telling us “I’m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing” and added the claim “we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks”. It was going to be beaten by the summer, then by the autumn, and then in time to “save Christmas”. The raising and then crushing of expectations that the nation could have a near-normal Christmas was especially dismal. Since that debacle, the prime minister has given some impression of a man who is trying to learn from his mistakes. “What’s really interesting is that Boris has gone all cautious – which is really welcome,” says one former Tory cabinet minister of the careful tendency. There’s also a bit of evidence that Mr Johnson is learning that results, not rhetoric, are what matter when battling a virus which is beatable by science, but not by his bluster. Last week the government met its target for delivering the first 15m vaccinations and did so a day ahead of the original schedule. Some allies of the prime minister report that he has slowly grasped that it is better to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way round. Yet it is also clear to anyone who has observed his recent public performances that he finds it a constant struggle to sustain the new, more disciplined public persona that has been on display since he was forced to put the country back into lockdown after the turn of the year. He lapsed back into crass comedy when he cracked a joke about OJ Simpson during a recent visit to a vaccination centre. His syntax can get tortured when he tries to suppress his instinctive boosterism. After retailing so much false hope in the past, his latest formula is that exit from this lockdown must be “cautious but irreversible”. We can see why. After the first lockdown, he declared that a second would be “a disaster”. Only to be compelled to impose a tier system that became a second lockdown in all but name, which was followed by the third lockdown that the country currently endures. Cabinet members report that the prime minister is absolutely desperate to avoid a fourth.
“The public were pretty understanding of the first and second lockdowns, but less forgiving that we have had to go into a third,” says one senior Tory. “The obvious political calculation by Boris is that a fourth lockdown would be disastrous for him – possibly even terminal.” That has made him more receptive to the counsel to ease with great care that he is receiving from Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. The two men have had to endure some torrid periods during the crisis, notably last autumn when the unrepresentative, but noisy, libertarian faction of the Tory party and their allies in the rightwing press were beating up the senior advisers for correctly forecasting that the virus was getting out of control. The monikers “Dr Doom” and “Professor Gloom” were the least of a campaign as vicious as it was ignorant to try to discredit them. The advisers have since had the vindication, albeit a grim one measured in the wave of fatalities that they warned was coming, of being proved right. The let-it-rippers, liberate-us-nowists and other varieties of anti-lockdowners have had repeated experience of being on the wrong end of the argument, but that has not stopped them from shouting as loudly as ever. The self-named Covid Recovery Group of Tory backbenchers and their media megaphones are as clamorous as ever for the lockdown to be lifted to a timetable of arbitrary dates of their inexpert choosing.
They still exert a gravitational pull on a prime minister who would probably be one of them himself if he were a Tory backbencher, but there are some indications that their baleful influence on Number 10 is weakening. “The success of the vaccination programme has given Boris enough political space to face down the extreme libertarians,” remarks one senior Tory. The prime minister appears to be less resistant to taking scientific advice, even when it isn’t what he wants to hear, than he was a few months ago. He has lately adopted the mantra, one originally minted by the scientists, that decisions about easing will be determined by “data not dates”. During the preparation of the roadmap, Professor Whitty and Sir Patrick have impressed on the prime minister that any kind of easing will inevitably lead to some increase in the levels of infection. This recommends a gradualist approach of relaxing restrictions in a phased way which allows sufficient time after each step of easing to measure its impact on infection levels before deciding whether to take the next step. A person highly familiar with discussions inside government reports that “don’t go into things blind” has been the consistent advice of the senior scientists. The government is amassing a lot of quality data, but there are still some critical uncertainties. The precise efficacy of vaccines in reducing transmission is still to be determined. Another area of doubt is whether the impressive pace of the inoculation programme can be sustained. The biggest unknown is about mutations of the virus. There are now believed to be around 4,000 variants in circulation around the world. One close observer of the government’s decision-making remarks: “We have to be very careful until we know that we are not going to encounter a variant which we can’t control with the vaccines currently available.” When he unfolds his roadmap, it will be natural for many to hope that the prime minister is going to tell them when the crisis will be over. He can’t do that. If he is honest with the public, he will stress that there is no quick, easy or assured escape back to normality. He will eschew the calamitous over-optimism that has been his trademark for much of this epidemic. The country will be best served if Boris Johnson acts out of character. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",2021-02-21 08:45:00+00:00,118894,67
118944,commentisfree/2021/feb/21/observer-view-on-boris-johnson-roadmap-announcement,Opinion,The Observer view on Boris Johnson’s Covid roadmap announcement | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/observer-view-on-boris-johnson-roadmap-announcement,"‘Let’s use data, not dates” – so said the government’s deputy chief medical adviser, Angela McLean, on Thursday to MPs as she was questioned over the right framework for the roadmap out of lockdown. Tomorrow is the long-awaited day when the prime minister sets out his plan, and it’s plain that he and his medical advisers are at odds. Both have seen very encouraging data – the number of reported cases is falling sharply, as are hospitalisations and deaths. Imperial College’s React 1 study last week showed that infections in England have dropped by two-thirds in less than a month. The R rate is now estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, well below the 1.0 above which the virus spreads exponentially. Public Health England has early data suggesting the vaccination success is beginning to have an impact on Covid’s transmission. What is provoking debate is how much this encouraging data can inform pre-announced dates for easing over the next few months. The answer, beyond 8 March, is not at all – with McLean’s boss, Chris Whitty, reportedly unhappy that Johnson is insistent that dates for action should frame decision-making, even if caveated by how the data evolves. Instead, data should be the alpha and omega of the whole process. There is one area of agreement. Extrapolation of trends to 8 March means that even cautious scientists recognise that the risks of opening primary schools, allowing hand-holding in care homes, reopening socially distanced outside sports such as golf and tennis, and meeting one person outdoors, outside one’s bubble, are very low. The boosterish prime minister will be allowed to announce some, if not all these measures as good news. The issue is what lies beyond. In thrall to a vocal libertarian right, Johnson then wants to announce, at two- or three-week intervals, trigger dates for decisions under the banner of a “cautious but irreversible relaxation”, so that by early summer the country – save for continued social distancing and mask-wearing – will be back to semi-normal. Under this timetable, non-essential shops would open at the end of March; outside hospitality over Easter; universities and all schools after Easter; and further easing to allow pubs and restaurants to open by early May. The Tory right will be jubilant, but the country is the constituency, not one wing of his party. The approach of easing by trigger dates is wrong.
The disagreement is not over whether this must be the last lockdown: everyone wants that. The social, educational, economic and mental health costs are known to us all. Everyone would like every act of easing – from opening schools to socialising more freely indoors – to be irreversible too, but this is where bitter disagreement arises. Johnson cannot promise this is to be the last lockdown under the excuse that pre-announced dates are only indicative and will not trigger easing if the data suggests otherwise. The medical officers know Johnson is incapable of resisting pressure from the right of his party and pre-announcing dates invites a repeat of the mistakes that have led to Britain having among the highest Covid death rates in the world. Instead, the prime minister should say that data will drive lockdown easing, which cannot be irreversible if the trends suddenly become adverse. He will be guided at all times by advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre on appropriate alert levels, and stick to one overriding target, rather than switching targets as they suit political exigencies. The Blair Foundation suggests only one target makes sense: to keep the R rate below 1.0 and reported cases stable or falling. The correct approach is to aim for this target, with the government agile enough to tighten pre-emptively, according to the data, or relax earlier if improvements are enduring.
Despite the vaccination success, too much is still unknown. It may be true that by the end of April nearly every 50-year-old will be vaccinated, and healthy under-50s made up just 0.94% of deaths in 2020. But we still do not know how much and for how long vaccines afford protection, how fast the vaccination programme will go, how quickly mutations are spreading and whether they are resistant to vaccines, and even to what extent the vaccinated can spread the disease. Johnsonian boosterism in this context is mad. The good news, beyond the vaccination programme, is that the test-and-trace system is beginning to function well. People are now contacted on average within 78 hours of being near a Covid carrier, down from 120 hours in the autumn. Coming out of lockdown, local government and the NHS now have access to data, testing results, and a functioning test-and-trace system that would allow the tiering system to work in a way it did not in the autumn – especially if there were proper financial compensation for those who have to self-isolate. It is long overdue for the Treasury to model the costs of not incentivising compliance and spread of the virus, rather than worrying over the costs of furloughing. The sooner the virus is under control, the better the economic prospects. It is a critical moment. Lives and sustained economic recovery, capitalising on the vaccination success, depend on the prime minister putting data before dates, sticking to the clearest of targets and relaxing step by secure step as alert levels indicate. His scientists and medical officers know these truths. It is time they backed them with resignations if they fear they are being ignored. Too much hurt, privation and death is at stake for any other action.",2021-02-21 06:00:53+00:00,118945,2
118983,commentisfree/2021/feb/21/we-need-to-stop-scapegoating-individuals-during-covid-outbreaks-the-virus-is-the-villain,Opinion,We need to stop scapegoating individuals during Covid outbreaks. The virus is the villain | Van Badham,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/we-need-to-stop-scapegoating-individuals-during-covid-outbreaks-the-virus-is-the-villain,"In the bible, a scapegoat is one of a pair of animals employed within a ceremonial ritual to represent sin, admission and purification. One goat is slain as an offering to God. The other goat is “presented alive before the Lord”, and symbolically made to “wear” all the sins of the community, before being released into the wilderness so as to take those sins elsewhere. In Australia, in a time of pandemic, a scapegoat is some poor bastard who works in a pizza shop, forcibly recruited within a pair of media and political rituals to be demonised and ostracised for having a second job in a quarantine hotel, and personally blamed for spreading the virus. You know, that virus that is insanely contagious, rapidly mutating, has infected 110,000,000 worldwide, killed nearly 2.5 million of them, and has even been found in the unpopulated ice content of Antarctica. You might have thought that transmission and spread of the virus may have been facilitated by an intersection of everything from its virulence and suddenness, to short-falls in public health governance (America), poor public policy leadership (hello Boris Johnson!), inadequate resourcing, the physical properties of urban design, trade routes, grifting culture war campaigns run by political opportunists, an as-yet-incomplete scientific understanding of it, and the inevitable fuckups made when actual, live human beings are tasked to do anything at all. We’ve been living with this thing for a year now. These facts are on record. But if you read certain newspapers – or, if you’re only on Facebook, filled with the kind of rumour-mongering that your ex’s step-brother might half-remember from a newspaper – you’d have a firm case to make that this year of misery and mass death was all due to the dude in the pizza shop, definitely him. The Australian reported this week that “two men who became hate figures” in South Australia are trying to rebuild their lives after becoming the target of political blame for spreading the coronavirus they caught while working in a quarantine hotel. A 20-officer police taskforce was deployed to “go over” Adelaide’s Woodville Pizza Bar, watching 400 hours of CCTV footage and seizing staff members’ mobile phones. Meanwhile, denizens of social media sharpened their goat-gutting knives and speculated the pizza shop simply must have links to organised crime, drug dealing, illegal work practices, aliens from space, Bigfoot, Bill Gates and a magical poop-shovel that when deployed on an Adelaide pavement created temporal portals for the entry of nefarious airborne whales. I may have made several of these accusations up, but given the present state of Facebook, satire of this sort, alas, does not stay satire for too long. The police, of course, found nothing, two men endured public humiliation while suffering terrifying infection from a lethal virus, the pizza shop owners were “decent and law abiding” and the investigation was closed in December. The pizza shop experience was a repeat of the humiliation that ensued back in July when two teenage girls did something careless, naughty, indulgent and self-endangering by thinking rules did not apply to them, which has apparently never happened in this history of teenagers anywhere, and certainly not in Queensland. They were not only photographed, named, shamed and doxxed on the front page of newspapers, but vivisected on social media. All the while, they were not only facing police charges and serious fines but they, also, had coronavirus. Before that, there was a villain in Hobart, who disgracefully brought his infected self to work, at a time when no one knew much about the virus and, also, he had to work. There have been others – conspicuously, it’s people of colour, the working and the poor who have faced the naming and vitriol that spared whiter, richer and perhaps more Aspen-visiting vectors of infection. But there should be none. Careless individual acts are part of our risk matrix but our systems have overwhelmed them, again and again. Australia has had some physical advantages that limited the spread of the virus, our public systems were for the most part robust, state governments were prepared to weather the consequences of correct but difficult decisions, the vast majority of the population diligently followed public health guidelines, and we did not face the ravages in other countries because we also had a lot of luck. Don’t believe in luck? Say the words “Ruby Princess” into a mirror three times at midnight, I dare ya. “Scapegoat theory” holds that people seek to focus resentment on others when they themselves feel victimised and powerless, and seek a target onto which feelings of hostility can be safely displaced. Strangers mentioned in social media posts for their self-harming mistakes or compromises are handy substitutes for an invisible killer virus whose behaviour won’t be shamed or changed even if it cops a by-name bollocking in the Herald-Sun. But it’s not healthy. Not when such targeting can feed into tribal in-group/out-group discourses that morph into classism, racism or xenophobia all too quickly, especially on the internet. The fixation on individual behaviours ignores and makes silent the crucial lesson that this miserable year has to teach the world – yes, even the Americans. It’s the strength of collective systems that ultimately help us or harm us. People can be goats, that’s true. Twelve months in, we should know by now; the virus itself remains the villain here.",2021-02-20 19:00:41+00:00,118984,2
119061,commentisfree/2021/feb/20/why-cases-covid-workplace-not-being-reported-uk,Opinion,Why are cases of Covid in the workplace not being reported in the UK? | Alice Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/20/why-cases-covid-workplace-not-being-reported-uk,"Shortly before the pandemic began I started working as an adviser to shareholders – mostly local authority and trade union pension funds – on labour rights concerns in the companies in which they invest. Circumstances changed very quickly, but this has led me to speak, from my living room, on a weekly basis to people in frontline services about their working situations. I’ve talked to their union representatives and employers as part of formal meetings on behalf of the company shareholders. I have heard about countless instances of dangerous practices and rash decisions by companies. In the scramble to balance workforce safety with protecting their bottom line, mistakes have been made – often repeatedly and in some cases systemically. Someone working in a food plant recalled colleagues being asked to wear cake boxes as masks. A union rep took a call from a woman in tears who was expected to clean care home rooms of deceased Covid patients with just a cloth and disinfectant spray. People across the UK took public transport to work while unwell because they couldn’t afford not to. Accounts like these help us understand why the UK has lost so many lives to Covid – but stories will only get us so far. If we really want to understand the role of employment practices in spreading the virus, we need reliable data on how many workforce Covid cases and fatalities have occurred – and in which workplaces. If you thought there was a central database collecting this, unfortunately you’d be wrong. Guidance on what employers should do to report outbreaks is riddled with inconsistencies. Some councils suggest that all workplace Covid cases should prompt contact with the health protection team. But advice from Public Health England – broken down by sector – suggests that certain employers (including industrial firms such as food processors where we’ve seen serious outbreaks) should only contact local health teams if things get so bad that they need to close a plant, someone is admitted to hospital or, tellingly, if they get “significant interest from local media”. That leaves a lot of scope for employers to self-manage outbreaks. Things get even patchier when we look at what data is being collected by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) – the body with authority to prosecute companies found to be putting workforces in danger. Under regulations for the reporting of injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences at work (Riddor), the HSE only requires employers to report Covid cases if they have “reasonable evidence to suggest that it was caused by occupational exposure”. In other words, can you prove the employee caught the virus at work? If not, don’t report. Unsurprisingly, then, there is a massive reporting gap unfolding. At Pensions and Investments Research Consultancy (PIRC), we’ve been tracking how Riddor is being used by companies in different sectors. Only 365 cases have been recorded by the HSE in food processing (despite us finding at least 2,666 cases reported in local media), and only two fatalities – a dubious figure given that our research of media reports alone have covered 11 deaths and we know of several others. In warehousing, only 397 cases have been reported, and three fatalities. But there have been monthly outbreaks in the picking and packing facilities that serve online retailers and supermarkets. And we know there have been more deaths – the Office for National Statistics dataset of Covid-related deaths by occupation, compiled from the death register, has recorded 120 fatalities among warehouse workers (classed as “elementary storage occupations”). So where are the corresponding reports from employers? One of the starkest discrepancies is that only 20 cases in “security and investigation activities” have been disclosed, and no fatalities. But male security guards have one of the highest Covid death rates across all occupational groups. Some of this discrepancy will be down to confusion about which sector cases should be logged under, and which employer should log them – especially in services like security where there are usually multiple layers of subcontracting. But the main reason for the underreporting by companies is the grey area about whether they even have to. The HSE puts a serious burden of proof on the doorstep of employers – to determine where a Covid case was contracted. And let’s be honest, they are not impartial agents. Not only are employers ill-equipped to determine how a deadly virus spreads, they have a clear interest in designating cases as “community transmissions” – to avoid fines down the line, not to mention bad publicity. Piled on top of this there is ambiguity about where to draw the line between a workplace and the wider community. If you work in a warehouse with a thousand other people on the outskirts of a small town, you will share your commute, local amenities and even maybe accommodation with colleagues. If you pick up Covid on the crowded company bus does the employer have a duty to report it? Under current guidance, no.
A spokesperson from a food plant told me that even when there had been 300 positive cases (a fifth of staff on site), they felt confident these were “community transmissions”. Underreporting has become self-reinforcing. Companies that want to be transparent are wary of doing so in case they look like outliers – they are understandably scared to stick their neck out. As one investor relations manager of a big outsourcing company put it when I asked why they weren’t disclosing their double-figure fatalities: “It’s just not a very nice statistic.” So what can we do? At PIRC we feel strongly that government should show leadership on a new approach to reporting on the workplace transmission of Covid which prioritises transparency and consistency. For now let’s not sweat about where cases were picked up – our authorities are too underfunded to adjudicate this in real time. Let’s instead require companies to disclose all cases and fatalities. This information should be in the public realm so comparisons can be drawn between company statistics and sectoral and national averages – and when we eventually hold a public inquiry into why things have gone so horribly wrong in the UK, the chapter on corporate accountability can be written.

119147,commentisfree/2021/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-sharing-vaccines-protecting-others-protects-us,Opinion,The Guardian view on sharing vaccines: protecting others protects us | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-sharing-vaccines-protecting-others-protects-us,"Can naked self-interest achieve what a sense of justice has signally failed to do? Perhaps. Friday’s G7 meeting offers some hope that, at last, wealthy countries are waking up to the need to share vaccines more equitably with the rest of the world. More than 193m doses have been given globally, including more than 16m in the UK – yet 130 countries have yet to receive a single dose. Boris Johnson, the meeting’s host, urged countries to help cut the time it takes to produce vaccines, and promised to donate surplus doses to poorer countries – but only once the UK’s own citizens are all vaccinated. (Polling suggests the public is more than three times as likely to support sharing surplus doses as it is to back keeping them “just in case”). Meanwhile, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has urged Europe and the US to send up to 5% of their vaccines to poorer countries now – though the US was quick to demur. What has changed? Mr Macron warned of an unprecedented acceleration of global inequality. But he was candid enough to also cite the emerging “war of influence”. G7 nations are worried that others are gaining an advantage by providing the doses they have failed to share. China and Russia have supplied more than 800m doses between them to 41 countries. These countries certainly have their own diplomatic agendas and economic interests to pursue; small donations are bolstered by much larger commercial deals. But they are, at least, supplying what is desperately needed. India too is sending millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine – produced at the Serum Institute of India – to Bangladesh and other south Asian countries, with one eye on China’s regional influence. It is hard to see how countries that have yet to hand over any doses can try to claim the moral high ground in these circumstances, and repugnant to watch geopolitics push them towards action when humanitarian concerns failed to do so. By international standards, the UK has been a generous donor to the Covax pooled purchase scheme, which is due to begin delivery of vaccines from the end of this month. But charities say G7 countries have ordered 1.5bn vaccines more than they need to cover their whole populations, hindering the ability of Covax to buy sufficient supplies. Richer countries have effectively boasted of handing out cash for poorer countries to buy doses – while sweeping all the available goods into their own shopping baskets. The second spur towards action is the emergence of variants that appear much more transmissible, including those originating in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, and which existing vaccines may not be so effective against. The head of the UK’s genetic surveillance programme has suggested the one first found in Kent – which may carry a higher risk of death – could become the world’s dominant strain. Worryingly, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may be less protective against the South African variant. The temptation for wealthier countries is to hoard the different vaccines they have ordered, to ensure that they have the best options to protect their citizens as new variants emerge. This would be a grave mistake. The more transmission occurs, the more variants are likely to emerge – and the more likely it becomes that vaccine-resistant variants will be among them. These will not be confined within national borders, even given current travel restrictions; the South African variant has reached at least 20 countries. The real lesson is that we should be sharing vaccines as a matter of priority – not only for other countries’ sakes, but for our own.",2021-02-19 18:30:10+00:00,119148,2
119177,commentisfree/2021/feb/19/safely-end-uk-covid-lockdown-pandemic,Opinion,Here are the four steps needed to safely end the UK's Covid lockdown | Jeanelle de Gruchy,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/19/safely-end-uk-covid-lockdown-pandemic,"Directors of public health across the UK have been thinking deeply about how our communities can live with Covid-19 in the months ahead. Although people have shown remarkable commitment to looking out for one another during this past year, we can’t afford to endure an endless cycle of lockdowns forever. The social, physical, mental and economic costs are simply too high. But neither can we accept high levels of Covid-19. Increased transmission results in a greater risk of new variants emerging and leads to severe illness and death. So as the government prepares to issue its forthcoming “roadmap” for easing restrictions, what should this look like? There are four principles that should guide the government’s approach to lifting the lockdown. Our first collective aim should be reducing transmission to as low a level as possible – and keeping it low. To do this, we’ll need to continue with interventions such as social distancing and remote working. There will be no quick transition back to normal. It’s likely that some restrictions will still be needed in months to come, but these should be dynamic and flexible, responding to different risks as they arise. Restrictions should only be lifted in a phased, cautious way and only when levels of transmission are judged low enough to do so. People have already grown used to washing their hands regularly, wearing face coverings and maintaining social distance from others. As lockdown restrictions are eased, keeping these behaviours in place will help protect ourselves and others against Covid-19. Secondly, it will be crucial that we continue to monitor transmission and quickly identify any new variants. Public Health England deserves enormous credit for its work in providing and developing an early warning system capable of swiftly identifying variants and increases in transmission rates. Likewise, the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium has played a vital role in sequencing and identifying new variants of the virus. As we’ve learned over the past year, hesitation leads to hospitalisation and deaths. When restrictions are eased, we will have to be prepared to act fast, both locally and nationally, to get ahead of the virus. The third important aspect of this roadmap should be a highly effective test, trace, isolate and support system. As cases fall and people begin to mix again, keeping the virus under control will depend upon the effectiveness of this system. Financial and practical support must be available to people who are asked to isolate, and the NHS test and trace system should be localised, with resources passed down from Whitehall to regional and local health authorities.
Finally, although the vaccination programme has been a success story, it’s vital that we support as many people as possible to receive the jab. Councils and communities must work together to ensure those who are least likely to take up the offer of a vaccination are engaged and supported, whether through targeted, culturally aware communication campaigns or enlisting community representatives to encourage uptake. Local community leaders, businesses, faith groups, libraries, schools, sports clubs and local media will all be central to these efforts. Of course, the success of all of these measures will rely on a contract with the public. We don’t just need a plan, but a campaign to build trust. There are no magic bullets to solve this pandemic, and our focus must be on designing and funding the tools we have so they work to maximum effect. A full recovery from Covid-19 won’t be possible unless we address the underlying structural inequalities that help the infection to persist. We owe it to the diverse and disadvantaged communities who have paid the highest price for the virus to plot a recovery that addresses our nation’s health inequalities. This will mean improving and investing in the social determinants of health, such as housing, air quality, education, income and food. All of these underlying factors overwhelmingly shape how long each of us lives in good health. It seems likely that we’ll be living with Covid-19 for some time to come. But with these measures in place, we should be optimistic that we can do so safely, while moving towards brighter days.

119331,commentisfree/2021/mar/31/where-have-i-found-peace-in-the-pandemic-taking-part-in-a-covid-vaccine-trial,Opinion,Where have I found peace in the pandemic? Taking part in a Covid vaccine trial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/31/where-have-i-found-peace-in-the-pandemic-taking-part-in-a-covid-vaccine-trial,"I’ve thoroughly enjoyed being a vaccine triallist. As I’ve mentioned before, I’m on the Novavax trial. When I look back on this past year, I’ll remember my visits to the hospital with fondness. I’ve found them to be pleasant little diversions from the rhythm of my locked-down life. I just bowl in and everyone seems vaguely glad I’ve made the effort. I’m pleased to see them, too, although I know them only by their eyes, hair arrangements and voices. It’s an odd thing that I’ll probably never get to see their faces; once it’s over, I’ll be able to walk past them in the street, or at a pub, a gig or a football match, or wherever unmasked top trial types hang out, and not know them from Adam or Eve. And vice versa, I suppose. Yesterday, after removing my mask for a vigorous poking about the throat and nostrils by a nice nurse with a long name from Murcia, I forgot to put it back on. This earned me a stern ticking off from one of the doctors, which I took on my exposed chin. No, they don’t do faces around there. And there was plainly no great appetite to see mine. Oddly, given that the trial is the closest I’ve come to the eye of the Covid storm, what I’ve found most enjoyable about being there is the sense of switching off from the whole business; actually, switching off from everything. I leave any doubts, distrust or concerns outside the door to dissipate in the air of south-west London. Having committed to taking part in the trial, I took the view that there was no point worrying about it. I’ve had a good bash at reading the paperwork and understand most of it, if only in flashes. But paperwork isn’t my strong point and I’ve got enough to worry about in my life outside the strange little haven of that ward. It’s like I hand my 54-year-old body over to them and tell them to do what they will with it. I don’t mind; I trust them. And, importantly, in the unlikely event of anything going wrong, it won’t be my fault. This is critical; nearly everything else, big or small, that goes wrong around me in my life I have to take at least a little bit of blame for. Not here. It’s so liberating. I don’t suppose this is what psychologists are getting at when they encourage you to “let go”, but it feels like it to me. I suppose I must be a model triallist, because I just sit there, a study in mildness, shrugging in acquiescence at their every command or request. May I feel your glands? Of course. Take some blood? Knock yourself out. Prod you? Poke you? Stick this needle in you? Yes, yes, yes and yes to more besides. Don’t even ask; be my guest. I’m in full, heavenly, submission mode here; please don’t disturb my reverie. For my remaining visits, I’m going to hang a sign around my neck reading: QUIET PLEASE. THE ANSWER IS YES! My favourite bit is when someone has trouble drawing blood from my arm. After several apologies – don’t be silly, no problem, I protest – someone says: “Better get Serge.” I think that’s his name; he’s a great big French bloke and obviously the go-to man in difficult vein-finding situations. I don’t know whether he has an extra-long needle or something, but the Gallic extractor man has the claret flowing out the crook of my arm in no time at all. The only issue with my laissez-faire approach is that, because I don’t pay enough attention to what I’m told, I’ve only ever had a sketchy idea of what is going on. It turns out that I originally had either the vaccine or the placebo. Now, if I had the vaccine before, they have given me the placebo; if I had the placebo before, now I get the vaccine. So, in the end, I’ve been vaccinated, which is nice. But I wasn’t really that bothered whether I was or not: I’ve just been too pleased to be there. It’s a funny place to have found peace, to be sure, but a bit of peace it has been. Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist",2021-03-31 15:00:30+00:00,119332,2
119586,commentisfree/2021/mar/30/uae-covid-vaccine-global-leader-china,Opinion,"The UAE Covid vaccine could become a global leader, but we must see full data | Sophie Zinser",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/30/uae-covid-vaccine-global-leader-china,"China’s leading vaccine just got rebranded. On Sunday 28 March, its major pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm, announced a new joint venture with G42, a UAE-based tech company: the vaccine is called Hayat-Vax, hayat meaning “life” in Arabic. The partnership shows immense promise as a new source of vaccines across the developing world. But there’s a catch: a lack of scientific transparency in its phase III clinical trial data. A successful phase III trial is the golden seal confirming a jab’s efficacy once and for all. It allows scientists to observe possible side effects and make comparisons with placebo cases, while mirroring real-life conditions. From a scientific perspective, it provides critical evidence for developing future vaccines. But Hayat-Vax’s phase III data hasn’t been released. Sinopharm has already released peer-reviewed phase I and II data in the Lancet. It proves the BBIBP-CorV vaccine – which has been administered to tens of millions of people – is indeed safe for use, but does not validate its efficacy rate. Last December, China announced that the Sinopharm vaccine is 79.34% effective based on what it dubbed “interim trial data” without releasing phase III results. This contradicted the UAE’s estimate of 86% for the same jab, leading to confusion over the vaccine’s actual efficacy. In Sunday’s announcement, G42 did not mention anything regarding Hayat-Vax’s phase III clinical trial data. Still, renaming the jab in Arabic may be a smart move in the world of vaccine diplomacy: it distances the Sinopharm vaccine from its Chinese roots and epitomises China’s narrative of “neutral engagement” in the Middle East and North Africa. It may well help increase the jab’s international uptake, which so far has been mixed. Egypt, for example, kicked off its vaccine rollout in January using Sinopharm but, despite acquiring 350,000 doses, doctors, nurses and the elderly hesitated to take the jabs, citing concerns about its credibility. On the other hand, in developing nations where China’s role is less commercially significant – such as Jordan – scepticism regarding Pfizer’s efficacy as a “new type of vaccine” (it uses mRNA technology) and the AstraZeneca jab, despite data confirming their safety, have cast Sinopharm in a better light. Without peer-reviewed, phase III data citing its efficacy, Hayat-Vax’s domestic trustworthiness will in large part be determined by the political climate rather than the scientific community. Commercial demand for the vaccine is definitely there, and likely on the rise. The global Covax initiative hopes to vaccinate only 20% of developing countries’ most vulnerable populations, leaving governments to seek remaining doses from private deals. Nations such as Honduras and Argentina are already striking private deals for vaccines such as Russia’s Sputnik V and the German-US Pfizer. Starting next month, the venture aims to produce 2m doses per month. Annually, it hopes to eventually meet targets of 200m. The UAE has the geopolitical bandwidth to rebrand the Sinopharm vaccine partly because it is the world’s second most vaccinated country. Its push to manufacture vaccines is also part of larger ambitions to diversify local industry away from hydrocarbons. While the UAE is also trialling Russia’s Sputnik V, it was Sinopharm and G42’s partnership that made history last July when the two launched the world’s first phase III clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine in Abu Dhabi.
On the surface, G42 might also seem an unlikely contender for dominating the developing world’s vaccine industry. The company markets itself as a “leading artificial intelligence and cloud computing company”, with partnerships spanning the Afghan aviation authority and Israeli agritech. Behind G42’s vision is its chair, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a prominent member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family. Sheikh Tahnoon is known for his skills as a behind-the-scenes operator, his shrewd business sense and a growing interest in digitising the UAE’s commercial endeavours. The UAE’s $232bn sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, invested an undisclosed sum in G42 last year. Covered by G42’s financial safety net, Hayat-Vax may be too rich to fail, with or without trial data. Global power competition and financial flows aside, until either G42 or Sinopharm publish cold hard facts, Hayat-Vax’s scientific credibility remains unconfirmed. Using interim trial data as a basis for proceeding with global manufacturing sets an unhelpful precedent for future scientific innovations. Publishing Hayat-Vax’s data in an internationally credible scientific journal may not seem like an urgent priority right now, but G42 executives should see this gap as a market opportunity. If Hayat-Vax definitively proves it is 79% effective, the UAE would become a leading player in nearly every country’s vaccine market overnight. Both the UAE and China already have a soft-power advantage over western governments since they see developing countries as potential customers, rather than passive recipients of aid. A consumer-driven attitude, combined with a proven, effective, low-cost vaccine, may offer life for populations around the world. All it would take is some form of credible data. As China’s former chief food and drug regulator, Bi Jingquan, put it when he urged Chinese companies to share the phase III results: “With more data, the more transparency, the better.” Sophie Zinser is a Schwarzman Academy fellow in the Asia Pacific and Middle East-North Africa Programme at Chatham House",2021-03-30 11:00:41+00:00,119587,2
119818,commentisfree/2021/mar/29/covid-britain-doctor-intensive-care-london-hospital,Opinion,"When Covid hit Britain, I was a new doctor. Here's why I didn't give up | Shaan Sahota",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/29/covid-britain-doctor-intensive-care-london-hospital,"I was eight months into my career as a doctor when the first wave of Covid-19 hit London and the hospital where I work. Before this time, as a medic, I felt powerful – not as an individual, but as one part of a formidable system. There were times when I observed my team and saw how together we seemed to acquire a superhuman mightiness. We could see your past (medical history), and use algorithms to predict the future. We had X-ray vision (and MRI, and PET, and CT). Together we could perform near miraculous feats, from transplanting hearts to dissolving pain. When the pandemic hit, surgery was cancelled at the hospital where I work and I was redeployed to critical care. There I found myself drowning in the first swell of Covid cases. I saw up-close the death of patients who would have expected many years of good health ahead of them. Not that the statistically “timely” deaths were any less painful to watch, as gasping individuals tell you that they are afraid, and all the reasons they aren’t ready to die. Working in the ICU meant I saw no one with mild disease, no one who would go home after a few days of antibiotics and observation. I met only people whose Covid had left them intubated and ventilated. The most stable patients were transferred to other hospitals, leaving those with multi-organ failure, whom we could not oxygenate. As the pandemic raged on, I struggled to cope with the deaths that I was witnessing. All of a sudden, the practice of medicine didn’t seem so powerful. Stethoscopes became an infection hazard; we needed two pairs of gloves before we could feel for a pulse. Stripped of our tools, our workforce halved by sickness and fear, we staggered on. The work felt painful and futile. Why am I doing this, I thought, and on what terms do I find it rewarding? Do I, deep down, want to care only for patients who have a chance of getting well? It was an early stage in my career to face so much death and suffering, but I know that my more experienced colleagues have also struggled. I have now seen every grade of doctor cry. And it was through the casual guidance of my senior colleagues that I began to glimpse a path through it all. One night shift, I spoke to a consultant thyroid surgeon in a halogen-lit corridor. “You seem frazzled,” she said. “You should go home.” “I’m fine. I just want to go on a ward round outside ICU. I just want to speak to one patient who’s not dying.” “That doesn’t help anyone. Tell me, who of us isn’t going to die?” It was a simple question but it jolted my perspective. That same week, a senior orthopaedic surgeon, now redeployed to the “proning team” – turning patients on to their front to alleviate acute respiratory distress – quietly threw me another lifeline. As we exchanged scrubs for civilian clothes in the ICU locker room, she said, “I went through the same thing as you in my third year, when I was attached to a neurosurgery firm. There was so little we could do, for so many of our patients.” I saw what she was telling me: this isn’t exceptional – this is the fabric of medical practice. Another colleague casually reminded me at a handover what a privilege medicine grants us, to be the one stranger in the room during these painful, private moments of existential transition. They may appear obvious, but these lessons were a revelation Once more, I was able to find strength outside of myself. These are fragments of conversations that amount to minutes, but I was able to distil them into three principles. 1) To die is not bad luck, but an inevitable result of being born. This does not make the practice of medicine futile. 2) Our job is not just to save lives, but to care for people when they are sick, and do anything we can to promote more time in health. 3) We have chosen the realm of suffering and sickness; as much as we wish (for our patient’s sake) that everything will be well, we train for the times that things aren’t right. We meet people when they are at their lowest, feeling weak and sick. That is where we will make a difference. I feel acutely what a responsibility and privilege it is to care for people when they are unwell. The practice of medicine isn’t about negating death, but valuing life – and all we can ever hope to gain is a little more time. The application of so much training, effort, resource and expertise to something so small in absolute terms is remarkable when you think about it. I could not be prouder to be a part of it.

In the interim Boris “I Shook Hands With Everyone” Johnson had ignored emails about a Europe-wide PPE purchasing scheme; ignored experts’ recommendations to close pubs and restaurants; taken a holiday in Kent, back before it became clogged with lorry drivers’ faeces; got divorced from his second wife whom he had repeatedly cheated on, including, according to her testimony at least, with a handsomely publicly remunerated tech adviser; ignored further expert advice to close schools; endorsed the idea of herd immunity; announced his engagement to an environmentally concerned refurbishing enthusiast; skipped five successive Cobra meetings; shaken hands with everybody in a hospital; advised hand-washing; joined 82,000 rugby fans in Twickenham; ignored further lockdown calls in early March; made international sports fans mingle in Cheltenham and Liverpool; abandoned contact tracing; allowed people into the country unchecked from virus hotspots; told NHS staff to wear less of the PPE he declined to order earlier; hosted a shower for his latest baby two days before telling people to reduce social contact; herded 5,000 Stereophonics fans into the killing ground of Cardiff Arena; finally told people not to go to pubs and venues but didn’t say that pubs and venues should close, a period now known as Schrödinger’s British Hospitality Industry; and then sent coronavirus-ridden patients back to the petri dishes of their care homes. But last Tuesday, when Dominic Yateswinelodge from the Metro asked Shake Hands live on TV: “When the time comes to describe this period to future generations, how will we explain how Britain suffered the highest death toll in Europe and the deepest recession?”, Boris Herd Immunity Johnson replied: “About aaah about aah you know your sort of league table question I I I you know I think I mean I er respectfully er go back to the answer you would have heard from the podium many times which is that the er the er the the pandemic is er alas tragically is not over yet er across the world and we will continue to er protect everyone is er to the to the er to the best of to the best of our abilities. This this this is not over and I think the international comparisons are are are premature at this stage.”
Premature international comparisons have, however, been useful to the Brexit-Covid government in extolling the superiority of our own vaccine rollout. And our dubiously awarded and criminally useless £37bn track-and-trace system was famously and falsely designated “world-beating”. It appears international comparisons must only be applied where they favour our nation. Nonetheless, Shake Hands’s answer seized the punch-drunk public’s imagination. By seven that evening, his answer, now known as the “About Aaah About Aah You Know Your Sort of League Table Question I I I You Know I Think I Mean I Er Respectfully Er” speech, had already dislodged Earl Spencer’s Princess Diana Funeral Oration from the No 1 spot of an online League Table of the Greatest Speechifying of All Time. This was ironic, given that the clear thrust of the speech was to discredit the idea of league tables and of the notion that anything should be compared with anything else generally. But memes swiftly developed, including re-edited footage of Martin Luther King’s I Have a Dream address, appearing to show him declaring: “About aaah about aah you know your sort of league table question I I I you know I think I mean I er respectfully er.” But those who had already voted for “About Aaah About Aah You Know… ” were, like international comparisons, premature. Dominic from the Metro then asked Shake Hands: “People who own holiday homes overseas, such as your father for instance, will be exempted from the travel ban affecting everyone else. Would you advise people to buy a second home abroad if they want to have a holiday this year?” In two simple, sarcastic sentences, the humble Metro scribe had Zoomed Shake Hands to the floor. But he had reckoned without our leader’s mastery of deliberately incoherent speechifying. “And on your point really about global ah ah travel and ah and ah holidays ah,” Shake Hands speechified, “a lot of people do want to know about um er er what’s going to happen on the on the on the holiday front and um er I er I I I know there’s a a a great deal of er curiosity and interest… Er er ab ab we’ve heard already that there are er er other European countries where the disease is now rising so things certainly look difficult for the for the er time being er but we we’ll be we’ll be able to say more er we hope in a few days time. I certainly I certainly hope to be er saying some more by 5 April and and er er I think that’s the best you can hope for there.” The main thrust of the question had been totally ignored. The Zoom format saw poor Dominic’s window swiftly shut before he could point this out and cunning Shake Hands’s calculated ineloquence had successfully created the illusion that something, of some sort, had been said. Time had passed. And the speech now known as “Er Er Ab Ab We’ve Heard Already That There Are Er Er” swiftly replaced “About Aaah About Aah You Know Your Sort of League Table Question I I I You Know I Think I Mean I Er Respectfully Er” at the top of the speechifying league tables.

120046,commentisfree/2021/mar/28/the-observer-view-on-emerging-from-covid-lockdown,Opinion,The Observer view on emerging from Covid lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/28/the-observer-view-on-emerging-from-covid-lockdown,"It will be hard for many people to suppress feelings of relief tomorrow as they enjoy the first lockdown freedoms of a spring that will hopefully lead to summer months devoid of all Covid restrictions. The country has endured a grim winter and the urge to step out and share time with friends and relatives has become increasingly intense. Such urges should be tempered with the recollection that we have been here before. Lockdowns were lifted last summer yet the virus quickly returned. The fear that it could re-emerge in a third, deadly wave cannot therefore be ignored, although two key factors should give us confidence that we are now better placed to control Covid-19 than in 2020. The first reassurance is straightforward. We can thank the remarkable success of a vaccination campaign that has seen more than 32 million people in the UK receive jabs, a programme that puts the nation on target to offer vaccines to all adults by July. And with vaccines not only warding off death and hospitalisations but also inducing reductions in virus transmissions, we can expect daily case rates to remain relatively modest. At least, that is the forecast, one that scientists will be monitoring with considerable care over coming months. The second factor is less striking but still provides comfort – for it is clear that a sense of caution now pervades the government, which seems better prepared to accept scientific advice and which appears less likely to indulge in bluster and on an insistence on the early reopening of the country at all costs. This has not always been the case, as Wellcome Trust director Jeremy Farrar made clear yesterday. As Farrar said, terrible damage was inflicted on the country when ministers recklessly refused to impose a September circuit-breaker lockdown urged on them by advisers who had become alarmed by new cases of Covid-19 soaring across the country. The end result was a jump in admissions to hospital that eventually led to a seven-week period in January and February when Covid deaths reached their highest levels of the last 12 months. People need reminding of this very dark statistic. Boris Johnson’s government may have learned its lesson but it has done so only after tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths have occurred in the UK. The current lockdown that we are only now preparing to leave could have been lifted long ago had the government demonstrated caution, listened to its advisers and acted more swiftly. Let’s hope it now sees sense. Certainly, Johnson’s rhetoric is showing some restraint at present. How long it stays that way is another matter. The country needs to remain diligent over the next few months. As we make clear elsewhere, there are genuine fears for the health of employees returning to workplaces that have not been assessed for Covid risks – at a time when our vaccination programme is still incomplete and when dangerous variants are still circulating. An example is provided by staff at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea, who are preparing to strike over safety concerns after more than 600 workers tested positive for Covid-19 in recent months. Those who continue to work at home face other problems, with one group of call centre employees having been told that webcams could be installed to monitor their activity and work levels at home. It is clear that after all our lockdowns, the route back to normality is going to be a hard one, a journey littered with problems as we try to readjust to the lifestyles we abandoned a year ago.

120156,commentisfree/2021/mar/27/capitalism-covid-boris-johnson-uk-vaccine-state-funding,Opinion,"Capitalism won't save us from Covid, no matter what Boris Johnson might think | Mariana Mazzucato",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/27/capitalism-covid-boris-johnson-uk-vaccine-state-funding,"Boris Johnson has attributed the UK’s vaccine success to “capitalism” and “greed”. Though these were crude remarks, if the prime minister’s words are any indication of his vision for how the UK can recover from the pandemic, there are worrying implications for the country’s policies at home and abroad. This is not the first time that Johnson has taken the wrong economic lessons from the Covid crisis. A few months ago he said in the same spirit that for “those on the left, who think everything can be funded by uncle sugar the taxpayer … there comes a moment when the state must stand back and let the private sector get on with it”. Nor is Johnson the first person to have viewed the vaccines as a private sector coup. It’s worth remembering that the “AstraZeneca” vaccine was created by scientists at the University of Oxford and developed and distributed by the pharmaceutical giant. Yet the private sector has emerged as the victor in the public celebration of Covid vaccines. In truth, an unprecedented amount of public funding has been poured into vaccine research, development and manufacturing. The leading six vaccine candidates have received an estimated $12bn (£8.7bn) of taxpayer and public money, including $1.7bn for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab and $2.5bn for the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate. This level of investment represents a huge risk – but it’s not the only risk that the public sector has taken on. Governments have used “advanced market commitments” to guarantee that private companies that successfully produce a Covid-19 vaccine are amply rewarded with huge orders.
Public funds spent on research and development are often more entrepreneurial – in the sense that governments are investing in the early, riskiest stages of health innovation, before any market is viable. This is part of the reason why companies were able to develop a Covid vaccine in record time. As a new report from the UK’s Industrial Strategy Council makes clear, the fast turnaround of Covid-19 vaccines would have been unthinkable without state involvement. Effective, “mission-oriented” government coordination – from industrial policy to investment in life sciences, strategic public procurement and public-private partnerships – has been key to the success story of Covid-19 vaccines. But there’s a major caveat to this narrative. Despite the government’s awareness of the UK’s strength in the life sciences sector, and its intention to boost it through two new sector deals, Britain’s capacity to manufacture sufficient doses is far from a given. Britain’s long-term failure to support its domestic manufacturing base is reflected in recent quarrels between the EU and UK over the supply of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. Prior to the crisis, the UK had been disinterested in investing in an onshore industrial base to mass-produce vaccines and other life science products. If ministers had floated a plan to invest in British vaccine factories prior to the coronavirus pandemic, they would have likely met with a less than enthusiastic reception. This is the benefit of hindsight. Yet hindsight also shows why a forward-looking, long-term industrial strategy that invests in productivity and economic growth, and at the same time targets broader challenges such as the climate crisis and future pandemics, is vital. Rather than seeing now as the moment to set out such a plan, Johnson is calling time on a sensible industrial strategy. The demise of the Industrial Strategy Council, recently announced, does not bode well for the uptake of its valuable insights. While the government has committed to doubling the UK’s public R&D expenditure to £22bn a year by 2024-25, it is proposing cuts to the budget of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), with funding for international development projects halved. If this undermines the infrastructure that was pivotal to the UK’s vaccine success, as seems likely, then the government’s newly founded Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) could risk becoming an expensive distraction. In the US, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa) model, from which Aria takes inspiration, has been a great success precisely because it’s located within a vibrant and decentralised research infrastructure backed by public investment in science, which the Biden administration is planning on boosting. That these cuts to UK research are taking place during a global pandemic sends a worrying message about Johnson’s priorities. When he talked about greed, he identified what is wrong about the system – not what merits praise. Alone, a vaccine won’t be enough to stop the coronavirus in its tracks, and the UK won’t be safe from Covid-19 until the majority of the world’s population has been vaccinated. It’s extremely difficult to see how greed will help ensure the vaccine is made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge.
Addressing pharmaceutical companies’ monopoly over the science, know-how and technology, and sharing this with as many countries as possible, will be essential to scaling up and decentralising vaccine manufacturing across the world. The World Health Organization has established a voluntary Covid-19 technology access pool (C-Tap) to enable governments and companies to do just this. In addition, South Africa and India have tabled a proposal to the WHO, backed by more than 100 countries, to temporarily waive intellectual property rights for Covid-related technologies. A recent poll found that 74% of people in the UK are supportive of these positions. In response, the government has overlooked the C-Tap and blocked the temporary waiver on intellectual property. When greed is a government’s guiding philosophy, “vaccine apartheid” is all but guaranteed. Already, 56% of more than 455m doses of vaccine have gone to people in high-income countries and just 0.1% have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries. Covax, which aims to vaccinate up to 27% of the population in 92 of the poorest countries, is unlikely to be enough on its own. Having done well with its own vaccine programme, the UK should now be on a strong footing to help deliver a People’s Vaccine for the world. The UK government’s pledge to donate surplus vaccines is a start, but this will be far from sufficient. What is needed is strong leadership and hope. Yet instead the prime minister appears to hold the anachronistic and counterproductive view that capitalism and greed are what will vaccinate the world and help rebuild it after the pandemic.

Certainly not the Tories | Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/26/who-should-be-applauded-for-the-vaccine-programme-certainly-not-the-tories,"My friend C was getting her vaccine round the corner from my house and wanted me to go with her. I thought this was for my sparkling company but actually it was because she was scared. She’s the most incredible baby. She got us lost – surely, on some level, deliberately – but there was no prospect of her missing her appointment since everybody, from the stewards to the form-hander-outers to the nurses, is just hell-bent on making this work. I haven’t seen such a symphony of joyful intent since I used to work the beer tents at festivals. “You’re surely not old enough for a jab?” the first steward said to her. “Right?” I nodded in agreement. “You should give it to me instead, I look way older than her.” This is a source of pain for everyone who knows C. When I told the kids I was going to Amsterdam for her 50th, my son said: “WHAT? She’s older than you?” and my daughter said: “She looks about 20.” Then I railed for hours about how biologically impossible it would be for a person with a 20-year-old daughter to also be 20, while driving like the angriest woman alive, so they’re unlikely to make that mistake twice. It turned out that the steward was also a friend of C’s, which made sense, since it’s quite a personal remark to make to a stranger. By now, I’d internally raised the prospect of scoring myself a vaccination that I didn’t, by age, yet merit; you hear this story a lot, that if a person were to loiter around a vaccination centre, they might get lucky, especially at the end of the day. I didn’t even want to be vaccinated. I’ve only just had Covid and I feel like it would be a waste of my precious antibodies. I’m not at all worried about vaccination passports to go to the pub – I don’t think anyone in government has the competence for such an undertaking, and I also think there would be riots. I might even enjoy rioting more than being in the pub. But still, I’d raised a moral dilemma and I couldn’t let it lie. What if they did offer me one? How would I feel about queue jumping? What was the balance of pro-social imperative, between depriving someone else, and making myself less of a danger to the outside world? By now we’d got through the forms, and an impossibly cheerful woman was telling us that I was allowed to go in with C, if she liked. They definitely weren’t doing me. Being highly fashionable – well, you would be, wouldn’t you, if you looked 20? – C was wearing a top that rendered her arms totally inaccessible from every angle. “Can’t you just put the needle in lower down?” she asked, and the nurse explained that no, he needed the shoulder bone as a reference point, and I thought, it’s interesting, isn’t it, that you always think you know how medical procedures work from the telly, but you’re always missing some vital piece of information. “Just take your top off and drape it over yourself for modesty, like President Macron,” I suggested, helpfully and not at all vindictively. “Ooh that sounds interesting, how did he do that?” said the nurse, and I hurried to find him a picture on my phone, except I couldn’t because it wasn’t Macron, it was some other, also French, politician, and by this time, C had wriggled one arm out of her top and we were all definitely friends, me, C, the nurse and the other person C already knew, plus everyone else getting vaccinated. I’ve been to weddings – loads of weddings – where there’s less fellow feeling in the room. A couple of days later, our feckless embarrassment of a prime minister told a bunch of his idiot colleagues that the vaccination rollout was a triumph for capitalism, and for greed. I already knew that the government was going to get a lot of political capital from the vaccination programme, and that they wouldn’t deserve it – that the credit would properly belong to all the people they despise, scientists, experts, NHS staff, volunteers, people who care about one another. What I did not anticipate was this nuclear-strength trolling, that he’d use a life-saving endeavour falsely as evidence not just of his own competence but his entire toxic worldview. I was, quite genuinely, amazed by the brass neck of the man. I did not think that was possible; I did not think he had any bad quality, in any amount, that would surprise me. Ever since, I’ve been waking up at 5am, just fuming, too livid to regain unconsciousness, thinking “How dare he? How dare he take all that love we have for one another, and try to parlay it into a creed of selfishness? How dare he think we’re so stupid? Why isn’t the first word of his every sentence ‘sorry’?” This is super annoying, because if I’m going to wake up before dawn, too angry to get back to sleep, I basically am 50. I should have scored myself a vaccine after all. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",2021-03-26 17:09:17+00:00,120268,2
120624,commentisfree/2021/mar/25/an-eu-ban-on-vaccine-exports-would-make-its-wretched-rollout-take-longer-still,Opinion,An EU ban on vaccine exports would make its wretched rollout take longer still | Leo Cendrowicz,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/25/an-eu-ban-on-vaccine-exports-would-make-its-wretched-rollout-take-longer-still,"When the European Union launched its vaccination campaign three months ago, all 27 member countries officially began on the same day, a move designed to showcase their unity as they fought back against Covid-19. That gesture of confident camaraderie now feels quaint as EU countries tie themselves in knots over a bungled vaccine rollout. Each week seems to bring a new setback in the jab plans, with delivery delays, safety scares and flubbed administration all combining to slow down the EU’s overall programme. Vaccination rates across the EU are a fraction of those in Britain, and way behind where the bloc had hoped to be at this stage. The EU has jabbed just 13 out of 100 people while Britain’s equivalent figure is 45, and the US is on 38. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, still says that 70% of adults can be fully vaccinated by the end of summer, but at this pace it will be well into 2022 when the EU reaches its target. As EU leaders gather on Thursday for another summit to figure their way out of their mess, officials have lighted on a new wheeze to help them speed up the process: controlling vaccine exports to countries like Britain and the US. “We want to see reciprocity and proportionality in exports, and we are ready to use whatever tool we need to deliver on that,” said Von der Leyen. There is brutal simplicity in the logic. The EU has so far exported 34m Covid-19 vaccine doses, including 10m to the UK, whose smug triumphalism about its rollout has an added sting in the already febrile post-Brexit era. These numbers have incensed people across the EU as they imagine the bloc leaching doses to everyone else. One official warned that the bloc shouldn’t be the pandemic’s “useful idiot” while others hoard and hide vaccines. Britain does not export any vaccines, and it craftily wrote clauses into its contract with the vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca to be served ahead of everyone else. As for the US, it prioritises domestic orders by drawing on the 70-year-old Defence Production Act, granting it extraordinary powers over manufacturing in times of crisis. Why can’t the EU also use the tools at its disposal? The argument for a more assertive EU policy gets louder when the travails with AstraZeneca are raised. The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant has only delivered 30m of its promised 120m doses, and yet continues to provide uninterrupted supply to Britain, even sourcing from plants in the EU. The case, however, becomes a little murkier when other aspects of the EU’s vaccine rollout, which have little to do with exports, are considered. Crucially the EU was too slow to commit itself to suppliers last year. When it did, the joint €2.7bn pot to secure 2.3bn doses was too low – the US had a purse of $18bn for its Operation Warp Speed vaccine programme. The EU also spent too much time haggling over the wrong issues, like pricing and liabilities, rather than supply and timing, a misplaced strategy that even the unabashed federalist MEP Guy Verhofstadt calls “a fiasco”. The EU approach now looks naive. Last year’s scramble was not a buyer’s market. Speed was of the essence as countries vied for priority access in the vaccine queue. These hitches go some way to explaining why the EU was already behind when it finally began its rollout last December. A number of European countries also face much higher levels of vaccine scepticism, feeding the risk-averse regulatory approach. Anti-vaxxer sentiment is particularly hostile to the AstraZeneca jab, with millions of doses now lying unused in storage. Earlier this month, concerns of a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots led to many countries briefly pausing its use, before the European Medicines Agency declared that its benefits outweighed its risks. A recent survey by YouGov showed that fewer than half of Spaniards, Italians, French and Germans thought the vaccine was safe. Ironically, the EU thundering for a fair share of AstraZeneca jabs comes as fewer Europeans actually want it.
AstraZeneca is hardly helping with its confusing efficiency data. The EU’s caution was mirrored in the US this week, whose watchdog suggested AstraZeneca was cherrypicking trial data. The company needs to be clearer about the millions of doses produced at the Helix plant in the Netherlands or the Anagni plant in Italy. The debacle over 29m doses at the Italian factory show how fraught things have become on all sides. This explains the context for the European commission’s plans to curb vaccine exports, targeting companies and countries that officials say are not playing fair. It rests on an understandable exasperation about the state of the vaccine rollout and a sense that Europeans are being played by devious countries. But an export ban would be a ham-fisted response to an already wretched predicament. The EU has been complacent, but it should also own its missteps and find better ways to redress the situation. Vaccines have complex raw-material supply chains, and some come from the countries the EU is targeting, like Britain. An export ban may at best gain about a week for the EU, but at worst, it would spark a tit-for-tat retaliation, hurting everyone. This week Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, described such an approach as retrograde: “Once you start putting up barriers, other people start putting up barriers globally.” Pfizer’s vaccine needed 280 materials from 86 suppliers in 19 countries, he said. Instead of blame-shifting, the EU should focus on improving domestic production. There is some good news on this score. The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, expects nearly 400m jabs in the next quarter, mostly from Pfizer (200m), with a further 55m from Johnson & Johnson and 35m from Moderna. Building up domestic supply will be critical in the longer term, when the EU needs boosters to deal with variants. In the meantime, the EU needs to hold its nerve. The skittish mood is throwing up many bad ideas about how to speed up the vaccine rollout, and this is spooking people further. The promised return to normalcy is taking longer than planned – but if EU leaders make the wrong move, it could drag on for longer still.

120725,commentisfree/2021/mar/24/greed-covid-vaccine-success-state-finance-nhs-,Opinion,It's not 'greed' behind the Covid vaccine success. It's state finance and the NHS | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/24/greed-covid-vaccine-success-state-finance-nhs-,"In desperate times, take what you can: in this instance, a glimmer of self-awareness from Boris Johnson. After boasting to his MPs that “the reason we have the vaccine success is because of capitalism, because of greed, my friends”, a voice within his head – or perhaps an alarmed WhatsApp message from an aide – demanded a prompt U-turn as he attempted to withdraw the comments. While his retreat speaks to concerns of image management, his instinctive advocacy of greed represents a fundamental belief. This is a man, after all, who boasted that nobody “stuck up for the bankers as much as I did” during his victorious bid for the Conservative leadership, and who once declared that inequality was essential to nurture “the spirit of envy” and that greed was a “valuable spur to economic activity”. However, ascribing Britain’s mass vaccination triumph to “greed” and “capitalism” is simply incorrect. As the British Medical Journal notes, the AstraZeneca vaccine “was originally discovered by Oxford’s Jenner Institute and has received more than a billion pounds of public money”. AstraZeneca was involved in trials and manufacture, but it took no financial risks: as it stated last year, “expenses to progress the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments”. The vaccine programme is being delivered successfully via our state-run National Health Service, while the country’s test-and-trace system has made “no clear impact”, despite private consultants charging up to £6,250 a day and Serco’s profits surging thanks to the £37bn programme. Indeed, greed and capitalism enter the equation as blocks to global vaccination. Countries such as India and South Africa, plus the World Health Organization, plead for patents on the intellectual property rights of vaccines to be waived to ensure immunisation is extended to low- and middle-income countries. This is not only for the benefit of the people of the global south – whose lives are as sacred as our own – but for humanity as a whole. As we have learned at considerable cost, allowing the virus to circulate increases the risk of dangerous mutations with resistance to existing vaccines. Our own government is among those blocking poorer nations from manufacturing their own versions. Here is greed in action. Johnson’s comments, however bungled on his own account, serve to highlight a common myth about capitalism. Cheerleaders of an economic system driven primarily by short-term profit – whatever the social or environmental cost – venerate it as an engine of innovation and entrepreneurial flair. That isn’t to deny that capitalism has played an often ingenious historic role: as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels noted in the Communist Manifesto, the capitalist class – having shattered a feudal system that represented a deadweight on human progress – had “accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals”. But today’s great achievements are often the ideas of the state and public sector. Our NHS is often forced to pay extortionate prices for drugs developed at huge public cost: in 2017, it spent £1bn on medicines developed with the help of public investment. This goes way beyond big pharma. The iPhone is a striking case study of public sector ingenuity: its touchscreen technology, GPS, battery, voice recognition – and indeed the internet as a whole was developed thanks to state research.
Given industrial scale tax avoidance on the part of so many large corporations, here is an argument that needs reiterating time and time again. Without much demonised state largesse, no company could profit. The state provides them with roads and other basic infrastructure, and protects their property. It educates their workforce and, through public healthcare, prevents them from becoming so sick they cannot work. When the financial sector imploded – the greatest private sector failure of our time – the state bailed it out, while the wider population was left paying the costs through slashed public services and social security payments. Other market failures piggyback off state generosity, too: such as a hopelessly fragmented privatised railway system which receives more state subsidies than in its nationalised epoch. As greed and capitalism pose a devastating threat to human life and the future of the planet – with private companies lobbying against clean air regulation to mitigate the consequences of pollution, which kills millions each year, along with critical environmental protections – Johnson was surely right to stumble. Britain’s vaccination programme should be lauded as it saves lives and paves the way for the restoration of our freedoms. But it is no vindication of either greed or capitalism: indeed, quite the reverse. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",2021-03-24 17:50:39+00:00,120726,2
120787,commentisfree/2021/mar/24/covid-pandemic-prepared-investment-science,Opinion,Covid won't be the last pandemic. Will we be better prepared for the next one? | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/24/covid-pandemic-prepared-investment-science,"Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we never had to face another pandemic? As we reflect on the past year, the words that come to mind are “never again”. Never again should more than 120,000 lives be lost to a contagious virus, a number that would have been unthinkable almost a year ago, when government advisers thought that losing 20,000 people would be a good outcome. Nor should we endure another year of lockdowns, and the pain of job losses and unemployment that followed. And nobody ever wants to see children taken out of school for 21 weeks of the year again, unable to learn in classrooms or see their friends. But scientists are clear that we will face another pandemic in the future. Most agree the question is when, not if. In 2018, I gave a talk at the Hay festival outlining a scenario that was loosely based on recent news reports: a farmer becomes infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacterium from a pig in China, spreading this infection through their community and then boarding a plane to the UK. The worrying thing about this scenario is that such bacteria, which evade our antibiotics of last resort, are already upon us. They could yet be the source of a future pandemic. Or perhaps the next pandemic will be caused by a virus spilling over from animals to humans, much like Covid-19. Recent reports that the first humans have been infected with avian influenza at a poultry plant in Russia give a worrying glimpse of how close we live to such risks. Every time a virus circulates among animals, particularly bats, rodents, livestock and birds, and then comes into contact with humans, there’s a chance it will infect people and lead to human transmission. Wherever the next pandemic comes from, Britain must think long term about its ability to respond and must ensure it is prepared. Key to this will be working together with other governments to establish robust response systems. Over the past year, the UK has already built many of the structures that will be needed to address a future pandemic. We now have a huge testing capacity, processes in place for fast-tracking vaccine development and protocols for undertaking rapid research in hospitals. But more needs to be done at a global level to ensure we’re truly prepared. International travel and trade have connected countries and created new opportunities for diseases to spread. This is why we need global surveillance to identify disease risks. Just as we have a weather service, governments should invest in a global virus surveillance network to scan for new pathogens of concern, and identify and mitigate the risks of animal viruses crossing over into human populations. It’s not only new pathogens we should be afraid of, but new variants of existing viruses. Already, we’ve seen variants of the virus that causes Covid-19 arising in countries such as England, Brazil and South Africa, and we could yet see the emergence of a new strain of influenza that leads to a global flu pandemic. This is why it’s essential for countries to have sequencing facilities to detect and track new strains and assess whether booster shots of vaccines are needed. Not all countries have the sequencing facilities that we benefit from in the UK, and it’s imperative we invest resources to ensure other countries also have the infrastructures that would allow them to rapidly identify and sequence new viruses. The World Bank has a particularly crucial role to play in supporting countries financially, while the World Health Organization should provide technical assistance to build up these core capacities for outbreak detection. The second crucial area of investment will be in vaccine development. While vaccines for Covid-19 have been developed and manufactured at remarkable speed, we’ll need to be even quicker next time to avoid the case numbers, deaths and restrictions we have all endured over the past year. Developing the vaccine is only half the battle: as recent tussles over limited supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have shown, countries will also need to think critically about their manufacturing capacity, and coordinate with other governments to create regional hubs that allow for mass vaccine production and delivery. We should be applying these principles not just to new viruses, but to those we already know about. Flu epidemics occur every winter and cause an estimated 650,000 deaths across the world each year, largely among young children, pregnant women and elderly adults. Pandemic influenza, which would involve the global outbreak of a new flu virus that evades our immunity, could be disastrous. The 1918 flu pandemic infected roughly one-third of the world’s population and killed 50-100 million people worldwide, while the death rate for 15-34-year-olds was 20 times higher in 1918 than in previous years. The UK government lists pandemic flu in its national risk register. Yet in planning for a flu pandemic, governments have largely focused on mitigating outbreaks by building enough hospitals to ensure people can access care, rather than on suppressing the spread of a virus while deploying a universal influenza vaccine. Our seasonal flu vaccines are given annually and are informed by expert predictions about which strains will become the most common. As the next big push after Covid-19, the UK should be aiming to develop a single-dose universal vaccine that protects against multiple influenza strains. The first human clinical trial of a universal flu vaccine has already been successfully completed, and now we must accelerate this progress.
Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, many commentators focused on the question of whether or not coronavirus was like seasonal flu. Not only did this misunderstand the unique risks of Covid-19, it also underestimated the danger of a novel flu pandemic. In the future, the UK should treat all pathogens – whether novel influenza or Covid-19 – as threats. In the process of managing Covid-19, we have inadvertently almost eliminated seasonal flu, which shows just how much we can achieve if we needed to suppress dangerous pathogens in the future. The scientific leaps that have been made over the past year, including the production of multiple vaccines and treatments for Covid-19, can seem like magic. In fact, these advances reflect years of research and training building on the work of previous scientists. Historic breakthroughs, such as the discovery of penicillin in 1928, the polio vaccine in 1961 and the MMR vaccine in 1963, were possible because of the work of multiple scientists, biologists, virologists, geneticists, engineers and mathematicians. The same goes for the response to Covid-19. The importance of science has never been more obvious, and governments should be pouring resources into the sector rather than pulling back. News that the government plans to cut the budget of UK research funding, which will cost the sector an estimated £1bn and deal a serious blow to science, is particularly concerning. Now is the time to invest in science and research. It’s only by doing this that we’ll be truly prepared when the next pandemic arrives.

Emblazoned on the back over the subverted pink triangle that came to be a symbol of the gay community’s fight for liberation were the words: “IF I DIE OF AIDS – FORGET BURIAL – JUST DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF THE FDA.” These words have echoed through the decades, transmitted and mutating, cultural commentators have noted, like a virus: “IF I DIE IN POLICE CUSTODY …”; “IF I DIE IN A SCHOOL SHOOTING …” A year ago, the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power, Act Up, the grassroots group dedicated to ending the Aids pandemic through political and artistic activism, and who put on a “political funeral” for Wojnarowicz when he died of Aids at the age of 37 in 1992, posted a new manifestation online: “IF I DIE OF COVID-19 – FORGET BURIAL DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF MAR-A-LAGO.” We are a year in, but in terms of Covid’s artistic impact, it’s obviously early days. On the one hand, the potential for great art is huge: the grief and the fury is ripe for channelling. “No, #COVID19 isn’t AIDS but the parallels are clear as day,” Act Up NY tweeted in March last year. “Vulnerable communities are taking the brunt of this pandemic due to overwhelming neglect. All the barriers in place (healthcare, pharma greed, housing, stigma, etc) that have kept HIV alive will keep this virus alive.” Yet there is also fatigue and an unwillingness to engage with any form of cultural response to the pandemic. Online, it has become fashionable to express dread about the slew of Covid novels, art, TV shows or films that will emerge. “I completely understand why the Spanish Flu was rarely if ever mentioned in 1920s literature and art. I do not want to watch any TV shows/movies or read a single novel about this fucking time,” tweeted the writer Rebecca Fishbein this week (340,000+ likes). She then added: “I can assure all of you that even if every single movie/film/book were exclusively about Covid going forward, humanity would still learn no lessons. See: Holocaust.” Perhaps it is unfair for me to single out the sentiments of a lone writer, but her words are symptomatic of a view that I have now seen and heard expressed countless times, both online and off, and they raise some interesting questions. Is the purpose of art to teach us lessons? Did not the Holocaust provoke a major 20th-century artistic shift? In asking the question, “how do we make art after Auschwitz?” ways of moving forward were found. The rise of abstraction resulted. And what about Primo Levi, Charlotte Salomon or Gerhard Richter, among others? The art and literature of the second world war, and the Great War before it, were a necessary processing of the trauma of mass death and destruction.
It is true that, as Fishbein notes, Spanish flu was called “the forgotten pandemic”. The reason usually cited for this artistic void is that it was overshadowed by the first world war. Certain works, of course, do come to mind: Edvard Munch’s two self-portraits, one of him with the Spanish flu, the other after he had recovered; Egon Schiele’s drawings: one of Gustav Klimt on his deathbed before he succumbed to the flu following a stroke, another, in 1918, of his dying pregnant wife Edith – Schiele himself would die several days after Edith and their unborn child, leaving behind his haunting unfinished painting The Family. There was literature, too, most notably in the 1930s, which saw The Doctor’s Son, a short story by John O’Hara, They Came Like Swallows by William Maxwell, and Pale Horse, Pale Rider by Katherine Anne Porter, which was inspired by Porter’s own experience of almost dying from influenza. However, the way the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic synthesised in cultural works was far more subtle than simple depiction. From the clean, hygienic lines of the Bauhaus and 1920s architecture – Charles Jencks said that “the deep metaphor of modernism was that of the operating theatre, the hospital, of a place where the difficulties of everyday life could be fumigated out” – to the morbid absurdism of dadaism, it cast a shadow. In literature, the pandemic can be “contact traced” again through modernism: Mrs Dalloway, The Waste Land, The Second Coming – it’s a spectre in all of them. This is the thesis of Elizabeth Outka’s Viral Modernism: The Influenza Pandemic and Interwar Literature. Outka speculates that the Spanish flu manifests spectrally because trauma itself is spectral – people remember it “diffusely”. And diseases, of course, are invisible. Furthermore, as Virginia Woolf notes in her essay On Being Ill, illnesses are essentially “plotless”: “the public,” she writes, “would say that a novel devoted to influenza lacked plot.” So where does this all leave us, in terms of making and consuming cultural products? Friends who work in television and publishing tell me that editors and commissioners are approaching works that deal with Covid with caution, suspecting that the public desperately want cheering up and a return to normality. One contact tells me that TV commissioners keep saying they “want works that feel like sinking into a warm bath”. Is this repression, or could it be that we are still in the midst of the trauma? Perhaps, like the art of the Spanish flu pandemic, Covid will make itself known artistically as a sort of shadow spectre, or perhaps, as with much of the art of the Aids pandemic, it will operate powerfully at the intersection of art and activism. The political rage is there, and if not the same degree of stigma and marginalisation faced by queer artists, the suffering of vulnerable people has been great indeed. There has been enormous grief, too. Forgive me for sounding like an armchair psychologist for a moment, but it has to come out somehow.

120873,commentisfree/2021/mar/24/trust-britain-covid-vaccine-compromise,Opinion,"Europe's trust in Britain has gone. We're now a problem, not a partner | Rafael Behr",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/24/trust-britain-covid-vaccine-compromise,"The pandemic is landing well-aimed punches on the already bruised relationship between Britain and the European Union. A dispute over vaccine supplies threatens to bring blunt instruments of trade war down on delicate national feelings. Not in the darkest hours of Brexit negotiations did either side imagine that supply-chain management would so quickly become a matter of life and death. At a summit later this week, European leaders will discuss a possible ban on exports to the UK from an AstraZeneca plant in the Netherlands. There is frustration in Brussels that millions of vaccine doses have gone overseas (mostly Pfizer ones) and none have come over in return. The UK responds that it cannot be blamed for moving earlier, signing better contracts and generally getting its immunising act together faster. Tory MPs say Brussels is lashing out in jealousy. Vaccination is something Boris Johnson’s government is doing well, and the EU is floundering. That has less to do with Brexit than is claimed by triumphant ministers, but as propaganda the point is irresistible: there is nothing else to trumpet as a benefit of detachment from the continent, and winning the vaccination race resonates with voters grateful for jabs. UK politicians overestimate how much time is spent in Brussels thinking about Brexit. The peak of trauma and caring came immediately after the referendum. There was a phase of anxiety that the separatist impulse might be contagious. That passed when Westminster curled itself into a writhing ball, unable to digest the reality of what the electorate had ordered. No one who saw that from inside the EU fancied a portion of what Britain was having. What comes across to Tory ministers as a vendetta is actually something much less attentive. It is being a “third country” – the legal designation of an external state whose needs are always subordinate to the collective interests of the bloc. At Brussels summits, Britain’s third-country status is more relevant than its G7 economy, its permanent seat on the UN security council and its nuclear arsenal. London isn’t used to thinking of itself as junior to Ljubljana in EU affairs, but that is what Brexit means. Specifically, it is Johnson’s Brexit. He pulped the chapters in Theresa May’s deal that would have made good on her pledge of a “deep and special partnership”. The adjustment was more than tonal. It was an ideological choice with immediate consequences: rivalry over alignment, competition before cooperation. Those priorities are baked into Johnson’s trade deal. Diplomatic bridges were burned and back channels blocked to make a point about regulatory freedom. Leavers always exaggerate the UK’s reach as a solo global trader, but the country’s disruptive potential as a commercial rival parked off the French coast is real enough. That is why Brussels drove such a hard bargain on single-market access. In terms of size, Britain is in the sour spot relative to the EU: too small to be an equal, too big to be a client; not powerful enough to assert its will in trade negotiations but hefty enough to cause trouble. That is a blueprint for relations on a downward spiral, which neither side wants or knows how to avert. Johnson has called for a cooperative front against a third Covid wave. Many EU national leaders are not sold on the Commission’s threat of a vaccine export ban. Compromise on AstraZeneca is available. But in the longer term, the tensions are structural and hard to overcome when all reserves of trust are spent. Europeans have learned to disregard what Johnson says and focus on what he does. If he were serious about a cooperative spirit he would not, for example, be refusing to apply the full terms of the withdrawal agreement in Northern Ireland. Reliable partners do not sign treaties with their fingers crossed. If the British prime minister valued respectful dialogue, he would not have refused full diplomatic status to the EU’s ambassador. Most EU governments want a closer relationship with Britain. Some have economic motives. Others, notably eastern members with Russian sabres rattling at their borders, value the UK’s defence and security capabilities. But none will put relations with a third country – not even an old friend – ahead of internal EU relations. And since there is no prospect of pro-Europeans staging a comeback at Westminster, the default setting is to treat Britain as a problem to be contained, not a partner to be consulted. Ministers resent that label because they see themselves as running a big country that matters, but the Tory benches are not stocked with people who would know how to begin rebuilding influence in Brussels. Brexit was a closed chapter for many Europeans when Britain was still bickering over whether it should go ahead. There were bigger and more urgent challenges even before the pandemic made everything harder: internal tensions over budgets and fiscal transfers; moral quandaries over the rule of law in rogue members that are hollowing out their democracies; strategic dilemmas facing a new superpower rivalry between the US and China; migration control; the climate emergency. Britain may yet claim a stake in many of those conversations, but it has forfeited its place at the table. That is a loss on both sides of the Channel. Many smaller EU members used to rely on the UK, as one of the bloc’s top three heavy-hitters, to make the case for financial prudence and respect for national differentiation. Britain was the pre-eminent non-eurozone member and an internal counterweight to federalising and centralising impulses. Removing that voice inevitably alters the character of the project.
British diplomats and officials were admired for bringing pragmatism and rational scepticism to conversations where there would otherwise have been a bit too much integrationist theology. That is partly why Brexit came as such a shock. How could a nation of sceptics be so credulous as to swallow leave-campaign fictions? How could a pragmatic people submit to something so flagrantly impractical? The EU was quick to see that Brexit was a lose-lose proposition, but the cost to Britain was obviously greater and easier to count in terms of trade and influence. The damage done to the European project is more subtle and insidious. It is a slow burn. Grief at the separation was overtaken by frustration and impatience during the bungled exit process. Relief at finalising the divorce and the need to get on with other things has meant deferring the audit of what the EU will miss. No one is measuring the UK-shaped hole in Europe. On that score, Johnson’s consequential victory was not the defeat of enthusiastic pro-Europeans, who had not been a dominant cultural force, but the annihilation of rational Eurosceptics. It was the banishment of moderate Tories and the scorching of earth beneath anyone who could see flaws in the EU but wanted to address them from the inside, because membership still served the national interest. The extinction of that tribe is a tragedy for British politics, but it is also a loss to the rest of Europe. And the cost has yet to be counted.

121309,commentisfree/2021/apr/30/government-delays-covid-public-inquiry-health-crisis,Opinion,"The government dithers and delays, but the UK needs a Covid public inquiry now | Marcus Shepheard",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/30/government-delays-covid-public-inquiry-health-crisis,"It is time for a public inquiry. The coronavirus crisis has been an extraordinary period for the UK, and the toll substantial. More than 127,000 people have died, children have lost years of education, and we have seen the largest drop in GDP since consistent records began more than half a century ago. There have been myriad other harms to individual livelihoods, and to wellbeing. Much of this flows from decisions made in Whitehall. While the government has done some things well – the vaccine programme is an undisputed success so far – there are sincere, legitimate questions about many of its other choices. International comparisons are imperfect. Even still, on almost every measure the UK has performed worse than similar nations, suggesting that things could have been different. Understanding how decisions were made, and specific choices taken, is important and can only be gained through a comprehensive, independent public inquiry. The prime minister has promised such an inquiry, though only in vague terms. He should announce it now. This will allow time for a national debate around what it should cover, for terms of reference to be set, and for the inquiry itself to be set up. Contrary to the prime minister’s repeated assertions, this would not distract from the his government’s work of managing the crisis now. It is unlikely that an inquiry would call witnesses before the winter. But the longer the government waits, the longer the wait for accountability. Crucially, it also delays any lessons that can be learned to help the government manage the next crisis better (or a resurgence of Covid in the UK, though we all desperately hope this won’t be the case). The government missed opportunities to do this between the first and second waves of the pandemic; it should not make this mistake again. The lack of an inquiry has created a vacuum in the discourse around the crisis. This has been filled with a briefing war, and a blame game of anonymous comments and contradictory statements. This is unhelpful and only undermines public confidence. Accountability matters. Despite what the government says, investigations by the National Audit Office or parliamentary select committees – while all valuable – are no substitute for a public inquiry. They do not have the powers, remit and independence to investigate what happened and present a truthful account of this to the public: an inquiry, chaired by a judge and supported by an expert panel, would. This is the right way to do accountability.
This inquiry needs to look closely at how decisions were made. What was the state of knowledge at the time? Whose views shaped the choices made by ministers, including the prime minister, and officials? Equally, what were the choices not made? Some of this has been made public – Sage has published its minutes, and other records have been shared (or leaked). But again these are no substitute for an inquiry. Setting the breadth of the inquiry will be a challenge, with so much ground to cover. Big strategic decisions around lockdowns, school closures and international travel intertwine with operational decisions in the NHS, procurement and testing programmes. There are also questions around the joint decision-making between the devolved administrations and Whitehall, which after a strong start deteriorated over the summer of 2020. Inquiries can be powerful tools for change and their recommendations are, or at least should be, taken seriously. However, there are too many examples where they are not implemented. Sometimes this is due to political resistance, but other times it is simply due to a lack of oversight. Things get forgotten, people move on and nobody keeps track of the work. The scale of this crisis demands better. The terms of reference for inquiry should include a clear accountability mechanism. This would identify other institutions that can scrutinise the government’s follow-up on the recommendations. Parliamentary select committees are one – they should hold ministers and officials accountable for progress on their implementation. The government should also commit, from the outset, to transparent reporting of how it is changing as a result. Members of the inquiry – in particular the nonjudicial figures of any panel – also need to become public advocates for this work even after its core investigative function has ended. A coronavirus inquiry will not be easy, or quick, but it is vital. The prime minister should act now.

A bill to be set out in the Queen’s speech next month, and accompanied by a national digital strategy, will make official what has been on the cards for some time. England’s more than 100 clinical commissioning groups are to be replaced by 44 (or possibly 42) integrated care systems, with a remit to commission health and social care, working with local authorities. Existing rules on competitive tendering will be relaxed. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England’s boss for seven years, will step down in July. His replacement will have less power, as the service’s independence is reduced and powers to direct it are pulled back by ministers. Sir Simon has accepted a seat in the House of Lords and so is not, it appears, going to vanish from the scene (an intriguing possibility is that he could, at some point, become a minister). But with questions being asked about how long Matt Hancock is likely to remain as health secretary, the situation for the whole health and care system is extremely precarious. The already stretched NHS workforce is exhausted, with 90,000 vacancies and warnings that working conditions may lead to an exodus. Data on Covid deaths, hospital admissions and positive test results, along with vaccination rates, offer some grounds for optimism – albeit in the context of disasters unfolding elsewhere, particularly in India. But the pandemic is far from over. Around 1 million people in the UK have long Covid and more than 1,600 remain ill in hospital. On Monday, the prime minister said that a third wave of infections is possible, whether or not new variants turn out to be able to evade immune responses. Meanwhile, waiting lists are exploding, as the temporary suppression of demand for other services and treatments comes to an end. The number of patients having planned surgery dropped by 4.6 million last year, while GPs referred 6 million fewer people for hospital tests or treatment. One thinktank has warned that the number of people waiting could rise to nearly 10 million by 2024. The social care funding question cannot be put off for ever. One floor of a shopping centre in Bournemouth has been repurposed as a “health pop-up village”. Short-term fixes aside, the question is whether, and how, a major reorganisation can be engineered in the midst of a crisis. While regional consolidation could – and should – bring benefits, the danger is that the new bodies will be rapidly overwhelmed by a combination of staffing problems, Covid and waiting lists. In a context in which the NHS has no means of meeting patients’ needs, with political pressure mounting in the buildup to a general election, there will be strong pressure to outsource care and sell patient data. The process by which a successor to Sir Simon is chosen is crucial. There is no organisation that means more to the public than the NHS. Its leader must not be a yes man or woman, or a crony. Following the Greensill scandal, the public will be rightly suspicious. Ministers should seek to prove them wrong, and use this period of relative calm to prepare for an unpredictable future.",2021-04-29 17:40:36+00:00,121431,16
121794,commentisfree/2021/apr/28/compulsory-covid-jabs-care-home-staff-last-resort,Opinion,"Compulsory Covid jabs for care home staff? As a last resort, it makes sense | Frances Ryan",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/28/compulsory-covid-jabs-care-home-staff-last-resort,"One of the abiding memories of the early days of the pandemic was care homes ravaged by coronavirus. A year on, the government has launched a consultation that could lead to staff in facilities for older people in England being required to have a Covid-19 vaccine in a bid to protect vulnerable residents. This would have been a last resort for ministers. It is uncomfortable to mandate any form of healthcare, and more so when you consider it’s disproportionately people of colour and those from deprived backgrounds who are hesitant about the jab. Yet several months on since the vaccine rollout started, evidence shows outreach to reluctant carers isn’t getting through: staff vaccination rates are still below 70% in 27 different local authorities in England despite care workers being in the highest priority category for the jabs. Only about half of care homes have enough people vaccinated to provide minimum protection against the virus. That’s the equivalent of 150,000 older people who are currently unsafe. It has been striking, then, to see the ease in which the proposal is being dismissed in some quarters. Unison, the UK’s largest union for public service workers, described the idea of compulsory vaccines as “sinister” and a form of “bullying”. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson previously called the proposed move “discriminatory”. Meanwhile, the GMB union has warned compulsory vaccines will impose “unnecessary anxiety” on care staff. We are hearing much less about the “sinister” sight of elderly people being exposed to potentially infected care workers. Similarly, we have heard little about the “anxiety” residents would suffer if carers were left unvaccinated, be it the grandmother living in fear each day, not knowing if her carer is infectious, or the 80-year-old with dementia, hospitalised with coronavirus, pulling his oxygen mask off in distress because he doesn’t understand what’s happening. Care workers – who have sacrificed so much during the pandemic – deserve to have their concerns listened to, and unions have a duty to protect them, particularly those who can’t be immunised for medical reasons. Employers and the government must take all practical steps to help already pressured and underpaid care workers take up the jab voluntarily, including paid time off for any side-effects. But compulsory vaccinations are surely a valid last resort to protect clinically vulnerable people. Allowing staff to walk into a care home unvaccinated in the middle of a pandemic is, by any definition, a form of neglect.
It is telling that this debate is being centred on the right of care staff to refuse a vaccine and not the right of older people to live. Culturally, we perceive people in care homes as passive recipients of treatment rather than autonomous adults with rights, just as we routinely see the lives of older and disabled people as holding less value. The same prejudices that saw some older and disabled people wrongly given “do not resuscitate” orders at the start of the pandemic now sees them as collateral damage to care staff’s “rights” and “choices”. Many of the arguments defending unvaccinated care staff are, in fact, deeply flawed. For example, it’s often said that it’s unnecessary to vaccinate staff if all residents have the jab. But elderly people are most likely to produce a weak immune response to the jab, meaning staff being inoculated as well as residents offers easy and vital added protection. A new study shows a single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce transmission of the virus by up to half. Besides, carers v residents is a false binary; staff with asthma or low immunity will want to know their colleagues are vaccinated too. There are warnings that compulsory Covid jabs would “threaten standards of care” in an already strained sector by hindering recruitment. But this has the issue backwards. Letting underpaid and overworked carers avoid vaccinations will not improve staff numbers – better working conditions and higher pay will. Compulsory jabs have also repeatedly been called “unprecedented” but this doesn’t provide the full picture. Some leading care providers have already issued their own “no jab, no job” policy. While there are no existing mandatory vaccines for staff in the UK, some healthcare workers are contractually obliged to get the hepatitis B jab and other vaccines, particularly if they work in high-risk settings. There is no inalienable right to every job; if you want to work with vulnerable people, you must accept the duty of care that comes with it. Rather than resisting mandating vaccines for care workers, we should be asking why the move won’t be applied to other workers in the sector. The government is only considering compulsory jabs for staff in care homes for older people, meaning younger disabled people would not be protected. This is despite the fact people with a learning disability in England are dying from Covid at six times the rate of the general population. Compulsory vaccines would also only apply to care workers and not health sector staff; nearly 15% of NHS workers in England remain unvaccinated, and the numbers coming forward for a jab have decreased sharply in recent weeks. These are not easy conversations to have, but this difficulty is no justification to turn away. Almost 29,000 people in care homes in England have lost their lives due to Covid – each of them human beings with names, sons and daughters and grandchildren. The existence of safe, accessible vaccines means ministers have every chance to avoid such horrors from repeating themselves. It is not an exaggeration to say lives depend on it.

121829,commentisfree/2021/apr/28/political-leaders-covid-vaccines-rich,Opinion,Political leaders must ensure Covid vaccines aren’t the preserve of the rich  | Jeremy Farrar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/28/political-leaders-covid-vaccines-rich,"In the last few days, major powers have responded to the horrific crisis unfolding in India. The US government’s decision to share 10m vaccine doses within weeks, and up to 50m more over the summer, is welcome and urgently needed. New Zealand, Norway and France have also responded to the demand for vaccines to be shared fairly around the world. But frankly, no country is acting on the scale that is necessary. This pandemic is a long way from over. The scenes in India, where Covid-19 continues to overwhelm health systems and sink the economy, are harrowing. In many countries, hospitals are flooded with patients and face shortages of vital medical supplies. At a global level, I fear the worst is yet to come. Across the world, there have been almost 100,000 reported deaths in the 10 days since the global total passed the 3m mark. Because of a lack of data collection, the true figure is likely much higher. Each death is a tragedy, the loss of a loved one, an untold story. Why, when we have vaccines and treatments for Covid, are we still seeing horrific reports of this virus raging through communities? The responsibility for this lies with global political leaders. While science has made significant progress, producing vaccines, treatments and tests in record time, the G20 have failed to come together and back the sustained global response that is desperately needed. This puts our hard-won scientific progress at risk. Science is only useful if it’s delivered to society. Until vaccines and tests for Covid are available to everyone, we won’t be able to stop this pandemic and its devastating consequences. Ensuring the world’s population has access is the best way to drive down transmission, reduce deaths and prevent dangerous new variants from emerging.
It is simply not acceptable that while an estimated one in four people in high-income countries have received a Covid vaccine, just one in 500 have received the jab in low-income countries, or that hospitals in poorer countries are still struggling to access basic supplies like oxygen, sedatives and PPE. Healthcare workers in every country, who are putting themselves at risk to protect us all, must be first in line for vaccinations. Right now, global political leaders are the only people who can make these essential resources available. Rich countries – including the UK and US – have bought up the majority of existing vaccine supplies. They urgently need to start sharing these doses with the rest of the world, alongside national rollouts in their own countries, and through the Covax programme. And they must set out a timetable for how these donations will be increased as they vaccinate more of their populations domestically. The UK is in the perfect position to lead these efforts through its G7 presidency. Half of our population – including those who are most at risk from Covid – have had at least one dose of the vaccine. In fact, the UK has given almost as many doses to its own citizens as Covax has been able to ship to 120 countries in dire need of jabs. Covax and the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator are ready to make vaccines and vital medicines available where they are most needed, but they can only deliver these with real support from political leaders. Vaccinating the whole world isn’t just the morally right thing to do – it’s in every nation’s scientific, public health and economic self-interest. The shores Covid now rages upon may seem distant to some, but the reality is that so long as the virus continues to spread in other countries, it continues to be a threat to everyone. If we allow Covid to keep spreading, it will go on evolving, increasing the risk of new variants that could cross borders and evade vaccines and treatments. With global infections at an all-time high, this is a very real risk. We are playing with fire. The first vaccines cannot be the preserve of the rich. At the same time, science needs to keeps pace with the evolving virus and develop the next generation of vaccines that will protect against future waves and variants. This will require building up manufacturing capacity globally, and combining all the tools needed to fight the virus: public health, honest communication, tests, sequencing, oxygen, PPE, treatments and vaccines. We have made remarkable progress in developing the crucial first vaccines, treatments and tests over the last year – driven in large part by the work of the ACT-Accelerator. This initiative still needs $19bn (£13.5bn) to finish driving the science forward and ensure these benefits are distributed equitably around the world – a tiny amount compared to the trillions governments are spending on stimulus packages to address the economic consequences of Covid. If countries who can afford to share choose not to, this pandemic will drag on, resulting in more deaths, suffering and economic hardship. We’re in danger of creating a fragmented, unequal world of haves and have-nots, where it will be far harder to come together and address the shared challenges of this century. We can exit this crisis and turn Covid into a treatable and preventable disease in 2021. But we’ll only be able to do this if all countries benefit equitably from scientific advances in treating the virus, and if science has sufficient support to keep up as the virus evolves. There can be no more delays or excuses. The longer we wait, the worse it will be for all of us. The world’s political leaders have a choice to make. It should be an easy one.

Even as an epidemiologist, whose bread and butter is dealing in numbers, I’ve had to stop myself every so often during the last year and make a deliberate effort to gain perspective on the scale of it all. I’ve needed to remind myself that these are not just numbers of infections and deaths that we are hearing about every day, these are people’s lives. It’s easy to forget that behind every number is a person, and behind every person is family.
I think we need to remember this as we try and make sense of the scale of the humanitarian disaster in India. With more than 300,000 cases a day and over 2,000 deaths for five straight days, the figures are almost impossible to get your head around. The true number of cases per day may be up to 10 times higher than this, so we’re potentially talking about millions of cases. And the number of deaths is almost certainly underreported, but by exactly how much is anyone’s guess. And it’s only going to get worse, much worse, with the peak potentially being many weeks away. Why we’re seeing this level of disease transmission in India is not a question with an easy answer, and no doubt there are many factors that have contributed to this. Whatever the reasons, what we need focus on as a global community is, however, how we can help. A significant amount of much needed resources are being committed to India right now from many countries around the world, including from Australia. It highlights that no one is underestimating the magnitude of this disaster, and countries are prepared to assist, despite the considerable challenges many of them are facing at home. The willingness to help also reflects the knowledge that what is happening in India has significant implications in terms of controlling transmission globally. Unless we bring transmission under control in all countries, particularly one with 1.3 billion people, we will never overcome the pandemic. Australia has a number of difficult issues to grapple with during this emerging crisis. The most challenging issue concerns our responsibility to the approximately 9,000 Australians who are in India and want to come home. When considering these individuals it’s important to remember a couple of things. First, these are fellow citizens, who mostly through no fault of their own have found themselves trapped. Second, we are not a few months into this pandemic, we are more than a year into it. That we haven’t been able to bring those back who have wanted to come back from any country, let alone one in which their very safety is now threatened, isn’t something that should rest easy with any of us.
No one should understate that this is a difficult issue. There are competing obligations to protect what we have fought so hard for in Australia and the obligation to look after our own citizens wherever they may be and whatever circumstances they find themselves in. Given the very real threat to the health of those who are trapped in India, this is very much a moral issue. This complex problem can be boiled down to one fundamental question: how much risk are we willing to tolerate as a community to look after Australians who are in need and stranded in India? With the temporary block on travel from India, announced by prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday, it seems this answer is that we are not willing to tolerate any risk, at least until 15 May, when the decision will be reviewed. The suitability or not of Australia’s existing quarantine arrangements, and in particular hotel quarantine, is at the heart of this dilemma. If we truly had confidence in hotel quarantine, this would not be an issue. If we all felt confident that we could bring Australians back with little risk of virus escaping into the community, then we would simply bring people back as quickly as we could, regardless of other considerations. Notwithstanding the concession that no one can expect perfection in hotel quarantine – or any other system of quarantine, for that matter – the reality is that we clearly don’t have enough faith in the current system. Whether this lack of faith is justified is confusing, depending on who you listen to. The contrasting opinions reflect the messiness of this whole situation and the muddled relationship between state and federal governments in managing this system. Federally, one feels there is a hope that this problem will go away with the rollout of the vaccine. As vulnerable groups are immunised and vaccine coverage of the population increases, the implications of escapes from quarantine are much reduced. But of course we all know the vaccine is taking longer to deliver than we had hoped, and along with supply issues, vaccine hesitancy and the effectiveness of vaccines to new variants there are going to be a number of bumps along the way to achieving sufficient vaccine coverage of the population to impact on the level of threat the virus poses to the population.
So with all this considered, it may be time to think about the long game here. While doing everything we can to prevent future escapes from hotel quarantine – which we are going to have to rely on for some time to come, regardless of future decisions – it may be the time, as many are calling for, to invest in the future and set up purpose-built quarantine centres that can cope with higher volumes of people coming from severely-affected countries. There is only one thing for sure here in a world of uncertainty that we all living in, and that is that this pandemic is going to be with us for a while yet, and that it’s not the last pandemic we will face.

121974,commentisfree/2021/apr/27/long-covid-psychology-treat-body-brain,Opinion,Long Covid is very far from ‘all in the mind’ – but psychology can still help us treat it | Carmine M Pariante,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/27/long-covid-psychology-treat-body-brain,"As the UK nears what will hopefully be the end of lockdowns and high death tolls, our doctors and nurses are left to deal with a worrying secondary aspect of the pandemic in the shape of long Covid. There are more than 1 million people with long Covid in the UK alone, amounting to a human and medical emergency, with potentially a huge impact on society and the workforce. A clinical picture is emerging, with many patients reporting similar symptoms including shortness of breath, difficulty in concentration, body aches, persistent fatigue and other symptoms. The illness has been recognised in the US, Europe and elsewhere. Moreover, long Covid has parallels with CFS/ME, a debilitating condition that has similar symptoms. Unfortunately, in the face of all this suffering, advances in science and clinical care are being jeopardised by an antiquated and unhelpful debate on whether these symptoms are “in the mind”, as if they were a fantasy or a dream. Of course, long Covid and CFS/ME symptoms are not in the mind. No symptoms are. Unfortunately some people with CFS/ME or, more recently long Covid, have been dismissed by health professionals. Some patients might have felt not taken seriously by their doctor while others might have lost the opportunity to benefit from a broader, psychosocial approach. I am a medical researcher and clinician who specialises in the biological communication between the body and the brain. I can assure you that every symptom and every disorder, regardless of whether it is called mental or physical, is characterised by measurable biological changes in the body and in the brain. We may not know yet if these changes are the cause of the symptoms, but these biological changes are very real even if we cannot fully understand them. Interestingly, the same biological mechanisms can often be triggered by diverse events. Both life events and infections activate the immune system, with common effects on the brain and the body, resulting in both depression and fatigue. It is not at all surprising that most patients with CFS/ME recognise either a severe life event or an infection at the onset of their illness. Indeed, even the historical distinction between a mental and a physical disorder is fuzzy when we look at individuals rather than clinical labels. This distinction was never intended to explain the cause of a disorder but rather to describe its main manifestations: that is, abnormal emotions or behaviour for mental disorders versus abnormal functions of the heart, the lungs or other organs for physical disorders. Moreover, mental and physical disorders are often present together in the same person. Many people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes also have depression, and there are many other similar combinations of diseases. Mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, have measurable biological changes not only in the brain but also in the body: changes in the blood, saliva and urine, in the heart and the digestive systems. The idea that there is a clear mental health versus physical health distinction has changed in recent years toward treating the health of the person as a whole. The fact that all symptoms and disorders have underlying biological changes does not diminish the strong evidence that symptoms and disorders can be influenced by “psychological factors”. Many people fully acknowledge that our health can be influenced by what happens in our lives and how we feel about those things – both negative and positive. Stressful life events, such as bereavement, unemployment, incidents of abuse and violence, poverty or discrimination, can precipitate or exacerbate both mental and physical disorders. These events can lead to hypertension, an autoimmune flare-up, a cardiovascular problem or depression. Why would we want to separate these health impacts and put depression, or any mental disorder, in a separate box to the rest? Conversely, changes in lifestyle and behaviour, and psychological therapies (which work by challenging unhelpful ways we think about ourselves and world around us), have been shown to help patients with physical disorders including cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and stroke, to name just a few. This point is particularly important in the context of CFS/ME and, more recently, long Covid. Offering lifestyle changes or psychotherapeutic approaches to these patients does not mean that their symptoms are “not real”. Medics routinely help cancer patients with these approaches every day, yet I never hear anyone accusing doctors of suggesting cancer is all in the mind. There is also good evidence that all types of symptoms can be influenced by anticipation and beliefs, as has been demonstrated many times with the powerful placebo and “nocebo” effects. Being offered something believed to be positive (for example, an empty capsule that we believe to contain a medication) or negative (an empty capsule we believe to contain a toxin) will make our symptoms better (placebo) or, respectively, worse (nocebo). This is not snake oil for the gullible: these are biological effects based on measurable changes in the brain and the body, and can occur in everybody. This is why the standard evaluation of a novel treatment for any disorder – including the very real Covid infection – requires a comparison with a dummy treatment, so that our expectations, positive or negative, do not influence the results. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of the recent controversy around a Guardian article on this topic, and the response it has received. Patients being told their symptoms are in their mind is completely unacceptable to every doctor I know, and such attitudes have no place in modern medicine. But this dismissive approach has nothing to do with the important clinical understanding that psychological factors and approaches can influence these conditions, as they do any other illness. Those who reject the notion that psychological approaches can help us better understand and treat physical symptoms are themselves falling, perhaps inadvertently, into the trap of differentiating and stigmatising mental illness. We need every tool in the box to treat long Covid – and it must be hoped that the new focus and funding on this condition may also provide us with new and useful insights into treating CFS/ME patients.

121987,commentisfree/2021/apr/27/g7-end-vaccine-apartheid,Opinion,The G7 must act to end 'vaccine apartheid' or everyone in the world will suffer | Rowan Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/27/g7-end-vaccine-apartheid,"Until the later part of the 19th century, what we regard today as the fundamentals of public health were mostly unknown. Clean water and public sanitation systems in cities, access to basic professional support for women in childbirth, hygiene in hospitals and operating theatres – all these and many more such provisions took time to arrive on the scene in Europe and North America, and it often took a disastrous epidemic, or a massive loss of life that could be correlated with the lack of these provisions, to spur reformers and governments to take the necessary measures. Future generations will look back with incredulity at our failure so far to do what is necessary for global public health in the course of this pandemic. We know that certain groups, such as frontline workers and those forced to live in overcrowded housing, are made more vulnerable to infection. But as the tragic scenes in India right now demonstrate, the virus fundamentally is blind to politics, class, race or geography. Like the climate crisis, it does not read maps or need passports. Piecemeal response is ineffectual and the idea that certain enclaves can simply throw up walls around themselves is fantasy. If the bitter struggles and confusions of the past 13 months have shown us anything, surely they have shown us this. We have been reminded as never before in our lifetimes that our safety and our neighbours’ safety are inseparable. Investment in the health of others is not simply a moral imperative indulged in by armchair philanthropists or rootless idealists. It is investment in a shared future. Dispassionate economists have calculated that the cost to the G7 nations of making vaccines universally available would not only be a minute fraction of the trillions already earmarked for post-Covid economic recovery, but would result in net gains of some $466bn to G7 economies over the next four or five years. Conversely, a failure to respond adequately would drive vulnerable economies further into decline or chaos, leading to global instability as states face failure and populations drift in search of some kind of economic security. Crucially, as bad as this is, it would be massively worsened by the continuing threat of infection and the prospect of that endless Groundhog Day scenario that we have learned to fear – being forced back again and again into emergency measures to limit damage and protect health services. The call that is being made by the People’s Vaccine Alliance, reinforced by a call from the leaders of various religious groups, is that this year’s G7 summit should make an unambiguous commitment to provide vaccines now to all countries, irrespective of their financial standing; to guarantee a continuing programme of vaccination that will produce manageable levels of immunity; and to support the short-term waiver of patents that will allow the rapid localisation of vaccine production outside the world’s wealthier countries. People have begun to talk not only about “vaccine nationalism” but about “vaccine apartheid” – an ugly term for an ugly reality where, for example, less than 1% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa have been injected. The pandemic has already been a tragedy of enormous proportions, it would be far worse if we refused to face the uncomfortable facts that it has uncovered – the unpalatable truths about global injustices and inequalities, as well as the serious inequalities within prosperous nations. We have no excuse for not recognising these things, and no alibi for refusing to act on this recognition.
Much work has already gone into spelling out the various mechanisms by which funds could be made available. More importantly, perhaps, the last year has shown again and again the readiness of so many people across the world to act in a way that acknowledges our dependence on one another. What is needed now is to extend that generous and realistic spirit from local communities to the entire community of the world’s nations. In the 19th century, governments in the wealthier world gradually came to understand that health was a genuine public good. The health of each and the health of all were seen as inseparably connected. So it is today: we are challenged to see global health as a universal common good – not a benefit that can be cultivated for a privileged few. The G7 meeting, which is to be held in the United Kingdom between 11 and 13 June, has the power to declare that a shared world and social environment mean shared access to health and protection. The security, and indeed the human dignity, that we claim for ourselves means nothing if it is not open to all.

122043,commentisfree/2021/apr/27/rich-countries-covid-pandemic-death-developing-nations,Opinion,Rich countries close their eyes to the global covid surge at their own peril | Laura Spinney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/27/rich-countries-covid-pandemic-death-developing-nations,"Is there one pandemic, or two? That was a question being asked a year ago, when wealthy countries accounting for only 15% of the global population had 80% of the Covid deaths. Could it be that the rich world was more vulnerable, somehow, because its populations were older, or more individualistic, or had forgotten to be scared of infectious disease? Even then, some were warning that the worst was yet to come, once the disease took hold in poorer countries. World Bank analysts Philip Schellekens and Diego Sourrouille, for example, predicted a “massive shift” in disease burden to the developing world. Just in terms of demography, they said, you’d expect those countries to account for around 70% of deaths. As things stand they account for a little over half of it, which is probably an underestimate due to variations in data quality – and the pandemic is far from over. Last week saw more than 5.8 million new cases of Covid globally, the highest number yet. More than 3 million people have now died from Covid, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which also reports that infections and hospitalisations in those aged 25 to 59 are increasing at an alarming rate. “It took nine months to reach 1 million deaths, four months to reach 2 million, and three months to reach 3 million,” WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said last week.
The sharpest upticks in recent weeks have been seen in south-east Asia – driven in large part by India – and the eastern Mediterranean and western Pacific regions, but the situation is also very bad in Latin America. People who migrated to Brazil in search of work are now reported to be fleeing the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding there. Infection rates are still high in many wealthy countries – including the US and much of Europe – but the mood is more upbeat: as vaccines roll out, many people feel the worst is behind them. Some US states have rashly lifted their mask mandates. The British government gave the most optimistic signal it could think of earlier this month, when it reopened pubs. And Covid-19 is slipping down the headlines, reflecting not just fatigue at having to respect the rules, but fatigue at the very mention of the disease. Fear concentrates the mind, but fear is dissipating; we’d rather read about Tory sleaze, or the doomed European Super League. Again, you could be forgiven for asking, is there one pandemic or two? Only now the question has an entirely different meaning. The tables have turned. In reality, there was only ever one pandemic. We tend to think of it in terms of national impacts and responses, at best regional ones, but for it to make sense you have to stand back and look at it globally. For all its idiosyncrasies, Covid will stay true to type in at least one way: like pandemics throughout history, it will hammer the poorest hardest. Depending on where you’re standing, there are genuine reasons to be cheerful. The vaccines are effective in mitigating the disease and there’s growing evidence that they slow its spread too. But their rollout is extremely uneven. A quarter of Americans have been fully vaccinated to date, compared with fewer than 2% of Ghanaians. An Israeli is 20 times more likely to have received a single vaccine dose than a Palestinian, and there are still countries that haven’t administered any. There’s unevenness within countries too, in part due to vaccine hesitancy. A recent survey of US healthcare workers showed that 48% had yet to be vaccinated, and 18% didn’t intend to be. Partly because they have seen relatively few Covid deaths locally, people in Hong Kong are staying away from vaccine clinics – a manifestation of the so-called “prevention paradox”. The recent increases in cases and deaths are partly due to the spread of new Covid variants. These are all more transmissible than the original form, first detected in China, and some of them are more lethal. There’s good reason to hope that the vaccines will continue to work against them – or can be updated to do so – but in the meantime the variants, combined with slow vaccine rollout, are pushing fragile health systems to breaking point.
Without oxygen, for example, it’s impossible to treat a severely ill Covid patient, but there’s a global shortage of the gas. In Peru, where hospitals are in crisis, Médecins Sans Frontières reports that “people in many cities queue overnight and sleep in the rough to fill up their oxygen tanks from the few working reservoirs, hoping to take care of their relatives at home”. When a health system is paralysed, non-Covid patients are unable to get treated too, and resources are sucked away from longer-term public health campaigns – meaning that the burden of diseases such as HIV and malaria may increase. Demography is not the only reason for the developing world’s continuing vulnerability, in other words. The Covax facility, which was designed to offset vaccine nationalism, aims to get a first vaccine dose to at least 20% of the population of each participating country by the end of 2021 – though it now looks like it will fall short of that goal. Even if it hits its target, since less than a quarter of the global population is judged likely to have acquired immunity through natural infection to date, that will leave at least half of it susceptible to Covid in the short term. The disease still mainly targets older people, and though rich countries tend to have proportionally more older people than poorer ones, in absolute terms there are far more elderly people in the developing world. India, for example, has around three times as many people aged 60 or older as Japan, though in terms of its population structure, Japan is considered the oldest country in the world. Burgeoning infection rates in the developing world therefore herald absolute, if not relative, carnage there. We can still hope that the global death toll from Covid in 2021 will not exceed that of 2020 – as the vaccines do their work – even if it’s far from a given. But we can be confident that poorer countries will contribute most of this year’s Covid deaths. That thought alone should give us pause – and in addition we should remember that rich countries are not immune from what happens beyond their shores. Rampant Covid in countries such as India and Brazil will shape the evolution of the virus and could cause new, even more dangerous variants to emerge, which neither our borders nor our vaccines are guaranteed to keep out. That’s why it’s too early to rest on our laurels and why vaccine equity is so important – because this is a pandemic, meaning it’s global. Laura Spinney is a science journalist and author.

122155,commentisfree/2021/apr/26/vaccine-hoarding-covid-tragedy-india-britain-vaccinated,Opinion,Vaccine hoarding is all the more disturbing as a Covid disaster unfolds in India  | Gaby Hinsliff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/26/vaccine-hoarding-covid-tragedy-india-britain-vaccinated,"The idea that nobody is protected until everyone’s protected has become something of a pandemic cliche lately. Yet that doesn’t make it any less true, clinically or morally. As long as the virus is rife in any country, it could always mutate and spread again. What is only now becoming obvious, however, is that as long as others are experiencing horrors on the scale of India, consciences everywhere will be troubled. The harrowing scenes unfolding nightly on our television screens are what Britain feared but ultimately did not have to suffer: hospitals running out of oxygen, people dying in the street for lack of a bed, families forced to bury the dead in their gardens as crematoriums were overwhelmed. India’s tragedy is a stark reminder of Britain’s own relative good fortune, hard as this year has been for many. But to be lucky is a morally queasy, guilty thing. The success of Britain’s vaccination programme, with half the country having had at least one shot and the NHS hoping to start calling up thirtysomethings soon, remains an amazingly heroic effort. But it does not sit right that India, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of vaccines, should have entered the gates of Covid hell with fewer than 10% of its population jabbed. For the many Britons with family ties to India, these are deeply anxious times. At the weekend, it emerged that a Downing Street aide had tested positive for Covid after travelling to India, prompting alarmist headlines about how he might have spread a new variant through Whitehall. But arguably the more troubling aspect was that he was reportedly sent out to try to get more Indian-manufactured doses of vaccine for Britain, at a time when the Indian government – for reasons now all too distressingly obvious – was seeking to hold back many of the doses it was previously exporting in their millions, many destined for developing countries. The British mission apparently left empty-handed, but one is left wondering uncomfortably if it was even right to try. How can it not ultimately backfire on the richest countries if they’re seen to be snaffling up more than their share of resources yet again? In a sense, this tangled web of global guilt and resentment is nothing new. That some countries have ordered more vaccines than they can use, while others served by the Covax initiative to procure vaccines for developing nations may have to wait until 2024 to reach mass immunisation, is no more or less fair than the way British households throw away an estimated 4.5m tonnes of perfectly edible food every year while millions worldwide go hungry. It’s no more or less fair than the way the richest 10% of the world’s population (that’s anyone earning more than £27,000 in Britain) account for over its half of carbon emissions while the poorest end up on the sharp end of the climate crisis. If Boris Johnson had, once the over-50s were safely jabbed, asked younger British people to wait a few months so doses could be either diverted to countries lagging behind or retained by producer countries in need, he’d probably have faced protests in the streets and on his own backbenches. Look after your own, people would have said: charity begins at home. The more sophisticated version of this would have been that it’s all very sad, but that India’s problems actually flow from its prime minister Narendra Modi’s overconfidence in judging the epidemic more or less over back in March; not our fault. It’s true Modi has much to answer for. But still there is something disturbing about the fact that India is on track for up to half a million cases a day on some projections, while Britons young enough to have practically zero chance of dying from Covid get vaccinated. I was one of them, a week ago, and remain unbelievably grateful for it. But as a healthy fortysomething woman, I am also uncomfortably aware that I probably wasn’t at high risk; that only a geographical accident of birth makes me this lucky. Thankfully foreign governments worldwide are now offering oxygen, ventilators, testing kits and drugs to India in its hour of need. But that doesn’t solve harder questions about the hoarding of vaccines, raw materials and patent rights in the west, or the fact that Covax clearly isn’t working as fast as it should. It doesn’t change the fact that nobody is safe until everyone is safe; that nobody really sleeps easy until everybody does. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",2021-04-26 13:55:29+00:00,122156,2

Results from trials of its malaria vaccine, R21, show it to be 77% effective. If replicated in larger scale trials, it would be a remarkable breakthrough. Malaria kills more than 400,000 people a year, almost all in sub-Saharan Africa, and mainly children. Until now, the only approved anti-malarial vaccine, Mosquirix, has had a low level of efficacy – among young children it reduced cases by 39%; in infants, says the World Health Organization, it “did not work sufficiently well to justify its further use”. This is what makes the new vaccine so exciting, raising the possibility of reducing deaths to the “tens of thousands”. The reason for slow progress in eradicating malaria is partly technical. The parasite that causes the disease, of which there are five kinds, passes through several life stages, making it more difficult to target with a vaccine. Even without vaccines, one can eliminate the disease. A century ago, malaria was endemic in parts of America. In the 1930s, Washington launched an eradication programme, draining mosquito breeding areas and improving health services. By 1950, it had almost disappeared. In 1955, WHO launched a global anti-malaria programme, but excluded sub-Saharan Africa for logistical reasons. It was highly successful in Europe, parts of Asia and the Americas but was suspended in 1969 because of drug and insecticide resistance and funding shortages. As with many diseases of poor countries, the problem lies with a lack of resources and political will. That is why the new vaccine carries with it so much hope. Something to celebrate on World Malaria Day. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",2021-04-25 06:00:09+00:00,122422,2
122549,commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy,Opinion,The world is desperate for more Covid vaccines – patents shouldn’t get in the way | Stephen Buranyi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy,"Biolyse is a small pharmaceutical manufacturer in Canada with a simple proposition: provide a recipe for a coronavirus vaccine, and it will produce 20m doses for nations in the global south. It has approached AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, and even asked the Canadian government to help it with compulsory licensing – which would give it the authorisation to produce another company’s patented product for emergency use – but so far no one has taken up its offer. When I reached him by phone this week, John Fulton, the vice-president of Biolyse, told me: “We’ve been passed over. We’ve got this production capacity and it’s not being put to use. If we had started this last year, we could have shipped millions of doses by now. This is supposed to be like a wartime effort, everyone in it together. But that doesn’t seem to be the case.” The situation seems mind-bogglingly shortsighted. The world desperately needs coronavirus vaccines. About 430m doses have been produced so far this year, enough for about 215 million people. And of the doses already given, about half have gone to the richest 16% of the world’s population. Covax, the World Health Organization initiative to transfer vaccines to nations in need, has delivered just 38m doses. According to analysis by the Center for Global Development and the Economist, nations in the global south may not reach widespread vaccination until 2023. The situation is dire, and we need more vaccines. At the moment, there is no worldwide joined-up effort to expand production. As incredible as it sounds, after all the public money that went into vaccine development, making and distributing them has been left entirely up to the market. Each company has its own – totally secret – recipes and supply chains, and they insist no other approach is possible. But the Biolyse offer does suggest another way. They’re a chemotherapy drug manufacturer, certified to produce advanced biological compounds for injection. “We have the facilities and equipment, bioreactors, we have fill-and-finish capability. Depending on how much help we get with technology transfer, we could be ready in a few months,” explains Biolyse’s head of production Claude Mercure. “I don’t understand pharma’s stance on this. Everyone needs to make money, sure. But this is a very serious situation and there’s no reason to be this harsh,” he added. Fulton says he has been in touch with other manufacturers who say they also have spare capacity – for instance, fellow Canadians Pnuvax and the Bangladeshi producer Incepta. He hopes to put together a consortium to strengthen their offer to industry. Many governments and organisations back the idea of opening up production. India and South Africa have asked the WTO to suspend patent protections to allow other companies to produce existing vaccines and drugs – but they have been blocked by rich nations. Former world leaders and nobel laureates have called for suspending patents and coordinating production across the world – the kind of global effort that eliminated smallpox and polio in the 20th century. But so far their efforts have been unsuccessful. This would mark a shift away from business as usual. The pharmaceutical industry has long relied on a very strict global intellectual property regime to ensure they are the sole suppliers of their most profitable drugs. For them, this is an existential issue that goes beyond the current crisis. The arguments against opening up the rights to make coronavirus vaccines are the same ones the industry has always used: that it would stifle innovation, and that transferring the knowhow to others would be too difficult or simply wouldn’t work. But the coronavirus vaccines were created with huge amounts of public research. And generic drug manufacturers in developing nations have proven time and again that they can make large amounts of high-quality drugs, for a fraction of the price. This system, where a company that holds the patent on a drug can monopolise its production, even in a global emergency, is a recent invention. During the second world war, the US government forced pharmaceutical companies to share recipes for antibiotics. In the worldwide campaign against smallpox, the WHO maintained a register manufacturing techniques and recipes, evaluating them and helping to share the technology globally. We collectively recognised that some things are more important than the legal protection of profit. In fact, prior to the WTO and the proliferation of trade treaties, countries around the world regularly used “compulsory licensing” to make the pharmaceutical industry allow local manufacturers to produce drugs after paying a licence fee. This was so uncontroversial that Canada used to do it for anti-ulcer medications. Patents weren’t always sacrosanct. Biolyse is currently working with the non-profit Knowledge Economy International to exercise a little-used Canadian law allowing for compulsory licensing to let them to proceed. But progress has been slow. It may seem like it’s a bit late in the crisis to try new approaches. But the truth is, for much of the world the pandemic hasn’t even hit its halfway point. The worldwide shortage in vaccines is likely to continue for years. Allowing big pharma to handle business as usual has worked out for just a rich few. There are people willing to work for the kind of worldwide approach we had in the past, we have to support their efforts.

122925,commentisfree/2021/apr/22/lobbying-james-dyson-boris-johnson,Opinion,"A lot of people pitched in during Covid, but only Dyson got a tax waiver for it | Gaby Hinsliff",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/lobbying-james-dyson-boris-johnson,"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. John F Kennedy’s call to public service, in what he termed the “long twilight struggle” against tyranny, poverty and disease, is more than half a century old. But it has felt strangely apt again during the struggle against Covid-19, which has had millions of people wondering what they could usefully do to help while medical staff risked their lives to treat sick people. Teachers racked up untold hours of unpaid overtime. AstraZeneca developed a vaccine to be made available at cost. Owners of small shops and restaurants obediently shuttered them, despite knowing there was a chance that businesses built up over a lifetime wouldn’t survive lockdown. Those who lacked the professional skills to help found other ways of pitching in: shopping for neighbours, sewing scrubs at kitchen tables, volunteering for vaccine trials or donating to food banks. And millions sacrificed their personal freedom if not exactly gladly, then at least in the knowledge they were doing their bit for the greater good. Which brings us to a text exchange between the billionaire inventor Sir James Dyson and the prime minister at the height of the pandemic last spring, in which Dyson explained that before joining a national effort to produce lifesaving ventilators he just needed to check that any staff flying to Britain to get involved in it wouldn’t become liable for tax here. The texts don’t go into detail, but references to day counts suggest Dyson’s concern was for staff who, whether born British or not, aren’t domiciled for tax in Britain and thus cannot spend more than 90 days a year in the country without having to pay British taxes from which they would otherwise be exempt. Ask not merely what you can do for your country, but what it can do about the resulting tax liability. Some may be wondering how a great British company, led by a great British patriot (as he described himself when campaigning passionately for Brexit), could have so many key people unable to spend much time in Britain. That would be because, after Brexit, Dyson moved his headquarters to Singapore, saying he wanted to focus on the Asian markets, where much of its manufacturing was now happening. Patriotism moves in mysterious ways, including sometimes clean out of the country, although interestingly it emerged this week that Dyson had just moved his parent company’s address back to the UK. Anyway, the prime minister messaged back, “I will fix it tomo!”, and two weeks later the Treasury announced a temporary waiver for anyone entering Britain specifically to work on the ventilator project. Strictly speaking, we don’t know if that was down to Dyson. Maybe every tycoon Johnson knows was asking similar questions. As Dyson has rightly said, this measure didn’t directly benefit his company – as distinct from benefiting a handful of its staff – and to his credit the company ultimately ploughed £20m into learning how to produce the ventilators Britain needed, or thought it did. It’s not his fault that, as doctors learned more about treating Covid, Dyson ventilators turned out to be almost as superfluous as the American-style televised briefing room Johnson spent £2.6m kitting out before deciding not to hold any actual televised briefings. It’s not unreasonable either to argue that people shouldn’t lose out personally for doing their bit in a crisis. But that argument would wash better if the government hadn’t spent so long failing to fund a sick pay system generous enough that low earners could afford to do their bit and self-isolate after catching Covid. The trouble is that some people’s bits seem to be regarded as more important than others, even if stubbornly high Covid rates in poor neighbourhoods suggest the self-isolating bit is really very important indeed. What sticks in the craw, just as it did when Dominic Cummings escaped to Barnard Castle, is the suspicion that sacrifice for the greater good is – as the American heiress Leona Helmsley famously said of taxes – mainly for little people, the kind who don’t have ministers on speed dial.
And that’s the trouble with so-called government by WhatsApp; it’s not just that it circumvents Whitehall formalities, but that it smacks of favouritism. It rankles horribly with people running small British manufacturing companies who were pretty sure they could produce ventilators in a national emergency too, but struggled to reach anyone in officialdom capable of explaining how to get involved. It rankles with people who were worried about working in care homes without proper PPE as the virus ripped through them last spring, or people asked to teach 30 potentially infectious kids in a classroom whose windows don’t open properly, but whose union was publicly derided by ministers for seeking reassurances from them. While the tax waiver itself won’t have cost the exchequer that much, it wouldn’t have cost that much in the grand scheme of things to support more of the freelancers excluded from grants for the self-employed either, or to give public-sector workers the bonuses some countries have offered in return for risking everything during the pandemic. To prioritise one and not the other says something revealing about who gets heard, and who doesn’t; whose worries are deemed critical enough to be resolved “tomo”, and who will have to wait. And therein lies a problem infinitely harder to fix. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",2021-04-22 15:05:52+00:00,122926,2

Is the government’s pandemic response now also “running quite hot”, in the memorable phrase attributed to Michael Gove last year? The expression meant that Mr Gove was, relatively speaking, averse to Covid restrictions – that he was among those, in government and outside, who were prepared to countenance a higher level of risk from new cases in return for a reduction in the economic and social risks associated with lockdowns. In the intervening year, the opposition between economic and health impacts that was used to frame the politics of the pandemic, in its initial stages, has been debunked. Since exponentially rising cases lead, inexorably, to the most severe measures, it was delusional as well as dangerous to imagine that the virus could be allowed to circulate. What difference does the successful rollout of the vaccination programme make? This is the question now confronting policymakers, and everyone else with decisions to make about how to live in the current circumstances. At some point we all hope, along with ministers, that a vaccinated population will be able to exist in a much more normal way, with any localised outbreaks of disease quickly controlled. It should not need saying that this point has not been reached. With the daily number of new cases up more than 1,000 on last week, Glasgow in lockdown and high infection rates in parts of England including Leicester, Bolton and Hounslow in west London, the danger of a third wave remains. Some experts believe it is already here. While 58.5% of people in the UK have had a first vaccine dose, second doses have been given to only 37.9%. Up to three-quarters of new Covid cases are thought to be caused by the India variant, which is no longer limited to a handful of hotspots. Correctly, the government has pressed pause on plans to lift the remaining restrictions on 21 June. But it cannot sit on its hands until taking the decision on 14 June. The recent issuing of new guidance including travel restrictions for the worst affected areas in England, without informing them first, was high-handed and ham-fisted. Yasmin Qureshi, Labour MP for Bolton South East and a shadow cabinet member, complained of being gobsmacked”, and rightly so. The messaging around international travel too is increasingly fraught and opaque. Andrew Flintham, the managing director of Tui UK, said “moral confusion” was the consequence of rules saying that people are allowed to visit amber list countries, but shouldn’t. The overwhelming impression remains one of a government led by a man who does not want to risk his personal popularity by spoiling anybody’s fun. Instead, he and his ministers deflect responsibility on to individuals who have only a fraction of the information and expertise at their disposal. This is not wise government. We don’t know yet to what extent rising case numbers will translate into hospitalisations or deaths. We do know that terrible mistakes were made last year, and that the NHS will be unable to clear a vast backlog if there is another crisis. Senior NHS figures including Chris Hopson are calling for a “better quality of evidence-based debate”. Of course, people want to enjoy the summer, but it is Boris Johnson’s job to help them understand the risks. When lives are at stake, clarity and honesty must come before pipe dreams.",2021-05-31 17:30:29+00:00,123102,2
123143,commentisfree/2021/may/31/rich-countries-vaccines-covid-19-manageable-health-issue-pandemic,Opinion,"In rich countries, vaccines are making Covid-19 a manageable health issue | Devi Sridhar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/rich-countries-vaccines-covid-19-manageable-health-issue-pandemic,"When Covid-19 began to spread rapidly in January 2020, governments across the world had limited strategies to deal with it. Without a vaccine or proven treatments for the disease, or even access to mass testing, the only choice political leaders faced was taking the least bad option available. There were four approaches that different governments took during the beginning of the pandemic. China, New Zealand, Vietnam and Thailand chose to eliminate the virus at the cost of stopping international travel. Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea suppressed the virus through rigorous testing, tracing and isolating while avoiding harsh lockdowns. Sweden allowed the virus to spread through the population before realising health systems could not cope with an influx of Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, European countries including England and France controlled the virus through a cycle of lockdown measures while keeping borders largely open. This resembled a holding pattern for a plane running out of fuel: people grew tired of continual restrictions, the economy suffered and Covid-19 was never fully suppressed. Before the arrival of vaccines, the most effective of these strategies was the elimination, or “zero Covid”, approach taken by countries such as New Zealand, Taiwan and China. But the tools we have at our disposal have changed radically in the past 15 months. We now have safe and effective vaccines, treatments and mass testing, which permit governments to rethink their initial strategies and form a more sustainable plan for the future. Covid-19 forced governments around the world into a tailspin because of the substantial number of deaths it caused, the burden it placed on health services and the risks of long-term symptoms in younger people. Without lockdown measures in place, the virus could grow exponentially, finding endless hosts to jump between, while fear of the virus caused people to change their behaviour, resulting in economic damage. Vaccines are now addressing these three problems. If governments are able to vaccinate 80-90% of their population, Covid-19 will increasingly become a manageable health issue, much like other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles or pertussis (whooping cough).
We know that vaccines clearly help to reduce hospitalisations and deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that elderly people vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) were 94% less likely to be hospitalised than people of the same age who were not vaccinated. A study in Scotland found that after the fourth week of an initial dose, the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines reduced risk of hospitalisation by up to 85% and 94% respectively. Early research from Yale University also indicates that vaccines seem to help those with long Covid. As many as 30-40% of those who get the vaccines report improvement to their symptoms. If vaccines do indeed prevent people from dying or getting seriously ill, then the end of the pandemic is in sight for the countries that have high vaccine coverage, testing and treatments. One recent study of healthcare workers in Scotland that has not yet been peer reviewed suggests vaccines may also be able to prevent transmission. Israel has raced ahead in its vaccination programme, with the US and the UK not far behind. The European Union is steaming along, and the next group to join them will probably be in east Asia and the Pacific. Once these populations are protected with vaccine-induced immunity, they can start to open up again to the world and lift their border restrictions in a careful and managed way. In these countries, case numbers will become less relevant, as the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths will be largely broken. This was always the aim of scientists working on treatments and vaccines, and science has succeeded. But there are still two areas of considerable uncertainty. We may yet see the emergence of a variant that reduces the effectiveness of vaccines against death and serious disease. And how we manage the virus in children and adolescents, who will be largely unvaccinated and still susceptible, will be a continuing challenge. It seems inevitable that children under 16 will also be vaccinated (the US has already authorised the Pfizer vaccine to be used in 12-15s). So when will the pandemic be over? Covid-19 won’t end with a bang or a parade. Throughout history, pandemics have ended when the disease ceases to dominate daily life and retreats into the background like other health challenges. Barring a horrific new variant, rich countries such as Britain and the US may be within months, if not weeks, of what their citizens will see as the end of the pandemic. This isn’t the case in poorer countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. For countries that can’t afford vaccines, technology or treatments for Covid-19, populations will remain trapped by outbreaks that cause chaos in hospitals and kill health workers and vulnerable and elderly people. It’s now incumbent on richer countries that are emerging from the pandemic to turn their attention to poorer nations and ensure they have the resources they urgently require. It’s only when Covid-19 stops disrupting lives and livelihoods in all regions that we’ll truly be able to say the pandemic has ended.

I’m confounded why luck had to come into it | Van Badham,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/as-an-australian-im-lucky-that-i-got-my-first-jab-im-confounded-why-luck-had-to-come-into-it,"I got my coronavirus vaccine last week. I celebrated at a favourite burger joint, slurping a milkshake as big as my head and dancing around the table to Daft Punk, even as news broke that an outbreak in my home state of Victoria foreshadowed another lockdown. Even as my needled arm began to gently throb. Missing a childhood measles vaccine almost killed me; it’s now unlikely coronavirus will have that chance. I woke up the next day with a warned-of hazy brain, a little nausea and a strong feeling I may need to gnaw my aching arm from a bear trap. Mostly, however, I felt relieved – as if the one decision I made to try my luck with eligibility, book an appointment and hop to the pop-up clinic at my local Mercure has negated a lifetime of more – ahem – questionable self-care choices.
As an Australian, I’m lucky that I got my jab. I’m also confounded why luck had to come into it. Australia is a prosperous western nation with a cohesive public healthcare system, but the Morrison Liberal government has spectacularly mismanaged the vaccine rollout, blaming supply shortages and relying on a “hermit kingdom” shut-border containment policy. Now the virus is spreading again and a local firewall of vaccinations that may limit spread of this devastating “Indian strain” isn’t built. So the political rhetoric has switched and citizens are now copping the blame for under-vaccination, government MPs deployed to fault us for our own “vaccine hesitancy”. “Vaccine hesitancy” is a term the World Health Organization uses to describe why people don’t get vaccinations when vaccines are available. In Australia, we sometimes hear about it as a potential effect of aggressive anti-vaccination campaigns. The idea is that the problematising of vaccination dissuades other people from participating in it. Vaccine hesitancy, though, is complex and context-specific. Dropping a term with strong anti-vaxx associations into the discourse around Australia’s low coronavirus vaccination rate is a sly bait-and-switch that demonises victims of the vaccination rollout failure in lieu of addressing it.
Yes, pandemic-related distress has certainly seduced increasing numbers of Australians into conspiracist beliefs – like anti-vaxxism – but these beliefs still remain marginal to the majority. Yes, there have been aggressive attempts from hard-right agitators to insist coronavirus is a hoax (it isn’t) and that vaccines are a scam (they aren’t) and something-something-government-overreach-don’t-tread-on-me (whatever). A couple of hundred people marching against lockdowns in Melbourne last week is still only a couple of hundred people in a city of 5 million and numbers are not growing from last year. If you’re still seeing anti-vaxx material online, it’s not because of a mass movement behind it. It might just be the online Russian-influence operations which have been sprung pushing such messages in the past. The reality is that Australians are overwhelmingly predisposed to embracing public health measures without complaint. Dr Aaron Martin from the University of Melbourne describes mainstream Australia more accurately as a “pragmatic” community, not bound to historical rebellious individualism that dogs American attitudes. Monash’s Prof Graeme Davison also argues that Australians habitually and consistently appreciate collective measures for public safety. His evidence? Seatbelts, breathalysers … oh, and our recently demonstrated mass compliance with mask mandates and lockdown directives. There’s further proof: 6,000 Victorians got vaccinated two weeks ago, but in the wake of the new outbreak, 15,000 Victorians were jabbed in a single day. That doesn’t sound like “hesitancy”. It sounds like they may have had the pure good luck that I did to hear Victoria’s acting premier James Merlino announce there’s “no problem” with the state’s vaccine supply.
Alas, within the Morrison government’s relentless vaccination mess lies a staggering confusion of messages, despite a whopping $40m spent on an ad campaign. Significant numbers of vaccine-eligible Australians don’t know they’re eligible or that the vaccines are now in plentiful supply. We do know people who’ve fronted clinics, been deemed ineligible and turned away, though. We know some deemed eligible can’t access the vaccine. We know “prioritised” aged care and disability sectors whose uneven vaccine supplies have alternatively delivered no doses or “abject failure”. Into this information morass stumbled the government’s hopeless PR mishandling of a scare campaign about a six-in-a-million blood clot risk from the AstraZeneca vaccine that overshadowed the coronavirus’s 20,000-in-a-million fatality rate. Is Australia really in the grip of “vaccine hesitancy” or is the national affliction “government vaccine failure, leading to total confusion”? I nurse my aching arm and the hard lump under the skin and consider that getting a coronavirus vaccine shouldn’t be a matter of luck. It should be the most base expectation of government competence, in a pragmatic, collective commitment to protecting Australia.",2021-05-31 01:25:17+00:00,123230,2
123265,commentisfree/2021/may/30/the-guardian-view-on-medical-records-nhs-data-grab-needs-explaining,Opinion,The Guardian view on medical records: NHS data grab needs explaining | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/30/the-guardian-view-on-medical-records-nhs-data-grab-needs-explaining,"The government wants to extract the general practice history of every patient in England by 1 July. Haven’t you heard? Ministers are not exactly shouting about this momentous news. NHS Digital, the body proposing the new scheme, has described it as a way to “improve” the collection of patient information that would allow better planning of healthcare services and use of data in medical research. But there are charging guidelines for the use of this data. One might reasonably conclude that the most sensitive medical details of the entire adult English population are being collected and some portion may be provided at “costs” agreed with third parties. The records being stored contain the most private details of a person’s life. The proposals suggest mass collection of every English patient’s history, including mental health episodes, their smoking and drinking habits, and diagnoses of diseases such as cancer. But it will also include dated instances of domestic violence, abortions, sexual histories and criminal offences. Given the proposed scope of such a database, it is reasonable to ask who will be given this data, and for what purpose. While medical bodies have been consulted, they have hardly given the plans a ringing endorsement. GPs may be reluctant, as they will be accountable for the data transfer. The audit trails of much less detailed hospital data which has been transferred to the private sector hardly inspires confidence in this government’s willingness to hold to account institutions that ignore safeguards. Campaigners point to shocking failures to enforce patient privacy, with little comeback for transgressors. England’s 55 million patients have until 23 June to opt out of the scheme, but without a debate about the pros and cons, the public will have good reason to be wary. A perceived lack of transparency risks losing the trust of the public at a time when the health service needs to preserve it. That is why this process needs to be scrapped and restarted. This scheme is not to do with the pandemic. “Control of patient information” notices currently allow for access, and data-wrangling rights, to health records in connection with fighting Covid-19. Allowing access to NHS data has led to some groundbreaking research, notably helping to identify dexamethasone as an effective Covid therapy. However, this experience was born of acute need. The return of normal life is not an excuse to suspend the safeguards that protect patient privacy or allow third parties access to GP records, which cannot be rendered anonymous even by scrubbing some personal information. This is the biggest data grab in the history of the health service. NHS Digital says that “we do not allow data to be used solely for commercial purposes”. That is hardly reassuring. If the data was just partly used for commercial purposes presumably that is fine with Matt Hancock, the health secretary. The public is likely to take a dim view of a government that allowed informatics firms to pay for patients’ records, then sell “market access” and “market insights” for a substantial profit to a host of unreported drug, data and tech companies. There is no doubt about the power of AI to extract value by linking and reusing health data. It should ring alarm bells that ministers propose extracting sensitive personal medical records without clear purpose and with no meaningful information governance measures to keep pace with these developments.",2021-05-30 17:25:00+00:00,123266,16
123549,commentisfree/2021/may/29/lab-leak-theory-covid-natural-manmade-sars-cov-2,Opinion,Why the ‘lab-leak’ theory of Covid’s origins has gained prominence again | Stephen Buranyi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/lab-leak-theory-covid-natural-manmade-sars-cov-2,"Joe Biden wants to know if the coronavirus pandemic originated in a laboratory. On Thursday, the president ordered US intelligence agencies to “redouble” their efforts to find exactly when and how the virus jumped into humans, and the two scenarios he suggested were an infected animal, or a laboratory accident. Just last year, that second utterance would have got a person dismissed as a kook and a conspiracist; but an increasing number of mainstream figures, from those in the press to influential scientists and government officials such as US chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, are at least open to the idea that the pandemic may have started with a containment failure in China, or a souped-up virus experiment gone wrong. If you’re just tuning in, bleary-eyed and wondering how yet another thing you were told couldn’t possibly happen appears to be on the verge of becoming reality, you’re not alone. But there is a straightforward way to see what the possibilities are, what scientists currently think, and what information might resolve the dispute once and for all. First, in the early days of the pandemic, nearly every scientist and media figure with any sort of platform assured the world that the pandemic had a natural origin. A coronavirus that naturally infected bats gained the ability to infect humans through normal evolution in the wild or farmed captivity. This had historical precedent: both the original Sars virus in 2003 and the Mers outbreak in 2012 arose in this way. And the viral genome, shared by Chinese scientists early in the pandemic, and since sequenced around the world thousands of times, didn’t show any obvious signs of manipulation: it didn’t use any well-known viruses as a basic framework, or have the genetic equivalent of bore-holes and cut-marks. All of these are decent arguments, but not overwhelming. A matter of low attention bandwidth at the height of the first wave, an overall deference to authority, and a general wariness about conspiratorial-sounding theories, led the animal-leap case to be presented and repeated with airtight surety. And this left it open to attack. Something that should have been widely acknowledged back then is that scientists often do research with viruses that includes manipulating them to become more effective, or to infect other species – even humans. The justification for this is to learn about viral behaviour, and track how a pandemic threat might evolve. This is called “gain-of-function” research, and lots of people think it’s a bad idea. What is also known for sure, is that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), nearby to the first recorded outbreaks, is the world’s premier collector of wild bat coronaviruses, has grown them in their in-house laboratories before, and had the expertise to conduct gain-of-function experiments. If you wanted to create a pandemic coronavirus in a lab, the WIV would be a hell of a place to do it. And so there are now several theories about the pandemic strain coming out of the WIV, ranging from one of their on-file natural coronaviruses infecting a lab member; an ill-advised gain-of-function strain doing the same; or a purposely human-targeted bioweapon strain being accidentally or intentionally unleashed. Given the lab’s capabilities, that’s the full range of careless, reckless, or purely evil possibilities. This means that some version of a lab-leak was always circumstantially and scientifically plausible. Each theory also neatly appeals to a certain sort of person, what you might call the fringes of both sides. If you’re the radically credulous mainstream sort, the natural origin story fits the bill. A naturally emerging viral pandemic is a complex process that the experts say is likely to happen. It’s the way things have happened before. People in positions of authority – say, running a biohazardous lab – are highly competent and probably trustworthy. Mystery solved by association. If you thrive on contingency and conspiracy, however, the lab-leak theory is catnip. A single, discrete event, perpetrated by individuals, and then – if true – surely covered up. Whether you think it was an accident or a doomsday device, access to the lab offers the possibility of a smoking gun, if only you could investigate. Given what we know, both sides are at a deadlock. The WIV had what armchair detectives would call motive, method and opportunity, but there’s no proof that Sars-CoV-2 was ever in the lab. On the circumstantial side, the hole is as deep as you want to go – people have dug into irregularities in the institute’s virus catalogue, there is an “anonymous intelligence report” about WIV members becoming sick with a pneumonia-like illness in November 2019. Do your own research, as they say. But parsing cold war-style intrigue from a desk chair a world away rarely makes anything clearer. When it comes to the science, there isn’t a knockout blow either way. Viruses have multiple evolutionary avenues in front of them, from simple mutations to swapping entire genetic regions with closely related pathogens. Some of these can be worked around or reconstituted in a lab with little trace. Given that the major changes Sars-CoV-2 acquired to become pandemic-ready don’t mirror those in any closely related coronavirus, its emergence was either a rare event – or we simply don’t know very much about wild coronaviruses. The first is possible and the second is surely true. At the same time, if it was created in a lab, the creators took a circuitous route, not using known strains or structures, and not always optimising the virus in obvious ways. Reflecting this, scientific arguments are deep in the weeds at the moment, arguing over the likelihood of one RNA sequence or another arising by natural or artificial means. So far they have served only to keep the window open on both sides. So where did the virus that actually started the pandemic come from? For the natural-emergence side, finding a coronavirus in a bat or intermediate animal that is more genetically similar to Sars-Cov-2 than those currently on record would demonstrate a clear, plausible evolutionary path. The closer the better, and bonus points if it had a physical path to the outbreak as well. This would never amount to an airtight case – meaning some version of lab-leak will always be with us as a fringe theory – but it would placate the majority of scientists. Efforts are ongoing, but could take years. For the lab-leak side, it’s all about the source. Getting access to the WIV strain archive, the lab notebooks, regulatory filings, access to researchers. Again, if these turned out to be squeaky-clean there would always be a fringe alleging a cover-up. But if it is a case of research-gone-wrong, there would probably be evidence in the institute. The greater problem, though, is that access to the WIV isn’t likely to happen any time soon. Scientists, the US government, and the WHO have asked for openness and cooperation from the Chinese state, and have been predictably stonewalled. And so, like many other times over the past year, we’re stuck without a clear answer. The point has been made that, epidemiologically, none of this really matters. Lab or not, the pandemic happened and is still going. But finding its origin would be hugely consequential. A natural origin would absolve any one person, but further confirm that our nature-encircling world is incubating pandemic disease at an unprecedented rate. A lab-leak would tarnish the job of scientific research for a lifetime and prove some of the worst people in the culture war – partially – right. I think I’d prefer the first case, but even more than that, I’d like to know the truth. Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment",2021-05-29 06:00:18+00:00,123550,2
123912,commentisfree/2021/may/27/tories-britain-covid-dominic-cummings-pandemic-labour-media,Opinion,Where were the critics who could have stopped Johnson leading us to Covid tragedy? | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/tories-britain-covid-dominic-cummings-pandemic-labour-media,"Ten days before England locked down too late to prevent tens of thousands of deaths, a senior government official waltzed into No 10 to prophetically declare: “I think we are absolutely fucked. I think this country is heading for a disaster, I think we’re going to kill thousands of people.” In a functioning democracy, you might expect senior journalists briefed by No 10 to have at least questioned what was glaringly obvious to those at the very top – that Britain was disastrously ill-equipped and ill-prepared for a pandemic already sweeping the country.
This did not happen. Instead, government mantras that reflected both Boris Johnson’s denial of the gravity of the crisis and the official lack of preparation were parroted and amplified by senior journalists, and critics were ridiculed. Even as tens of thousands died – “who didn’t need to die”, as Johnson’s former top adviser Dominic Cummings correctly told MPs – as a consequence of the Conservatives’ catastrophic strategy, the official opposition stuck studiously to supporting the government for fear of alienating swing voters. Covid-19 proved a tragic case study in what happens when a national emergency collides with a dysfunctional democracy. As Johnson apparently dismissed Covid as a new swine flu and repeatedly suggested the chief medical officer inject him with it on national television to prove it was nothing to worry about, the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, took to Twitter to share a video produced by an obscure podiatrist named “footman447”, in which he explained the logic for herd immunity using buckets of water. On social media, Labour’s demands that the government publish its scientific advice were ridiculed by commentators as “hipster analysis”. Critics were denounced for “politicising” Covid. “Firmly and calmly,” gushed one Telegraph editor who later became a government speechwriter, “the UK is leading Europe in the fight against the coronavirus.” This was “Boris Johnson’s Churchill moment”, cooed the Financial Times. Meanwhile, foreign newspapers stared aghast at a country that appeared to be merrily skipping towards a cliff edge. Nineteen days before lockdown, the New York Times made astute observations about Britain’s looming calamity that were lacking in most of the domestic press, noting a lack of ventilators, “already overflowing” intensive care beds, some health workers buying their own PPE and an austerity-drained NHS. If such questions had been the focus of UK coverage – rather than breathlessly regurgitated No 10 spin in support of the government’s lethal policy of herd immunity – thousands could have been rescued from premature graves. There have been glaring exceptions – take the Sunday Times’ investigative journalists filleting the Johnson administration’s response, or the BBC’s Lewis Goodall exposing the care home scandal – but Westminster-based lobby journalists all too often saw their role as passing on anonymous briefings from No 10 to suggest there was a method in the government’s madness (as Cummings makes clear, there wasn’t). Much of Cummings’ testimony already exists in the public domain. He has merely placed it in the context of a Tory psychodrama, allowing him to execute drive-by shootings against favoured targets – not least Matt Hancock – while ludicrously defending Rishi Sunak, who invited lockdown sceptics to Downing Street last September in a successful mission to avert a second national lockdown. For those who treat politics as a soap opera with a less attractive cast, this may quicken the pulse, but it leaves Labour with rather searching questions. Keir Starmer’s team decided to simply defer to focus groups urging the opposition not to “play politics” with a national emergency. This was quite unlike the Tories’ approach during the financial crash, for example, when they blamed the crisis on Labour’s overspending with such skilful repetition that focus groups soon repeated back these lines verbatim. We already knew herd immunity was official policy; that vulnerable patients were discharged to care homes without a test, allowing the virus to let rip; that lockdown was imposed too late; that handing test and trace to private contractors spelled disaster. England’s pandemic strategy was led by a man who regretted the first lockdown on the grounds that it damaged the economy and thought Covid was a scare story that only killed 80-year-olds (false, in any case). Yet the Labour leadership declared it would work “constructively” with the government and not be “opposition for opposition’s sake”, even praising aspects of the official response as “an amazing piece of work” a month into lockdown. When one rightwing commentator declared that Starmer’s “definition of opposition is to work out where the Tories are going – and get there first”, he was essentially correct, allowing government attack lines on “Captain Hindsight” to cut through. In January, Labour even took the astonishing position of opposing the shut-down of schools in a new lockdown, only U-turning when it learned the government was imminently going to order it. As a result, much of the public has concluded that the government was handed a bad set of cards – that sure, they made mistakes, but who wouldn’t in their shoes? – and that Labour would have done little different anyway. Yet Cummings’ testimony underlines a basic truth that would represent Britain’s biggest scandal since appeasement if democracy was working as it should be. Because of Johnson’s incompetence, inhumanity, laziness and hubris, and the entirely avoidable, disastrous decisions made by his team, tens of thousands of people suffered premature and avoidable deaths, without even the comfort of their loved ones to hold their hands in their final moments. Rather than intensely scrutinising government decisions, many senior political journalists attempted to concoct a rationale for them where none existed. Even as thousands were suffocating in hospitals beds because of disastrous official failings, the opposition threw the government a lifeline by emphasising just how restrained it intended to be. If you are wondering why our governing party has a sustained and apparently unassailable polling lead even after presiding over a death toll more than three times higher than the Luftwaffe achieved in the Blitz, that is why. “Hopefully this is a case study of how to not to handle something like this,” says Cummings; it is also a case study in what happens when national institutions fail in their most basic function of holding the government to account. A healthy democracy is a question of life and death. What a lesson to have to learn at such an unbearable cost. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",2021-05-27 12:00:26+00:00,123913,67
123977,commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster,Opinion,The government's Covid strategy was discredited but we're still paying the price | Deepti Gurdasani,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster,"Amid the select committee revelations from Dominic Cummings, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the government was following a “herd immunity” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising. It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the prime minister and by many scientific advisers to the government – including Patrick Vallance, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity. The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied. There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy. Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage. It is widely known that the government made a U-turn when an Imperial College model showed the strategy would lead to 400,000 deaths. The late March lockdown swiftly followed. But this realisation did not require any sophisticated calculation and many experts had been raising the alarm for weeks. We knew even by March last year that locking down earlier would have saved tens of thousands of lives. What is even more concerning, and has not been discussed as much, is how little the government seems to have learned from those difficult early months of the coronavirus crisis. Even after the consequences of the herd immunity strategy became clear, the idea still casts a shadow over our pandemic response.
These flawed ideas even reappeared last September when the government’s Sage committee advised another lockdown with cases rising rapidly. The government chose to ignore this advice, instead meeting scientists who were proponents of the “naturally acquired herd immunity” strategy. Lockdown was delayed again, and once again it cost tens of thousands of lives. As recently as January this year, we heard Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at Public Health England speak about allowing the disease to circulate in younger people “where it’s not causing much harm” while protecting “the people who are really vulnerable”. Even now the government and its advisers still speak about “living with the virus” and “acceptable deaths”, despite strong evidence that this means thousands of more people getting infected and all that entails. Living with the virus also increases the risk of new variants arising, even as rollout of vaccines continues. Despite what some continue to claim, there has only ever been one real option: when faced with a novel respiratory virus, with a relatively high fatality rate and unknown long-term impacts, you have to eliminate it. Countries who got this right did so early. The differences between those countries that adopted an elimination approach and ones with mitigation strategies have become ever more stark over time, both for public health outcomes and the economy. And yet the government continues with a policy of halfway measures aimed at keeping infection levels just low enough so that hospitalisations are below NHS capacity. This has spawned and imported new variants of the virus and has led to at least 150,000 deaths, more than one million people living with long Covid, an over-run health service and a devastated economy. We have normalised illness, suffering and death. Now we have put all our eggs in the vaccine basket while taking no action to protect these vaccines by preventing virus adaptation or the import of new variants. As continued government negligence herds us towards a third wave of the pandemic, the big question isn’t what mistakes the government made in March, many of which are well-documented, but why it never learned from those errors and continues on a path that risks people’s lives and livelihoods.

124067,commentisfree/2021/may/26/public-health-experts-warned-covid-disaster-dominic-cummings-herd-immunity-deaths,Opinion,Public health experts warned of Covid disaster. Cummings confirms we were right | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/26/public-health-experts-warned-covid-disaster-dominic-cummings-herd-immunity-deaths,"On 12 March last year, Boris Johnson announced that attempts to contain Covid-19 would be halted and the country would have to accept the spread of the virus. As a global public health expert, this policy decision was baffling to me. The experience of China, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong had already shown us that Covid-19 could be contained through testing, tracing and isolation, border restrictions, social distancing and face coverings. By following this east Asian playbook, England could save lives and avoid harsh, extended lockdowns.
I spent that evening reflecting on the decision. Although I wasn’t an expert in British public health policies (my work focuses on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries), it was clear to me that the government was getting this wrong. While other countries had demonstrated that speed was crucial, England’s plan revolved around herd immunity. According to this, the majority of the population would catch the virus. Pursuing herd immunity without a vaccine had never been used for any infectious disease in the past. The consequences of this strategy would be devastating. Dominic Cummings’ testimony has confirmed how government decisions resulted in one of the highest death rates in the richer world and prolonged economic restrictions. In many ways, the testimony merely affirms what many public health experts suspected at the beginning of the pandemic. In those early days, many of us wanted to understand what the government’s assertion that it was “following the science” really meant. But there was no transparency. We couldn’t tell who was a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), nor exactly what the government was planning to do. Instead, we had to piece together a picture of what was happening in No 10 and within Sage from conversations with colleagues and journalists. Cummings’ testimony has exposed how a vacuum of political leadership shaped England’s pandemic response. Relatively less wealthy countries such as Senegal, Greece and South Korea did astonishingly well at managing infections because of their leadership. In contrast, Cummings noted: “It’s completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just as the same as it’s crackers that Boris Johnson was in there.” The careful, considered leadership of the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who set up a Scottish Covid-19 advisory group in early April 2020, which operated transparently and published minutes, contrasts starkly with Johnson’s aversion to detail and hard work. The most frustrating – and darkly predictable – aspect of Cummings’ testimony was his assertion that herd immunity was indeed England’s strategy from February into March, a combination of what the prime minister saw as the simplest solution, as well as the early advice from Sage that this was the only option on the table. Johnson was more concerned with the effects of Covid-19 on the economy and not overreacting, while a careful reading of Sage minutes shows that the group saw the infection as uncontrollable. The reliance on complex theoretical modelling over the principles of basic infectious disease prevention was a problem; so was groupthink within Sage itself. It was only when the NHS reached a similar situation to what we’re now seeing in India and Brazil that the government quickly did a U-turn and enforced a harsh lockdown. But there was no plan for what should be done during this lockdown to get ahead of the virus. While other countries used lockdowns to identify cases and build testing capacity, the government instead used this to relieve pressure on the NHS. This was a major mistake: a waste of expensive time that could have been spent on suppressing and eliminating Covid-19 and preventing future lockdowns. In addition, absolutely no border measures were put in place during the first lockdown, which allowed a continual stream of infections to enter the country, even while people remained in their homes. These early decisions revolved around a tradeoff between saving lives and protecting the economy. This was always a false dichotomy. There was never the option of putting largely vulnerable and elderly people into a plane and watching it crash as the rest of society went on living normally. Allowing Covid-19 to continue circulating among the population would have led the NHS to collapse. Fear of catching a deadly virus would have forced people to change their behaviours and remain at home – thus harming the economy, too. Ministers and their advisers should have instead focused on how they could suppress the virus and buy time to find scientific solutions such as a vaccine. Other countries did this through a combination of firm border measures, a strong system of testing, tracing and isolating, and behavioural changes among populations that were properly informed about the risks of airborne and asymptomatic infections. Yet the government and its advisers refused to look to other countries. There was a lack of humility and an unwillingness to observe or listen to other parts of the world. Some might say that hindsight is always beneficial. But there was no need for hindsight to see how this would play out. The government already had plenty of lessons it could have learned at the time from other countries that were battling with the virus. In fact, the lockdown restrictions in western countries have been much harsher and longer than those in much of east Asia. Meanwhile, a recent Lancet study showed that countries that eliminated Covid-19 not only saved lives, but enjoyed more personal freedoms, civil liberties and economic stability. It is painful to relive the horrifying weeks of March 2020 but it’s essential that we now have a proper public inquiry into England’s handling of Covid-19. The families who lost loved ones deserve accountability from our public officials, who must be held to higher standards of performance and decision-making. And we need to learn from these missteps so we can do better in the future. Make no mistake: there will be other pandemics. England must now learn, much like countries that were affected by Mers, Ebola and Sars, to ensure these mistakes are never repeated. And the public must ask itself: what do we expect from our leaders and ministers? Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2021-05-26 16:52:57+00:00,124068,2
124184,commentisfree/2021/may/26/australias-covid-complacency-should-now-be-shattered,Opinion,Winter is here and Covid is back – Melburnians have heard this script before | Calla Wahlquist ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/26/australias-covid-complacency-should-now-be-shattered,"Winter is here and Covid is back. Six new cases in Melbourne on Wednesday, 15 so far this week. You could be forgiven for thinking we had fallen into a timeslip and been spat out somewhere around June 2020. We have growing case numbers in the northern suburbs, an exposure site at the MCG and one of Melbourne’s biggest shopping centres, and people spreading the virus to their coworkers. The acting premier on television, telling a press conference of shouting reporters that “the next 24 hours are critical” to determine if further restrictions are necessary.
Melburnians have heard this script before. We should be furious about hearing it again. We now know what it is like when the outbreak gets out of control: 112 days of lockdown and almost 800 lives lost in Melbourne alone last year. And we now have access to vaccines – available for free, with no appointment, to anyone over the age of 50, with a relevant medical condition, or who works in a high-risk industry. It is infuriating that it was only on Wednesday, with the threat of further restrictions looming, that long queues began to form at Melbourne’s mass vaccination hubs. We pinned all our hopes on getting at least one vaccine that was safe and effective and, in a miracle of science, we got several. Imagine going back to the version of you still living in the depths of Melbourne’s hard lockdown and telling them that the problem with the vaccine rollout would be that there was too much choice. Enough that people wanted to hold out for a specific vaccine, when another was available. That the problem with ensuring a strong public health response to Covid-19 was not that the health systems were overwhelmed, but that we had become complacent. Part of that makes sense. You can’t maintain a sense of hypervigilance for 14 months. It is exhausting, for one. It’s also, well, boring. The pandemic is boring. News about the pandemic is boring. We all switch off when the case numbers are low then come roaring back whenever there’s an outbreak. But it is more than just Covid fatigue. There was a pervasive sense, before this week, that things were back to normal. The urgency had fallen out of both public and government responses to the pandemic. The security of feeling that life has returned to normal is a privilege that not everybody shares. Some 40,000 Australians have at some point during the pandemic been trapped overseas, and many have not yet been able to return. Thousands more, living in Australia, are wondering when they will ever see their families again. The events industry hasn’t recovered. Cafes in Melbourne’s CBD are permanently shuttered. The tourism sector is still struggling.
People living in disability residential care homes are still not able to receive family visits – and until the woeful rollout of vaccinations in residential care homes was exposed at the disability royal commission last week, just 999 people out of 26,000 had received their first shot. After this figure was publicly condemned, the number of people in residential care to receive their first shot has risen to 5,855. The slow rollout of the vaccine among highly vulnerable cohorts is inexcusable. More understandable is the slow uptake of vaccines in the general public. Some people, who for medical reasons have been recommended to take the Pfizer shot, have been trying for weeks, particularly in regional areas, to get access to a vaccine but have been unsuccessful. I even understand, although I do not agree with, hesitation among those who have access to a vaccine but harbour concerns around the safety of AstraZeneca. When the federal government calls a late-night press conference to warn of an infinitesimally small risk of blood clots among people who take the AstraZeneca vaccine, it is going to cause some vaccine hesitancy. And when they repeatedly say there is no need to rush the rollout in Australia as an excuse for continually pushing back their own vaccine targets, it is going to create complacency. That sense of complacency, at least in Melbourne, should now be shattered.",2021-05-26 07:03:18+00:00,124185,2
124268,commentisfree/2021/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-rules-for-covid-hotspots-another-fine-mess,Opinion,The Guardian view on ‘rules’ for Covid hotspots: another fine mess,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-rules-for-covid-hotspots-another-fine-mess,"During the first phase of the Covid pandemic, councils were driven to despair by the government’s failure to consult with them adequately or utilise local public health expertise. Last May, for example, as infection rates spiralled in the north-east, numerous northern councils defied Whitehall’s decree that all primary school reception classes should reopen. A dysfunctional relationship between Whitehall and local government undermined the national response to the crisis. One year on, as concerns continue to grow over the B.1.617.2 variant of the virus, first detected in India, it is astonishing to see the same mistake being made all over again. On Monday night it emerged that new government guidance was issued last week for eight areas affected by the new variant, where surge testing and vaccinations have been taking place. The fresh advice, which would have major implications for millions of people, recommended that all non-essential travel in and out of the places concerned should be avoided, and people should meet outside rather than inside. But this major policy shift, which appeared to amount to a form of light local lockdown, was not communicated to local public health directors, council leaders or businesses. It simply appeared, unannounced, on the government’s Covid guidance website. The public health director of North Tyneside had spent the early part of this week reassuring regional media that it was “certainly OK” to visit the area. In Leicester, also on the list, 8,000 people attended a Premier League football match on Saturday. Yasmin Qureshi, the MP for Bolton South East, found out about the guidance from a local journalist. There is no excuse for public messaging so incompetent that it fails even to reach local MPs and council officials, and then slowly but surely unravels. In the House of Commons on Tuesday, as confusion reigned, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, accused the government of introducing “lockdowns by stealth”. By late afternoon, after officials from local authorities met government representatives, the directors of public health from all eight areas issued a joint statement, saying that there were “no restrictions on travel” and “no local lockdowns”. Given that the new guidelines, which are now being modified, had never been statutory, their sole effect appears to have been to infuriate local leaders and bemuse the 2 million residents of the eight areas. Families planning to see relatives at half-term are being left to make their own judgments. As with the “amber-listed” holiday destinations, the government appears content to hand responsibility, should anything go wrong, to those who fail to “exercise their judgment” wisely. Confused messages and farcical muddle on this scale erode trust and endanger compliance. Overall, Covid infection levels remain low and the country remains on track for all lockdown restrictions to be lifted on 21 June. But the early signs are that vaccine efficacy after one dose is relatively low against the B.1.617.2 variant, and its transmissibility is relatively high. Until full vaccination is achieved, there will be a significant corridor of uncertainty. Clear communication and proper consultation with local authorities will be needed to navigate it. Why does that seem so difficult for the government to grasp?",2021-05-25 17:56:48+00:00,124269,2
124694,commentisfree/2021/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-community-leisure-centres-not-a-luxury,Opinion,The Guardian view on community leisure centres: not a luxury | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-community-leisure-centres-not-a-luxury,"One of the many discoveries of the last 14 months has been how Covid-19 seeks out underlying vulnerabilities. These are as plural and complex as the people they afflict. But one vulnerability the government has, rightly, pinpointed as something to be addressed is obesity. In 2019, the year leading into the pandemic, figures for England showed over a million hospital admissions for causes directly related to obesity, with 67% of men and 60% of women overweight or obese. Months of lockdown are not likely to have improved this. Boris Johnson, recognising that his weight may have contributed to his hospitalisation with Covid-19, has been banging the drum on the need to achieve a healthy weight; and the government is promoting “weight management services”. It is a pity, then, that the means so far made available to local communities do not support the laudable end. Earlier this month, the former Paralympian Lady Grey-Thompson told Mr Johnson that more than 50% of public leisure facilities are at risk of closing in the next six months. The next day, the District Councils’ Network (DCN), which represents 180 district councils providing leisure services in England, noted that one in three councils expected to close leisure centres for good in the next three months, and over half in the next year. Of those able to remain open, 80% expected to decrease services. The government will point to its recent grant of £100m for leisure centres and a £18,000 restart sum for individual gyms – but the DCN survey was conducted after the awarding of this grant. A funding gap of £325m remains. Commercial gyms certainly have an important role to play in keeping England active. A major beneficial side-effect, of course, is that such activity can also help with mental health: studies have shown even 10 minutes of regular exercise may mitigate depression. But community leisure centres provide this and far more. Corporate outfits, for instance, in view of how expensive swimming pools are to maintain, tend not to provide them. Leisure centres often contain creches, parents’ clubs, and act as affordable venues for family celebrations; they provide school swimming lessons and host all manner of local clubs. The DCN survey also found that 79% had been used in social prescription programmes, while 65% said they had run schemes intended to tackle the epidemic of loneliness. Others run activities for disabled people, dementia initiatives, and rehab of all kinds. At a time when up to two-thirds of youth organisations with incomes under £250,000 are warning they may have to close, leisure centres are somewhere to go that is not the streets. They are on the whole more affordable than gyms and often provide concessions and subsidies. Research by the King’s Fund discovered that for every £1 invested in a leisure centre, £23 in value is created. Community leisure centres are, like libraries or indeed the NHS, a measure of our commitment to all aspects of England’s health and resilience, and to the narrowing of inequalities. They must not be allowed to close.",2021-05-23 17:25:35+00:00,124695,2

The fun of the game is when errors pop up along the way – and the final listener announces with glee something quite different from the original message. As Covid-19 spreads through a population, it undergoes similar changes, or “mutations”. Every time a new virus is built, errors are made when its genome is copied, just like with the whispered message. This has led to Covid-19 variants popping up all over the globe: in the UK, Brazil, the US and now India. Detecting these variants and monitoring their spread is crucial to protect people from being put at risk, and helps inform public health decisions. Which is why we so enthusiastically welcome the news of the Global Pandemic Radar, a pathogen surveillance network that will track developments in the Covid-19 virus. It will also ensure a global infrastructure is in place to better help humanity understand and protect itself from future pathogens. Molecular epidemiology is a cutting-edge area of research in which scientists examine the genomes of viruses to understand their patterns of spread. The overwhelming majority of mutations have no effect on how the virus behaves, but the trail of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they are transmitted are signatures that allow us to retrace the virus’s steps. One signature might say “I am part of a local outbreak” while another could indicate an import from a specific region or country. We can’t tell who infected whom from virus genomes, but we can get a peek into where a virus has been and how it is moving through the population. We can answer questions such as: “When did this variant emerge?”, “How fast is it spreading?” and “Are current restrictions sufficient?”
Some mutations endow the new virus with a specific advantage, making it more transmissible, or allow it to hide from the immune system. We name mutations such as this “variants of concern”. The results from molecular epidemiology can be used to deploy public health resources effectively, for example by blocking variants of concern before they cause large outbreaks – and tweaking vaccines to better protect us. The scale of genetic sequencing during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the efforts to share those data, are unprecedented. Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has rapidly become the most sequenced pathogen in all of history – a position previously held by HIV. More than 1.5 million Covid-19 patients globally have had their virus sequenced and the data shared publicly through Gisaid, a database launched in 2008 following the first global outbreak of bird flu to log variants of influenza. In the same way as the second world war spurred on the development of technologies such as radar, the pandemic has led to astounding advances in how scientists generate, share and analyse virus data. In the UK, sequencing efforts are coordinated at the national level through the Covid-19 Genomics UK (Cog-UK) consortium. Cog-UK was conceptualised in March 2020, when fewer than 100 Covid-19 cases had been diagnosed in the UK. Because molecular epidemiology played such an important part in mapping the spread of Ebola in west Africa in 2013-2016, and it was clear to scientists that genomic surveillance viruses should be a keystone of the UK Covid-19 response. At least 10% of Covid-19 positive samples are collected by Cog-UK from testing sites, hospitals and care facilities. Sequencing is then conducted in hubs across the UK. This systematic approach can reveal the genetic makeup of viruses circulating around the country. When UK cases surged in November 2020, despite lockdown restrictions, we rapidly pinned down the highly transmissible Kent variant (B.1.1.7) as the cause. Some countries, such as the US and India, also initiated national Covid-19 genomic surveillance programmes. The Indian variant (B.1.617) was first identified through the Indian genomic surveillance system, Insacog, in October 2020. B.1.617 has mutations that increase transmissibility, and that may help it evade the immune system. Because of this, the WHO classified it as a variant of concern on 10 May. But it remains difficult to calculate its relative transmissibility and contribution to the current onslaught of infections in India, because sequencing has been patchy. In most countries, sequencing efforts are even less systematic, and led mainly by labs that happened to be set up for pathogen sequencing prior to the pandemic. Academic institutions and hospitals are independently sequencing samples from their local areas, usually obtained from hospitals. In many lower- and middle-income countries, the only sequencing facility is in the capital and this means that only individuals living in the capital, or travelling there for treatment, ever get their virus sequenced. The UK has sequenced 50 out of every 1,000 diagnosed cases, compared with fewer than 1 in 1,000 in India. Eighty countries have submitted fewer than 100 sequences, which is insufficient for tracking variants. While recent advances in the field are nothing short of a triumph, sampling and sequencing efforts remain a global patchwork. Uneven sampling can bias the results of molecular epidemiology, making it impossible to identify the geographic origin of a new variant and difficult to assess its transmissibility. Coordination of Covid-19 sequencing internationally by WHO was already underway, before the announcement regarding the Global Pandemic Radar. But laboratories must be equipped in key locations and staff trained so that procedures are consistent. However, global genomic surveillance for Covid-19 presents unique and daunting challenges. Not least that the sequencing will have to be both global and in real-time – unlike that which goes on for HIV and influenza. And sampling strategies may have to be adapted to address issues about which we are not yet even aware. And what of “Nun’s office Tivoli safe”? “None of us is safe until everyone is safe”– one of the tag lines for the Covid-19 pandemic. The UK’s incredible sequencing efforts will be rendered pointless if global genomic surveillance remains so uneven. In contrast to the second world war, we are now united against a common enemy, and true cooperation is our greatest weapon against the virus.

125346,commentisfree/2021/jun/29/covid-jab-england-care-home-staff-vaccinations,Opinion,Forcing Covid jabs on England’s exhausted care home staff won’t work  | Caroline Abrahams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/29/covid-jab-england-care-home-staff-vaccinations,"When the government announced it was going ahead with the mandatory vaccination of staff in older people’s care homes in England, it wasn’t a surprise. At least 40,000 care home residents have died of Covid-19 so far in England and Wales, along with hundreds of valiant workers. Surely we have to do everything feasible to prevent these figures going even higher as a result of the Delta variant, or any future variants. There’s no doubt that this is what the government is seeking to achieve in moving to a compulsory vaccination approach – it’s a defensive strategy, based on the fear of a challenging winter battling coronavirus, plus maybe seasonal flu, to come. Yet I know that Age UK was by no means the only organisation with an interest in social care that did not express full-blooded support for the idea when responding to the government’s recent consultation. Of course, it is in older people’s best interests for everyone who engages with them to be fully vaccinated, whether they live in a care home or their own home. What we were less convinced about was whether compulsorily vaccinating this particular group of care staff, and doing it now, is the best way of getting there.
The big potential problem with going down the mandatory path is that it may cause some care home staff to move to another job they can do without having their Covid-19 jabs. There is huge annual churn in social care, with as many as one in three staff leaving their roles. Some quit care altogether but many go to another company, lured by better terms and conditions. Care home staff could also move to become healthcare assistants in the NHS, with better pay and prospects for doing an almost identical job – one of many problems that bedevil social care recruitment and retention. The risk of some vaccine-hesitant care home staff leaving would matter much less if the care workforce was in better shape overall. There are some 120,000 vacancies, so about one in 10 roles are unfilled. Social care is the consummate “people job”, so the quality of care someone receives in a care home, for example, depends not only on the skills of the staff but on there being enough of them. An older person with advanced dementia may require painstaking one-on-one support to eat and drink enough during the day. If that’s impossible because of understaffing then they are at major risk of malnutrition and dehydration, threatening their health and even their survival. One of the strongest arguments against mandatory vaccination, therefore, is that it risks making an already challenging workforce situation worse, with awful consequences for residents. Remember, too, that these new regulations will hit temporary agency staff, on whom care homes have previously relied to fill gaps, as well as permanent workers. This is not the only recent blow to the social care workforce. Brexit and the immigration rules that the government subsequently introduced mean that, as things stand, care workers from the EU will be unable in future to come here to work. There are anecdotal reports that Brexit has led to some existing EU care staff returning home. Such staff are mostly clustered in London and other big cities, some of the places where vaccine hesitancy among staff is also known to be most prevalent – partly because there are greater numbers of black African staff who academic research have found to be considerably more averse to taking up the vaccine than their white British counterparts. Care homes in these areas therefore potentially face a double whammy as regards staffing, if mandatory vaccination leads some workers to leave, on top of Brexit. I could contemplate mandatory vaccination as a last resort, but I’m not sure that everything that could be done to encourage voluntary take-up among care home staff has been fully tried. The NHS has run some excellent myth-busting webinars for care workers, but many will no doubt have missed out. The experience to date is that hyper-local approaches, based on peer-to-peer support, really do work. With the government announcing a 16-week grace period before the new regulations bite, I hope care homes and councils will work together to encourage every worker who is yet to take up their jab to do so, especially in those areas with the furthest to go. This policy change would have landed so much better if it had been part of a funded package of reforms, designed to give care workers the professional respect they richly deserve, and pay and conditions to match. It’s not impossible that this will come later in the year but, on its own, mandatory vaccination feels to me and many others like too much stick and not enough carrot for a workforce who have given their all and been through the fire these past 15 months, quite possibly with more to come.

125472,commentisfree/2021/jun/29/did-gladys-berejiklian-wait-too-long-to-lock-down-sydney,Opinion,"Did Gladys Berejiklian wait too long to lock down Sydney? | Peter Collignon, Zoë Hyde and Hassan Vally",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/29/did-gladys-berejiklian-wait-too-long-to-lock-down-sydney,"I don’t think NSW delayed too long – but time will tell I don’t think New South Wales waited too long to “lock down”. Lockdowns cause a lot of social and economic harms, so we need to ensure they are not put in place too early and before other less severe forms of restrictions would have achieved the same result – namely stopping ongoing and ever-increasing transmission rates. In my view the main criterion for a lockdown is when we see a large number of unlinked cases occurring. If there are a lot of “mystery” cases, then for every case identified there is a least one other infected person still freely moving around in the community. But in NSW so far, while there have been increasing daily new case numbers, nearly all the identified cases are linked. Most are already in isolation or at least aware they are casual contacts.
Another factor that influences decisions on restrictions are increasingly large numbers of new cases per day. Once you get large numbers of new cases per day, your case-finding abilities can get overwhelmed. So far that hasn’t happened in NSW, but that will become a limiting factor if daily numbers continue to increase. With increasing numbers of new cases, more severe restrictions are needed to limit further spread if many of these people were not already in isolation. But to answer the question of how much of a difference a lockdown in NSW would have made and its timing, we will only get a good idea through the number of new cases occurring per day over the next week and how many of these were not already in “quarantine” at home. We need to remember that any intervention, including lockdowns, will take at least five to seven days before we see an effect on case numbers. This is because the average incubation period is about five days. So the data over the next week, and more importantly a week from now, will be critical to help answer this question. Peter Collignon is an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at the Australian National University and a member of the Infection Control Expert Group which advises the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on infection prevention and control issues. Going hard and fast is the only way to beat exponential growth There’s been a lot of talk about NSW taking a “proportionate” response to Covid-19, but in reality, taking decisive action to eliminate the virus delivers the best outcomes for both health and the economy. It’s simply not possible to “learn to live” with Covid-19 before we’ve achieved herd immunity through vaccination.
Because the virus grows exponentially, having even just a few cases in the community leaves Australia on a knife-edge. This was always the case, but the Delta variant has magnified the risk. If no restrictions were in place, a person infected with the original strain of the virus would infect about two-and-a-half other people on average. The Delta variant has increased that to six. Keep putting six times six into your calculator and see what you come up with. Going “hard and fast” is the only way to beat exponential growth. Once there’s transmission of the Delta variant in the community, it’s likely that a lockdown is the only way to get rid of it. But lockdowns are most effective when they’re used early. Early action not only gives the best chance of stamping out Covid-19 quickly, it also results in faster economic recovery. A short but sharp lockdown is likely to deliver better health and economic outcomes than delaying action and then subsequently having to introduce prolonged restrictions. Had the NSW government reacted swiftly with a snap lockdown in the early stages of the outbreak, it may have been able to avoid the longer lockdown that Sydney now faces. If we’ve learned anything from Melbourne’s second wave, it’s that there’s no way to avoid a long lockdown if the virus has built up momentum. I hope it’s not too late for Sydney to avoid that.
Zoë Hyde is an epidemiologist based at the University of Western Australia There is no place for politics when it comes to fighting the virus It’s important to remember that the decision to go into lockdown is dependent on two main considerations. Firstly, it involves assessing the risk of Covid transmission getting away from you based on the information available, which is always incomplete. And secondly, it is dependent on your tolerance for risk; that is, the level of risk you are willing to take on that things could get away from you if you don’t impose strong restrictions. The decision to go into lockdown is one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Lockdowns are brutal and costly, both personally and economically. So there’s no doubt that trying to avoid a lockdown is a worthwhile aspiration. They are a sledgehammer, which may be necessary sometimes, but it’s better for everyone if we can achieve the same result by using a scalpel. So what can we make of what has happened in NSW? Despite the numbers of cases that were identified over the past week, I think there was a reasonable argument early on that this cluster could be brought under control without a lockdown given that cases were linked and it appeared that contact tracers were keeping up with transmission. But things can change quickly, and the discovery of a separate and previously undetected chain of transmission involving the seafood handler tipped the risk-benefit equation, which was delicately balanced, in a drastic way, making the decision for a lockdown the only course of action. Whether NSW should have called a lockdown earlier will be debated vigorously, and much will rest on how things transpire in the coming weeks. What is clear is that we are going to have to start to get a bit more tolerant of risk as time goes on. However, the difficulty is that the landscape is constantly changing, with the latest challenge being factoring in the increased transmissibility of new variants of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The one thing that is really clear, however, is that there is no place for politics when it comes to fighting the virus and like the rest of Australia I am hoping that NSW is able to get on top of this situation as soon as possible.

But as the rest of the world emerges into a post-Covid world, some of us living overseas look at our country of origin and wonder if it offers us a home worth returning to. Some may ask the question simply because they don’t have the money to come back. My home state of Queensland is currently charging $3,710 for two weeks of confinement for two people. With Qantas’ international flights suspended, there’s thousands to spend even before you get to cool your heels in a Marriott for 14 days. Even for those with the means, but who still have to work for a living, two weeks in a hotel makes a visit impractical.
It’s obvious this is designed as a disincentive. Anyone who isn’t wealthy or desperate will stay where they are, and thus reduce the burden on a patchwork of quarantine arrangements which have already encountered multiple failures. I, along with many other Australians resident in countries with more effective vaccine rollouts, am fully vaccinated. If the measures were simply about public health, that would make a difference. Currently, it does not. That brings us to the political dimension of Australia’s Covid response. For a quarter century refugees have been used as a political football, to the extent that mandatory detention and a blanket denial of resettlement is now bipartisan public policy. Not coincidentally, many Australians appear to experience closed borders as a kind of psychological security blanket. Sealed borders – at national and state levels – have been popular and by now are a lever governments pull at the smallest hint of trouble. If they’re feeling any significant pressure to reopen the country, it’s not evident in their actions. For all of that, it’s not clear from where I stand that Australian governments have made the most of the opportunity they had when the virus was initially at bay. In the months Australians seem to have spent largely on interstate bickering, the United States has vaccinated more than half of its population. There is a lot of blame to go around for that. The federal government botched procurement and did an appalling sales job on the Covid vaccine they managed to acquire. State governments have shown wildly variable competence in managing outbreaks. But governments were square-dancing with the selfishness and entitlement of a segment of the resident population. Some decided that the vaccine on offer was just not good enough for them, even though the chances of developing side effects from AstraZeneca are as little as four in a million for those over 55. Those odds are far better than the chances of catching Covid-19, or of being hospitalised, or of dying once you have it. Many people not only ignored this, but dreamed up conspiracy theories asserting that the vaccine was procured in order to fatten the wallets of government ministers. I’m fortunate enough to be able to contemplate the monetary cost of coming back. I might even be able to make the time. But what I’ve observed about Australia from overseas may be a more telling disincentive. I look at Australia and see a claustrophobic and insular place, which appears disconnected from the world that is putting itself back together after the pandemic.
I also notice that Australians like to flatter themselves over their response to the pandemic. It’s true that aside from the anomalous case of Victoria, outbreaks have been well contained, with contact-tracing working well to rein them in. But it rarely seems to occur to Australians how much good fortune they have enjoyed in having sole possession of an island. That island is not really a thoroughfare to anywhere else except for New Zealand and the other island nations in the region, whose successes in controlling the epidemic have been even more striking. The United States was an unremitting horror show in 2020 as the virus surged first in spring, and then even more aggressively in winter. The Trump administration’s response was little short of criminal. Since January however, things have unfolded quite differently, and the medical workers, government officials and ordinary people have acted in a way that cannot help but inspire feelings of loyalty. Vaccines are being freely administered anywhere where this can practically be done – in pharmacies, convention centres, government buildings and even open fields. Slowly, haltingly, life is beginning to look recognisable again. No sane person would say that the US is better off for the enormous, and ultimately needless, loss of life it has endured. But it has meant that few people here – except for Trumpist diehards on the conspiracist right – are operating under any illusions. Everyone holding or receiving a needle knows that Covid-19 is here to stay. Messaging from agencies like the CDC has shifted to talk about the need for booster shots as new variants emerge.
This pathogen is, now, a part of the furniture, like seasonal colds and flus, an ever-present danger around which we will have to subtly but definitively restructure our lives. AstraZeneca presents a small but manageable risk, especially to over 59s. Covid-19 is a killer in our midst. It’s true that a wealthy and powerful country should never have crumbled in the face of the virus as the US did in 2020. But the same can be said for Australia’s 2021, where the precious advantage of time is being squandered. Despite the fact I have been fully vaccinated for months, and notwithstanding my possession of the same passport that residents have, by the time Australia reopens it’s likely I won’t have seen a single family member for three years. I have developed a clear impression – especially after citizens in India were told that returning to Australia could land them in prison – that after political calculations about the pandemic have been made, an expatriate’s passport isn’t worth much. The country where I live as a guest has treated me far better than the one that happened to issue that passport. Perhaps it’s time to trade up.",2021-06-27 17:30:30+00:00,125677,2
126085,commentisfree/2021/jun/25/unvaccinated-britain-vaccination-covid-hospitalisations,Opinion,"With 21 million still unvaccinated, Britain is not out of the woods yet | Azra Ghani and Oliver Watson",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/25/unvaccinated-britain-vaccination-covid-hospitalisations,"This week the steady rise of Covid cases in the UK was accompanied by a worrying signal of rising hospital admissions. Of most concern was the notable increase in the number of people becoming severely ill and requiring mechanical ventilation. It seems clear that the UK has entered a third Covid-19 wave, which raises the question: to what extent will vaccines protect the NHS from unmanageable strain? The growth of Covid cases across the UK should come as no surprise. The Delta variant is now clearly established and has 20%-60% higher transmissibility than the previous Alpha variant. According to Public Health England, there were 35,204 new cases resulting from the variant last week, and 117 deaths of people confirmed to have the variant and to have had a positive test in the last 28 days. A single dose of the vaccine is also less effective against this new variant. Reported cases continue to be concentrated in younger age groups, many of whom will only now be receiving their first vaccinations. So, while 60% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, 40% remain susceptible – some 21 million people. Coupled with children, this large unvaccinated population is clearly sufficient to drive a third wave of cases. The issue now is whether high vaccine uptake in the UK has broken the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Although vaccines are having a major impact both in reducing the level of virus circulating in the community and in limiting the number of people requiring hospitalisation, they should not be viewed as a magic bullet. Vaccines are imperfect; a fraction of those who are fully vaccinated will still become infected and develop mild symptoms, while a smaller fraction may require hospitalisation and be at risk of dying. Uptake of vaccines has been remarkably high across the UK, with 96% of adults aged 50 and over having received at least one dose and 92% fully vaccinated according to the latest reports from NHS England (with similar levels across Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales). The latest data from Public Health England shows that the vaccines reduce the risk of hospital admission (and hence death) by close to 95%. However, if all adults over 50 were exposed to the virus, the 4% of those who have not been vaccinated would remain at risk, while 5% of those vaccinated – the remaining 96% of the population – could also be at risk of hospitalisation. Combined, this would work out as just under 9% of the over-50 population remaining at risk of hospitalisation. In percentages, these numbers appear small. But multiply that up to the whole population – nearly 26 million people over the age of 50 in the UK – and the numbers at risk soon become large. Based on data from previous waves, we could see between 5%-10% of those infected needing hospital treatment. In addition, vaccine uptake is not uniform across the UK, with coverage lower in some geographical areas and population groups (including black and minority ethnic populations) than others. This is likely to result in localised outbreaks that spread into the wider community. Critically, during the previous waves the aim was to keep the R number below 1 so that the epidemic did not take off. Even at its maximum growth in late 2020, R was rarely higher than 1.5. With vaccines in place, we are clearly in a much better position than last winter, with the risk of onward transmission reduced. This reduction in the R number is important because it also reduces the risk of infection in the most vulnerable populations. However, current levels of vaccination are not holding R below the critical threshold of 1: the most recent estimates suggest R is currently in the range of 1.2-1.4. This is in part due to the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant. We should therefore be prepared for cases to continue to rise over the coming weeks – possibly increasing further with the final relaxation of restrictions.
Given this, the recent increase in hospitalisations is concerning. Although most of these admissions are among people who are not fully vaccinated, these could still translate to large numbers of patients requiring care, placing a strain on an already over-burdened NHS that is struggling to cope with the backlog of routine care that has built up over the past 18 months. It is therefore critical to continue to address the concerns of the small number of people hesitant to take the vaccine so the risk can be reduced further. However, there will also be a minority among the fully vaccinated for whom the vaccine will not offer full protection. The only way to guard this group is to continue to limit ongoing transmission of the virus in the community – both through the continued vaccination of the younger age groups and by keeping in place the least damaging social-distancing measures through the summer. This way we can reduce the possible dangers of a third wave. Vaccination has changed the relationship between cases and hospitalisations, but it has not entirely broken the link. As infections rise, hospitalisations will also rise, albeit at a much slower rate than before. The data over the coming weeks will be critical for understanding this new relationship and the risks that the third wave of transmission now underway will pose. We face the same question as in previous waves – how do we balance the risks from the approaching surge in a way that minimises the impact of ongoing restrictions on society? The difference this time is that we have the vaccines, which make the balancing act that much easier to manage. Azra Ghani is professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London.

126438,commentisfree/2021/jun/24/even-with-the-sydney-outbreaks-covid-vaccines-are-already-doing-their-job-and-were-all-better-off-for-it,Opinion,"Even with the Sydney outbreaks, Covid vaccines are already doing their job – and we’re all better off for it | Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/24/even-with-the-sydney-outbreaks-covid-vaccines-are-already-doing-their-job-and-were-all-better-off-for-it,"It’s been a worrying month for Australia. First we saw an outbreak in Victoria which led to a lockdown in the state, followed by another outbreak in New South Wales which has also resulted in the reintroduction of control measures that we all had hoped were a thing of the past. It’s already feeling like a long, exhausting winter. But even in this dark hour, there is a ray of sunshine bringing some really good news – Covid-19 vaccines are already doing their job, and we’re all better off for it. We may not see the effect of our immunisations very clearly yet – it is, unfortunately, quite hard to see the cases of disease that never happened – but they are definitely there even though we are far from the lofty heights of the herd immunity threshold.
This sounds confusing, because the message has often felt like it’s herd immunity or bust, but it turns out that this is mostly just a miscommunication about what herd immunity is. Rather than thinking about herd immunity as a fixed threshold above which there is only joy and below which are the darkest reaches of Hades, think of it as a spectrum where any proportion of people being immune to a disease reduces the spread of that infection by a meaningful amount. You can actually think about this in terms of the numbers. Let’s take the basic reproductive number (R) of Covid-19 that’s commonly used as a best estimate, 2.5, meaning that on average an infected person will spread the disease to another 2.5 individuals. Assuming that our vaccine is 70% effective against infection (a bit lower than the efficacy seen in scientific studies of AstraZeneca), we can think about how protected we are against this original Covid-19 strain already. We know that about six million vaccine doses have been given in Australia so far. Using data from some of the states, it seems that about five million of these are first doses and one million second, so roughly 20% of all Australians have received at least one dose of a vaccine against Covid-19 (nearly 30% of adults). Now, many of those doses have been given quite recently, and it takes a while for vaccines to get to their full effect. Moreover, our immunisations are most effective after the second dose, which helps to prevent infection. However, this gives us a useful schema for thinking about how protected we already are by our vaccinations. With 20% of the population immunised using a 70% effective vaccine, we’d expect that the R of Covid-19 would be reduced by about 14%, from 2.5 down to 2.15. This may sound small, but it’s in line with the benefits that studies have identified from interventions such as banning public events and closing schools. Given the exponential nature of initial outbreaks, that sort of reduction could easily be the difference between an out-of-control epidemic and something that we can quickly get a lid on. Even if you start thinking about more transmissible variants, this level of vaccine protection is still pretty impressive. Assuming we’re talking about a variant that is double as transmissible as our initial strain, we’d be looking at a reduction from an R of 5 down to 4.3, which is quite a big reduction. But the real payoff comes when very large numbers of people are vaccinated. Once you have 50% of the population immunised, we’d expect to see the reproductive number fall by more than a third. With 70% vaccinated, it’s more like 50% reduced. Getting to these very high numbers of vaccinations means the spread of disease falls far enough that we could probably control it entirely with just our fantastic contact-tracing teams and not need to rely on other measures at all.
Ultimately, the point is that herd immunity is more complex than a single number, and vaccines are pretty amazing. Even with only 30% of our adults having received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, we’re already reaping the benefits of a population that is less susceptible to the disease than it was before. Once we get up to the really high rates, we might be able to relax a lot more about the future that the pandemic holds. Of course, there are many unknowns here: we may need to combine vaccine regimens for best effect, or have boosters in the years to come. We may not feel comfortable relaxing even once it’s possible, because the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on our collective mental health. But it is very reassuring to see Australian vaccination numbers climb regardless. The pandemic is not over yet – there are still horrifying tolls being seen every day in lower-income nations across the world – but with vaccine rates climbing there is hope for our future here in Australia. And on a personal note, I should be getting my second AstraZeneca jab sometime next week. • Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist working in chronic disease",2021-06-23 22:39:50+00:00,126439,2
126810,commentisfree/2021/jun/22/covid-vaccines-mandatory-healthcare-sector-workers,Opinion,Why suggesting mandatory Covid vaccines is an ethical minefield | Melinda Mills ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/22/covid-vaccines-mandatory-healthcare-sector-workers,"Last week we learned of a government consultation expected to announce mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations for care home staff, and possibly NHS staff too. This sparked debate as to the ethics and legality of such a move, not to mention the strain it could put on an already beleaguered workforce. A number of stakeholders opposed the move, from NHS providers to the British Medical Association. But it is not just the healthcare sector that is weighing up such considerations: a recent survey in the US and UK found that 9 in 10 employers will encourage or require vaccination and 60% plan to make them mandatory.
Countries like the UK and the US have libertarian roots and value individual freedom. Those against mandatory vaccinations are not necessarily anti-vaxx or even unvaccinated. Rather, some are legitimately concerned about the mission creep of government and employers infringing into personal lives. But where do we draw the line between individual freedom of beliefs and the rights of others? You can choose not to wear a seatbelt and if you crash, you might die. But being unvaccinated and returning to a crowded workplace not only means you are driving without a seatbelt, but it removes the seatbelt of those around you. It exposes that 12-year-old who hasn’t been offered the vaccine, the young waiter who hasn’t had her second jab yet and the delivery driver who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. There are precedents for mandatory vaccination programmes. New medical staff carrying out certain procedures are required to prove they are non-infectious for hepatitis B, C and HIV and are offered a hepatitis B vaccination. The US and Australia have long mandated vaccination for entry into school to increase and sustain vaccination rates. In 2016, six months after the Australian government brought in the “no jab, no pay” policy (no vaccination, no family tax benefits), there were record highs of vaccination of young children in previously hard-to-vaccinate groups. But financial disincentives are not always effective since many objectors have relatively high socioeconomic resources. When France and Italy faced a measles outbreak, they made childhood vaccinations mandatory in 2017-18, although the Italian mandate was later repealed. A recent study found that mandatory vaccine policies for preventable diseases such as measles increased uptake and lowered measles incidence. In countries with no option for non-medical vaccination exemption (for example no ethical anti-vaccination clause), the incidence of measles was significantly lower. Another consideration before implementing any kind of mandatory programme here in the UK would be the extent of the problem the solution is trying to address: we don’t want to use a metaphorical sledgehammer to crack a walnut. A recent study found that the UK has the highest vaccine confidence internationally at almost 90%. In a Royal Society report, we mapped seasonal flu vaccine uptake among healthcare workers in England in 2019-20. Around 75-80% of frontline workers, doctors, nurses, clinical and support staff were vaccinated, but in some smaller trusts, levels were only 40% even among doctors, and lower still among support staff. These are all considerations that apply as much to the private sector as to the public. Goldman Sachs told US workers they must disclose their vaccination status to their managers. The publisher Bloomsbury will make vaccines compulsory for UK staff. As those able to work from home begin to contemplate their return to the office, it may prove unfeasible for private sector companies to demand mandatory vaccinations for employees. Although many US companies are enacting these rules, according to English law, telling a member of staff they may be dismissed if they are not vaccinated could constitute unfair dismissal. An employer needs to provide a good reason for dismissal and it seems unclear whether vaccination constitutes a good enough reason. At the same time, employers must abide by health and safety requirements. If a workspace is cramped, with employees in close proximity to others, or unventilated, could vaccination be an effective safety measure to ensure the protection of those employees? These are opposing considerations employers must address. Employers could also face a discrimination claim. Some workers might have legitimate medical grounds such as an allergy preventing them from being vaccinated. Employers have the duty of reasonable accommodation to protect that person. There are also younger age groups patiently waiting to get their first or second jab. Given that young employees populate some sectors, such as hospitality, this is not a trivial point. Perhaps the thorniest issue of all is that discrimination claims can be made not only on medical grounds, but also on philosophical beliefs. An employment tribunal recently made the ruling that veganism is a philosophical belief protected under the Equality Act of 2010. Could anti-vaxxism be a protected philosophical belief? For a belief to be protected, it has to jump through a series of hoops such as being worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatibility with human dignity, but crucially – not be in conflict with the fundamental rights of others. Legal experts need to mull over whether anti-vaxxism could in some circumstances be a protected philosophical belief like veganism if someone is not hired or dismissed because of their vaccination status – or whether it conflicts with the fundamental rights of others and public health. Even if it is possible and it works, should employers make vaccination mandatory? Or is a carrot more effective than a stick? Instead of always bringing out the stick, it might be more effective to cultivate carrot policies. Remember that we struggle to assess our own risk, from overestimating our risk of a blood clot to keenly buying lottery tickets. Experiments in the US found that giving someone a date, time, convenient location and saying “this vaccine is personally reserved for you” has improved results in terms of vaccinate uptake. Building carrot policies and incentives to help workers understand why vaccination protects might be more effective than the mandatory stick, while we cannot forget that the central crux of the vaccination conundrum is this: protecting the fundamental right of one might endanger the wellbeing of another.

126851,commentisfree/2021/jun/22/viruses-wearing-mask-england-vaccines,Opinion,Vaccines are not magic bullets – we'll still have to take precautions | Zania Stamataki,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/22/viruses-wearing-mask-england-vaccines,"Boris Johnson’s government is pushing back the release of lockdown restrictions in England by four weeks, despite the UK being in the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of vaccine doses administered. Reasonably, people are asking: why the need for prolonged restrictions when the rollout has been so successful? What does a safe level of vaccination look like? To date, 46.8% of the population are fully vaccinated in the UK and 64.2% have received one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The jabs approved in the UK use the virus’s spike protein to educate our immune system so when it meets the real thing, it can produce antibodies and T-cells that recognise this spike and control the infection. After the first vaccination (or natural infection) it takes a couple of weeks to expand the relevant immune cells, but then memory cells protect us from severe disease in future infections. In previously infected people, the first vaccination acts like a booster, helping them retain antiviral immunity for longer. Immunological memory duration differs for different viruses, and this is why we need to monitor how long protection lasts for new vaccines and viruses, enabling us to work out when we need booster vaccinations. The second vaccination in two-dose regimens acts to increase the power and duration of immunity after the first jab. We appreciate that immunity may wane a few months to a year after coronavirus infection, but the timing of this has yet to be established following vaccination. Given the pressing clinical need and early sparsity of vaccine doses, the initial decision was taken to vaccinate at an interval of 12 weeks for two-dose vaccines. This helped us protect the most vulnerable faster, despite some vaccines being tested only at eight-week intervals in clinical trials. The latest advice is to bring forward the second jab appointments to eight weeks, to help keep us safe from a third wave of infection. Vaccines, however, are not magic; they do nothing to stop us being exposed to a virus if someone sneezes over us, and this is why restrictions still play a role. Vaccines do help reduce the opportunities for the virus to take hold and the intensity of an infection’s aftermath, while cutting down transmission. So far, they are estimated to have saved 12,000 lives in England alone, and prevented more than 30,000 hospitalisations. Most vaccinated people will show mild symptoms or none at all when infected. But symptoms may also depend on the variant. There is still a chance that vaccinated people will pass the virus on, particularly at super-spreader events and with highly transmissible variants, such as the Delta variant now predominant in the UK. As new variants that carry mutated spike proteins emerge, the effect of our current jabs may be reduced and the vaccines will require updating. But right now, there is evidence that our vaccines are protective against the Delta variant. So what does a safe level of vaccination look like, in order to protect those unable to have a jab and achieve herd immunity? It depends on the virus, and this coronavirus has a few tricks up its sleeve. At the beginning of the pandemic, experts estimated that about 70% of the population needed to be vaccinated to keep everyone safe from severe disease, but the Delta variant is more transmissible than the original virus, and the new estimate is closer to 85%. We are on the right track, with cautious restrictions and extending the vaccine rollout, and upcoming school closures for the summer are on our side. We have to continue taking personal precautions to stop the spread, or new variants will emerge that will eventually escape the vaccines we have now. We are also rightly planning for a booster jab programme in the autumn, which itself raises questions, such as how to safely combine Covid vaccinations with winter flu jabs. The aim is to reduce the risk as much as possible for everyone; we don’t yet fully understand long Covid, or the impact of infection on tissues such as the brain. Until the majority of us are fully protected and infection rates are brought back under control, I will continue to wear my mask in busy places and indoors after restrictions are lifted. We must do all we can to protect the effectiveness of our vaccines for as long as possible, or we will find ourselves back at square one. I will also continue to monitor immunity in vaccinated people, because we don’t know yet how long protection will last. When immunity starts to wane, we need to detect this through immune surveillance tests and invite those who are vaccinated to get booster jabs of the same or updated vaccines, as needed, in the years to come. There is still some way to go out of this pandemic. Dr Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham",2021-06-22 05:00:51+00:00,126852,2
126989,commentisfree/2021/jul/31/shame-anti-vaxxers-dumb-sick,Opinion,Should we shame the anti-vaxxers? That can only backfire | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/31/shame-anti-vaxxers-dumb-sick,"An email arrived from my cousin this week outlining how bad Covid cases are in her part of South Africa. Delta is surging, she wrote; their friends and neighbours were starting to die. Meanwhile, vaccination rates were terrible, with less than 5% of the population fully vaccinated. After filling me in on the rest of the family news, she assured me that she and her husband were on the waiting list for vaccines – for what it was worth. Her husband, she said, was “convinced they’re not safe”. This was information to me. Not that a member of my extended family differed from me in his thoughts about drug trials and government-agency approval, but more broadly: wow, I had no idea my cousin was married to a lunatic. This was a reflex response. At an odd time in the life of the pandemic, when every step forward is seemingly followed, immediately, by a jump in the numbers and a hasty step back, there is one, cast-iron certainty: that given the opportunity to call someone else crazy, it is almost impossible to turn down. This consolation is particularly available in the United States at the moment, where a third of Americans eligible for the vaccine remain stubbornly unjabbed. (By contrast, in Britain, 88% of those eligible have received at least one dose.) That these vaccine holdouts fall demographically along existing lines of political division has made dismissing them as fanatics much easier. Under-vaccinated populations in the US skew heavily towards traditionally Republican areas in the south and midwest, particularly among those without college degrees. Articles abound about idiots partying, for example at a lake in Missouri. (“Personally,” says an unmasked, unvaccinated bartender serving unmasked, unvaccinated patrons, “I feel like my immune system is doing a good job, so why pump it full of something that we don’t really know what it is?”) The popular image of the vaccine-hesitant American is of a Trump supporter, his limited capacities further eroded by too much time spent absorbing the work of online conspiracy theorists. Aspects of this image may well be true. The fact remains, however, that liberal disparagement of the vaccine-hesitant rests on a double standard. If we think of vaccine holdouts as taking their cues not from neutral information but from pre-existing narratives (democrats are bad; government is bad; it’s all a hoax) this is a dynamic we’re not entirely free from ourselves. The enjoyment one gets, when confronted with an anti-vaxxer from saying “these people are nuts”, and fitting them instantly into the category of dumb asshole, clearly delivers an emotional dividend as strong as the ones being indulged on the other side.
And the Covid anti-vax demographic isn’t entirely clear-cut. Lots of parents who didn’t think twice about giving their children MMR vaccines, for example, are on the fence about what to do in the autumn, when the US Food and Drug Administration will almost certainly approve the vaccine for the under-12s. I’ve heard similarly anxious murmurs from pregnant women getting their shots. The closest I’ve come to understanding this mindset arose one afternoon, when I thought about the assurances given to women by the British government during the thalidomide scandal in the 1960s. For a second, I could feel it: the appeal of thinking that the real credulity here is blind faith in the government. It didn’t last. Neither, perhaps, will the tendency among those who are vaccinated to disparage those who remain hesitant, for the simple reason that it will backfire and end up hurting us more. During the first flush of the vaccine rollout in the US, there was a collective sense among the vaccinated population of: big deal, if they’re dumb enough not to get the vaccine, let them get sick. Now, thanks to the latest advances in armchair epidemiology, we understand that if large portions of the population remain unvaccinated, not only will society’s reopening be compromised but it will provide a petri dish for possible vaccine-resistant strains of the virus to develop in. “Let them get sick” has evolved into a refrain that was familiar during the Trump years, for different reasons: “My God, these people are going to get us all killed.” Calling them dumb assholes, therefore, while it can feel really good, isn’t a helpful strategy in winning people around to your side of the argument. This week Kay Ivey, Republican governor of Alabama, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the US, said: “Time to start blaming the unvaccinated.” And you understood her point of view. Yet pointing the finger doesn’t work. “We all but shamed people,” Johnny Taylor, head of the Society for Human Resource Management, told the New York Times this week in reference to private companies’ initiatives to persuade hesitant staff to get vaccinated. “But now we’re at a point that none of that’s working and we’ve got to close the gap.” Offering people $100 for getting your shot, as President Biden has urged states to do, may work for some people; others may end up being forced to take it. (Biden has announced that the country’s entire civilian federal workforce – well over 2 million people – will require vaccination too.) Meanwhile, I’m trying to push back against the temptation to ask my cousin what’s wrong with her husband, and in the process be less shut down myself. “Why does he think that?” I said.

But if you make it illegal and let people know that, then they probably won’t do it. Because they’ll no longer be able to. That’s the thing when it comes to the thorny balance between individual responsibility, liberty and state guidelines in a crisis: people need to be told firmly, unambiguously, from those in authority the precise rules and health advice – especially regarding vaccinations.
Amid the recent unholy scramble to vilify a number of individuals for transmitting (active voice) the virus (not least “patient zero”, an unvaccinated airport transport worker, and the removalist brothers with limited English whose mother subsequently died of Covid-19) it should be remembered that the biggest hiccups in fighting the disease have resulted from systemic federal and state government failures and errors. This includes dramatic communications derelictions when it comes to clear vaccination advice. Who should take AstraZeneca is, perhaps, the greatest case in point. The federal government, its often absent communicator-in-chief being Scott Morrison, has in recent months advised us to get AZ if you are aged 50 or over … err, no, only if you are over 60, but do take it if you’re 40 or way younger – but only if your doctor agrees. And just by the way we, the government, will indemnify doctors administering the AZ. What message does the stated need for indemnity send to those of any age considering the AstraZeneca?
If a government had intended to undermine public confidence in the safety of a statistically-on-balance safe and efficient vaccine against the Delta variant, such garbled communication would do the trick.
Yet this was apparently accidental. Some marketing, eh, from a PM whose name is supposedly synonymous with it! The vaccine rollout itself has, perhaps, been the greatest systemic failure. Delta is spreading like wildfire through locked-down Sydney now because when the latest strain hit such a small number of people (now just 17% nationally) were fully vaccinated. But good governments learn from their mistakes, right? Last year, the saddest, cruellest human calamity associated with the virus were the 655 aged care deaths in Victoria. After the aged care royal commission’s report into the virus’s terrible carnage in the sector and a Commonwealth spend of $9 million in the Victorian institutions on Covid-preparedness and checks, this year brought another outbreak in Victorian aged care. Another calamity was narrowly avoided. Yet the relevant minister had no idea how many nursing home staff or residents were vaccinated even though the Morrison government had vowed most vulnerable Australians would receive their inoculations by last Easter.
It was late June – by which time Sydney was already well and truly locked down due to the spread of Delta – when the federal government announced that aged care workers would have to get one vaccination … by mid-September. Why was this not done far earlier? We know the answer – the absence of available vaccines. Now comes the revelation that frighteningly few of the 150,000 in-home carers of the elderly (some visit multiple private houses in a day) are actually vaccinated. Another system failure. Meanwhile, the prime minister is having an apparent “on” phase when it comes to his on/off support of lockdowns, especially in Sydney; of course it’s hard to argue vaccination is the answer when you’ve needlessly frightened the punters off AstraZeneca and messed up the Pfizer order. Add to all of this a federation whose national interest is eroding to the four colonial winds of narrow, sometimes petty, parochial self-interest much as it did a century ago in the face of the Spanish influenza. It is easy to fathom how the fear, confusion – and yes, white hot anger – among those who have been making necessary sacrifices while locked down – transmogrifies into a punitive sentiment against the politicians and their systems failures. Still the quest endures in some quarters to vilify certain individuals, to blame them despite their complex and sometimes ambiguous circumstances. Individuals have their responsibilities, of course. Overwhelmingly Australians are meeting them – courageously, inequitably, fearfully, frailly, stoically – in these terrible times. There will always be exceptions where governments deny liberties for utilitarian reasons: boofhead footballers and house parties or the stupidity and selfishness of thousands marching unmasked, without social distance, for supposed “freedom” that will further imperil us and compound the denial of liberty – and the high-profile bloviators who negligently support them. The community health perils of state governments locking down too late have been demonstrated in Victoria (last year) and now, starkly, in New South Wales where initial hesitancy translates to another month inside. Victoria’s lockdowns have since been characterised by prudent, decisive speed and unambiguously harsh rules. Some of Sydney’s lockdown rules remain contrastingly opaque and ambiguous. Scratch most Australians and you’ll find a conformist. Ingrained iconoclasm, individualism and innate anti-authoritarianism are about as characteristic as that mythical egalitarianism. If lockdown rules enable some to get drunk on takeaway margaritas in the name of “exercise” they’ll go for it. If the rules don’t, they won’t. No. Government systems failures, more than wilful individual disobedience, has been the biggest problem in this crisis so far.

127178,commentisfree/2021/jul/30/republicans-used-to-laud-personal-responsibility-not-with-covid,Opinion,Republicans used to laud ‘personal responsibility’. Not with Covid | David Litt,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/30/republicans-used-to-laud-personal-responsibility-not-with-covid,"“It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions,” declared Ronald Reagan at the 1968 Republican National Convention. By the time he became president 12 years later, this idea – that individuals can be trusted to act wisely and should be held accountable when they don’t – was firmly entrenched in Republican rhetoric. Reagan even included “personal responsibility” in his list of America’s bedrock values, right up there with faith in God, honesty, and caring for others. But those days are long over – and the conservative movement’s nationwide anti-vaccination effort proves it. Political parties are large; there are plenty of responsible Republican voters, and a handful of responsible Republican politicians. But the conservative movement no longer argues that individuals are better than the government at promoting the greater good. Instead, the movement encourages its members to make objectively selfish, harmful choices, then uses the tools of government to shield them from accountability when they do. Republicans have become the party of personal irresponsibility. In most cases, it’s difficult to say with certainty that a given choice is “responsible.” But getting a Covid vaccine is not one of those cases. Getting vaccinated costs individual Americans essentially nothing – the vaccine is free, widely available, and proven safe and effective. The costs to society from Americans not getting vaccinated, however, are enormous. A larger unvaccinated population means more deadly infections among the unvaccinated and immunocompromised; it means more taxpayer dollars spent on hospitalizations, and higher health insurance premiums for everybody; it means far less certainty for small businesses desperate for the pandemic to be over so they can re-open for good. Many people have gotten the vaccine out of self-interest: they’d rather not get Covid. But even for those unconcerned by the health risks of contracting the disease, the vaccine presents a straightforward choice: take an action that benefits one’s community, or reject the idea – expressed so frequently by Reagan – that supporting one’s community is something individuals ought to do? As far as personal responsibility goes, it’s the perfect test. Which is why it’s shocking that the conservative movement has gone to such great lengths to ensure its supporters fail that test. Fox News has hosted a parade of discredited anti-vaxxers. At both the state and local level, Republican lawmakers have invited conspiracy theorists to testify before their committees, amplifying their messages. Even Mitch McConnell, who to his credit has personally encouraged constituents to get their Covid shots, has refused to publicly condemn the misinformation rampant in conservative media or speak out against his fellow Republican lawmakers, like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, who encouraged Americans to “Just say no” to the vaccine. The conservative movement hasn’t just adopted pro-choice rhetoric when it comes to vaccines. It’s gone further, encouraging people to make the choice that is clearly harmful to society at large. It’s debatable whether those who remain unvaccinated because of misinformation are to blame for trusting the wrong sources. But it’s undeniable that the right-wing media and lawmakers peddling misinformation are acting recklessly – and that the entire country is worse off as a result. Republican politicians are also using the tools of government to undermine accountability, or even transparency, when it comes to vaccinations. Texas passed legislation forbidding businesses in the state from requiring proof of vaccination. Montana prohibited employers, including medical facilities, from requiring vaccination as a condition of employment. Under pressure from Republican legislators, Tennessee’s health department suspended outreach to children about not just the Covid vaccine but all childhood vaccinations. In this new, topsy-turvy definition of individual liberty, some Americans are free to put their neighbors at risk, while other Americans are barred by the government from trying to keep their own employees, customers, and even children safe. Deciding whether to get the vaccine or remain unvaccinated is technically still a choice – but the Republican party is doing everything it can to make choosing the latter easier than choosing the former. America is now reaping what the Republican Party sowed. Covid cases are soaring and deaths are up, leaving the CDC with no choice but to recommend reimposing mask mandates in much of the country – mostly to protect the unvaccinated from the potential consequences of their actions. The vaccine is the clearest example yet that the conservative movement is actively promoting, and celebrating, selfish choices. But vaccines aren’t the only example of the party of personal irresponsibility at work. Republican lawmakers have either remained silent about or defended Donald Trump’s history of tax cheating, and recently rejected increasing IRS enforcement, ensuring that other wealthy Americans are more likely to get away with not paying taxes, too. The Republican Party once promoted “responsible gun ownership” – now, Republicans in Texas and Tennessee have passed laws allowing concealed-carry handguns without permits or training. Missouri’s Republican governor promised to pardon Mark McCloskey, an attorney who threatened peaceful Black Lives Matter marchers with a firearm, if he were convicted of a crime. McCloskey has since parlayed his dangerous display of recklessness into conservative celebrity and a Senate run. Perhaps most alarmingly, a culture of irresponsibility and unaccountability has taken root among Republican elected officials. Our democratic process gives politicians enormous leeway to make choices that harm democracy: they can pass voter suppression laws; remain in office amid a prostitution scandal; or attempt to cover up an armed anti-government insurrection. But just because officials can do all these things doesn’t mean they should. And it is far from guaranteed that American democracy will survive if they do. Republicans, particularly Washington Republicans, like to tell themselves that they remain the party of Ronald Reagan - of small government, lower regulation, and faith in the individual. But it’s time for voters and politicians alike to acknowledge the new reality of American politics: the disagreement between the parties is no longer over how best to promote the general welfare; it’s over whether promoting the general welfare is worth doing at all. The Republican Party’s fall from goodness, its devolution from a party that extolled personal responsibility and accountability to a party that extols reckless disregard for one’s fellow Americans, is one of the most important trends shaping the country. And as we’re too often reminded these days, reversing that trend is a matter of life and death.

Like our prime minister, I had fallen victim to hubris and complacency. While cases were in their zeros, it seemed like I had all the time in the world to get vaccinated. Now, suddenly, I didn’t. Delta was among us. It was a strain. The first weekend of lockdown was spent online trying to get a vaccine at Sydney Olympic Park. I remembered an ancient version of myself a few weeks ago, telling a friend that I would wait because “it was a hassle getting to the vaccine place on public transport”. Two trains. Two buses. I was punished duly by spending a tedious and frustrating weekend on the New South Wales Health website and associated pages. Adrenally I jabbed refresh, refresh, refresh on the page. Catching the disease hung like a sword of Damocles as I tried to load a slow webpage. As it crashed or froze, I felt the sword lower.
Meanwhile in Sydney the numbers of Covid cases climbed. The restrictions tightened. Some nights I went back online but the official websites were still frozen. A friend called. His family medical clinic had loads of A-Zee. I could get A-Zee tomorrow. I booked in. Then the doctor from the clinic called. He said maybe I should not get the A-Zee. He had a link. A special link to a clinic he hadn’t heard of. They had Pfizer. Finally someone was sending me a “secret” link. The name came off sounding unfamiliar on his tongue. But he recommended it because of my age. I hesitated. I felt almost politically aligned now with the underdog vaccine. Plus, I was willing to take the same vaccine as my parents and millions of people around the world had taken. Plus, I had said on Twitter I was taking the A-Zee and now I had to take it. I didn’t want to add, in my own small way, to hesitancy around the A-Zee. I took the Pfizer appointment.
I had never heard of the company distributing the Pfizer vaccine – until I had it in my arm, part of me was certain it was an elaborate hoax. In my mind, this company, sprung up overnight, was going to exploit the desperation of the people and the incompetence of the government, in some elaborate but obscurely-intentioned phishing exhibition. Occasionally I would get texts from a random number from this company. “To confirm your attendance for First Dose – respond YES.” “YES,” I responded. I wanted to text back, “Are you even real?” I realised with horror that I was one of those people who thought vaccinations were a hoax – but in my case, it was for entirely different reasons. I wanted a vaccine. I believed in vaccines. I just didn’t think the hub, this operation, was real. My Monday appointment rolled around. The date was highlighted in my calendar. It was the only place I had to be in five weeks – and probably the only place I would need to be before Christmas. A thrill ran through me. Even if it was a hoax, at least I had somewhere to be. My appointment was at 6.45pm. That afternoon, I was reading, lost in a book – when suddenly it was 6.15pm. Eugh. Cutting it a bit fine. I pulled on some shoes and ordered an Uber. It was 13 minutes away. I cancelled the Uber and ordered another. It was 13 minutes away. Time was passing. Thirteen minutes would not get me there on time. I cancelled again. The next Uber was 11 minutes. I sunk into despair. I was going to miss my appointment. I would remain unvaxxed. I waited outside and nearly jumped in front of the Uber when it arrived, six minutes before my vaccine appointment. “Driver – step on it! I’m late for my first dose of Pfizer!” The driver, Xi, practically did a burnout at the end of my street, and we were off. Fate depended on me getting to the appointment in time. What if I missed out and got the Covid all because there weren’t enough Ubers on the night? “All the drivers are in south-west Sydney and can’t leave – they locked down hard,” said my driver, who was from the north shore. The streets were dark and empty, just the whirr of electric bikes of food delivery drivers. The numbers on the digital clock ticked over. There was something dramatic, cinematic and yet achingly sad about the scene. Entering the city from the east side, we swooped down Hunter Street, the skyscrapers’ lights on but everything dark and nobody around. It was like a scene from Blade Runner, like some terrible catastrophe had emptied the city. Racing through deserted streets, I was on my way to get some lifesaving medicine. Or I was speeding towards a giant hoax, a joke, a fake company, a string of clues, a cosmic puzzle – like the heroine in Thomas Pynchon’s great novel The Crying of Lot 49. We arrived at a place in the city next to a posh hotel where I once sat in the lobby and accidentally ordered a glass of wine that cost $22. A memory of a different world. Now, outside the shuttered hotel, there it was. A new vaccine clinic. There were people in high-vis vests and iPads and clipboards and PPE and a socially distanced queue. It was a dystopian scene but I was flooded with relief. I was five minutes late – but that was OK, they said. They would still give me the vaccine. It was real, it was real. All of it was real. And this was no listless queue. It vibrated with something tremulous and important. People were wanting this, were grateful to be here. Everyone was talking to each other about how lucky they felt to get an appointment. Everyone staffing the centre looked to be under 40. I felt a pang. History should be kind to them, I hope, because the present is not so great. Right now they are staffing a vaccine centre, for a vaccine they are not yet eligible for. One of their number died during the week waiting for the vaccine, Adriana Midori Takara. She couldn’t get in until October, and she died trying. This is an outrage and we should not forget it – and her. At the front of the queue I handed over my learner’s permit and Medicare card. I got shown to a booth where a young woman with a soft voice put a needle into my arm. I felt like weeping with a release from a tension I didn’t even know I was carrying. Then 15 minutes to recover in a separate room. There, a young woman was giving out chocolates and bottles of water. We are better than our leaders, I reckon. And kinder and more organised, and get things done with less fuss. I didn’t believe I would get vaccinated because, in some part of my isolation-affected imagination, I didn’t trust the competence of the government. And if I did get vaccinated, I only imagined chaos and queuing and the sort of anger that happens when strangers are thrown together in an unfamiliar place, under stress, during a pandemic. Instead it was organised and awe-inspiring. Science, in record time, has created a way out of this plague. God, we’re lucky. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",2021-07-29 17:30:39+00:00,127303,2
127358,commentisfree/2021/jul/29/to-beat-covid-no-ones-safe-until-everyones-safe-vaccines-covax,Opinion,"To beat Covid, there’s a simple lesson – no one’s safe until everyone’s safe | WHO special envoys",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/29/to-beat-covid-no-ones-safe-until-everyones-safe-vaccines-covax,"The world is witnessing the emergence of more infectious variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, but a stuttering race to ensure equitable access to vaccines has seen a handful of countries streak ahead, immunising their own populations, leaving many of the world’s vulnerable people in their wake. Communities are struggling with impatience and fatigue, which is understandable. However, easing basic public health measures such as wearing masks and social distancing risks fuelling transmission. In combination with more infectious variants and the “me first” attitude of some countries, people who are unvaccinated and those who have received only one dose are at increasing risk. The world is at a perilous point and we, the special envoys of the World Health Organization’s director general, are calling for a renewed commitment to a comprehensive approach to defeating this pandemic. We have to accelerate along two tracks – one where governments and vaccine manufacturers support all WHO member states in their efforts to create vaccine manufacturing capacity and vaccinate their most vulnerable populations, and the other where individuals and communities maintain a steely focus on continuing essential public health measures to break transmission chains. The first track requires immediate implementation of reiterated calls by the WHO and its Covax partners on the best use of vaccines. Almost 3bn doses of vaccine have been distributed globally, but only 90m of those have gone through Covax. There are at least 60 countries that rely on Covax for vaccines and those countries have vaccination rates that average less than 3%. The world must implement a strategy at global, regional and national level whereby the most vulnerable people are vaccinated first, rather than leaving health workers, elderly people and those with underlying conditions at risk of severe disease. It also includes supporting the WHO’s call to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September, and a “drive to December” to vaccinate 40% by the end of 2021. Achieving the September goal means 250 million more people in low- and middle-income countries must be vaccinated in just four months, prioritising all health workers and the most at-risk groups to save lives. Such goals align with the bold call by the WHO, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank for $50bn in increased financing to vaccinate 40% of the world’s population by the end of the year and 60% by mid-2022. Such an investment pales in comparison with the trillions of dollars of economic losses and costs connected to the pandemic.
The WHO continues working to make safe and effective vaccines and other tools available to the world, from issuing emergency use listings (EULs) for 11 vaccines so far, to launching the access to Covid-19 tools accelerator. This will spur development of and access to solutions needed to diagnose, treat and vaccinate vulnerable people in all countries, and enable developing countries to create their own vaccine manufacturing capacity. Manufacturing and diagnostic capacity, virus sequencing capacity, increased case surveillance and other measures are essential components of controlling this pandemic. Countries with the greatest stocks of vaccines should not hoard them and push to cover their entire populations while other countries do without. It is not even in their best interests, since the intense circulation of the virus in countries with no vaccines increases the possibility of more transmissible and dangerous variants, threatening to make current vaccines less effective. At the same time, the world must not lose sight of the second track which requires that everyone refresh their commitment to protecting themselves and others by recognising the importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, ventilation and other actions that have been proven to curtail the spread of the virus. Engaging with communities, building trust and empowering people to feel part of the response are the keys to inspiring them to continue, more than a year into the pandemic. The urgent call is to save lives. The world has a moral imperative to do so. Global solidarity is needed more than ever. By actively calling for a two-track approach – of ensuring that the most vulnerable people get vaccinated and adhering to sound public health measures, and by calling out those who could be doing more – the whole world can benefit and save lives. No one is safe until everyone is safe.

127385,commentisfree/2021/jul/29/covid-coronavirus-delta-variant-trump-politics,Opinion,"Covid is facing a resurgence in the US, and so is Trumpian politics | Robert Reich",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/29/covid-coronavirus-delta-variant-trump-politics,"Despair is worse after hope is briefly ignited. I don’t know about you, but I was elated earlier this spring when it seemed as if Trump and Covid were gone, and Biden seemed surprisingly able and willing to get the nation rapidly back on track.
Now much is sliding backwards. It’s not Biden’s fault; it’s Trump’s legacy. The new Delta strain of the virus requires, according to the CDC, that we go back to wearing masks inside in public places where the virus is surging, even if we’re fully inoculated. This would be nothing more than a small disappointment and inconvenience were it not for Republicans using it as another opportunity to politicize public health. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded to the new CDC recommendation with the kind of unhinged hyperbole Trumpers have perfected. “The threat of bringing masks back is not a decision based on science, but a decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state,” he said. Republican politicizing of public health will get worse if the Delta variant continues to surge. At some point vaccines will have to be mandated because being inoculated is not solely a matter of personal choice. Herd immunity is a common good. If infections mount, that common good can be achieved only if nearly everyone is vaccinated. But those eager to exploit the virus’s resurgence – the know-nothings, Trump wannabes, vilely ambitious political upcomers, Tucker Carlsons and similarly cynical entertainers – are already howling about “personal freedom” threatened by “socialism.” The investigation into the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January is further evidence of how far the Republican party has descended into opportunistic treachery. We need to know what happened and why if we are to have half a chance of avoiding a repeat. Just as with the history of systemic discrimination and brutality against Black people in America – which Republicans are calling “critical race theory” and trying to ban from classrooms – the truth shapes our responses to the future. Here again, the dispiriting aspect of the present moment is Republican denial and obfuscation. As Officer Michael Fanone – who suffered traumatic brain injury when rioters attacked him during the assault on the Capitol – testified yesterday at the start of the hearings: “What makes the struggle harder and more painful is to know so many of my fellow citizens – including so many of the people I put my life at risk to defend – are downplaying or outright denying what happened.” With the exception of Representative Liz Cheney – whom I never expected to hold up as a model of integrity – Republicans are eager to divert the public’s attention. Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik declared at a press conference on Tuesday that “Nancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on January 6.” This is absurd on its face. The Speaker of the House shares responsibility for Capitol security with the Senate majority leader, who at the time of the attack was Mitch McConnell. If Pelosi was negligent – and there’s zero evidence she was – McConnell was as well. Stefanik and other Republican leaders don’t want the public to know about Republican members of Congress who were almost certainly involved in the travesty, either directly or indirectly. The list includes Representatives Jim Jordan, Mo Brooks, Paul Gosar, Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Andrew Biggs and McCarthy himself. Senator Josh Hawley also seems to have been in the know, given his fist-salute to the rioters. And then there’s Trump himself, cheerleader and ringleader. All should be subpoenaed. All, presumably, will fight the subpoenas in court. Meanwhile, Trump continues to stage rallies for his avid followers as he did last weekend in Phoenix, where he declared, “Our nation is up against the most sinister forces … This nation does not belong to them, this nation belongs to you.” Wrong. America belongs to all of us. And we all have a responsibility to protect its public health and its democratic institutions. The real sinister force is the Trump Republicans’ cynical exploitation of lies and anti-scientific rubbish to divide and divert us. Months ago, it seemed as if this darkness was behind us. It is not.

No, but I’ll call them that if it means people will take them | Arwa Mahdawi",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/28/are-covid-jabs-trump-vaccines-no-but-ill-call-them-that-if-it-means-people-will-take-them,"Forget Pfizer or AstraZeneca, the hottest shot this summer is the Trump vaccine. Hang on, you might cry: there is no such thing. Well, Donald Trump’s former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a woman who has always had an unusual relationship with facts – begs to differ. Sanders is running for governor of Arkansas, a state with one of the lowest Covid vaccination rates in the US. She seems to want to change that: on Sunday, she published a column explaining her reasons for getting “the Trump vaccine” and arguing that Covid vaccines are safe and effective. Are you wondering whether Sanders, a Trump sycophant, has turned over a new leaf? Is it possible she suddenly cares more about the public good than political gain? I’m afraid not. Sanders, you see, wasn’t content with using her platform simply to encourage her fellow Arkansans to get vaccinated; she also took numerous jabs at Democrats. The reason some people are scared that vaccines are not safe, according to Sanders, is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s fault. If “the left truly care about increasing the vaccination rate … they should admit they were wrong to cast doubt on Operation Warp Speed and give President Trump and his team the credit they are due,” Sanders wrote. Ah yes, of course. Vaccine hesitancy is entirely the fault of Democrats and the left! Fox News stars such as Tucker Carlson, who has spent months challenging the safety of the vaccines, have absolutely nothing to do with it. It’s incredible how some conservatives, who love preaching personal responsibility, are so quick to jump at the chance to blame others. That said, it’s important to concede that Sanders isn’t entirely wrong. We can’t blame conservatives alone for politicising the vaccines. A lot of Democrats – along with liberal media outlets such as the New York Times – curried doubt about a vaccine connected to Trump. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, said last September that New York would review Covid vaccines approved by the federal government because Trump’s “election day miracle drug” was not trustworthy. Biden and Harris said they wouldn’t take Trump’s word on the vaccine. This is something liberals need to reckon with. In the meantime, if Sanders calling the various vaccines “the Trump vaccine” results in more people getting it, I’m all for it. Heck, maybe we should introduce that strategy to different areas.

127833,commentisfree/2021/jul/27/uk-two-tier-health-system-private-healthcare-nhs-waiting-lists,Opinion,England is sleepwalking towards a two-tier health system | Richard Vize,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/27/uk-two-tier-health-system-private-healthcare-nhs-waiting-lists,"The pandemic has driven both the NHS and a growing number of its patients towards private healthcare. Heightened awareness of the health service’s frailties, fuelled by repeated warnings that it could be overwhelmed, has prompted a surge in private medical insurance. As the UK drifts into a possible future of two-tier healthcare, with the wealthy given more chances to skip the queue, we need to ask whether the founding principle of the UK’s health service – free at the point of need – is being eroded in front of our eyes. There are about 90 private healthcare providers in the UK, such as HCA, Circle, Ramsay, Bupa, Spire and Nuffield Health. The industry is worth about £9bn a year, compared with £177bn of government healthcare spending across the UK in 2019. It includes hospitals, clinics, diagnostics and imaging and urgent care; typical work is general surgery, oncology, obstetrics, trauma and orthopaedics. Its customers are medical tourists, NHS referrals, people with private medical insurance and self-pay individuals – so-called “out of pocket” payers. This last group includes people paying for one-off operations to avoid waiting for NHS treatment. Ramsay earns about 80% of its revenues from NHS referrals, Spire 30%.
Alongside the private companies, many NHS hospitals – particularly specialist ones – provide private care. The Royal Marsden cancer centre’s income from private practice has been growing strongly, reaching £133m in the year to March 2020. This sort of activity is justified on the grounds it helps fund NHS care but is vehemently opposed by anti-privatisation campaigners who argue it is simply a mechanism for the wealthy to jump NHS queues in the same hospital. Private healthcare firms have done massive business with the NHS during the pandemic, worth around £2bn. In May, the Independent Healthcare Provider Network said its members carried out 3.2m procedures in the previous year for NHS patients, including more than 160,000 for cancer and cardiology. This was a lifeline for the private sector, which would have struggled to continue running with its NHS-based clinicians fully occupied in NHS hospitals tackling Covid. The company Totally has just reported record results, with revenues up 7.4% to £114m, as the impact of the pandemic on revenue from private patients was mitigated by a substantial rise in NHS work.
Most private providers have now signed a four-year deal with NHS England worth up to £10bn to help clear the NHS backlog. The final cost will depend on how many procedures are carried out. What has been noticeable in recent months is that cooperation during the pandemic, alongside the need to clear the operations backlog, has made NHS trusts a lot less squeamish about working with the private sector. Companies such as Spire are hoping for a new culture of collaboration, while Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, has talked about “an opportunity for new ways of doing things that could involve the private sector more”. Meanwhile 5.1 million people are waiting for NHS operations in England, 385,000 of whom have been waiting more than a year. The pandemic didn’t cause the problem: waiting lists have been growing since around 2013, driven by funding shortfalls, chronic workforce shortages and serious underinvestment in equipment such as scanners. Patients enduring chronic and debilitating pain, such as those waiting for hip and knee surgery, can be left for months with low quality of life, so the incentive to go private is high. The cost of a routine operation – perhaps £13,000 for hip surgery or £2,500 for cataract surgery on one eye – is within the reach of many older middle-class patients. The operation may be carried out by the same surgeon they would have had in the NHS; and they will often have a better experience, such as having a single room and seeing the same doctor. In October, as the pandemic began to surge again, HCA Healthcare reported a jump of 25-35% in self-pay patients coming from the south and south-west to its London hospitals. According to the health intelligence company LaingBuisson, self-pay healthcare is showing significant growth and is predicted to expand by another 10-15% over the next three years. Last autumn, Compare the Market said there had been an average 40% increase in year-on-year private health insurance sales over the previous seven months. About 4 million people in the UK have private medical insurance, mainly through their employer. The impact of the pandemic on NHS waiting lists worsened health inequalities, with a 31% fall in completed treatments in the most deprived areas of England compared with 26% in the least deprived. The flight to private healthcare means the poorest communities are hit three times: people are more likely to be chronically ill, more likely to be waiting for an operation and have no chance of buying their way out. The growth of a more mixed healthcare economy, in terms of both NHS treatment carried out in private sector and self-payers, is starting to normalise the idea of private healthcare. The numbers are still relatively small, and even people with comprehensive insurance are likely to need the NHS, but a waiting list with more than 5 million people on it undermines the idea of being free at the point of need. There is not much virtue in being free if the need cannot be met. If wealthier people start to buy their way out of trouble in significant numbers they will be less willing to pay taxes to improve the NHS. With public spending under intense pressure, and key figures such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove having strongly criticised the NHS in the past, there is a danger that we will look back on the pandemic as the moment that the seeds of a two-tier healthcare system were really sown.

It’s a no-brainer | Richard Nguyen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/27/i-gave-my-29-year-old-partner-the-astrazeneca-vaccine-its-a-no-brainer,"This month I gave my 29-year-old partner the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine. It was an easy decision after Scott Morrison announced that under-40s who would not otherwise be eligible for any vaccine would be able to choose to have the AstraZeneca jab. The political fallout and hyperbolic rebukes that followed the prime minister’s announcement were a hugely disappointing distraction that only further added to already negative imaging about vaccines. We have always known that vaccination is effective and a viable pathway towards normalcy. Politics should have no place in this debate.
We are in a pandemic and the risk of contracting Covid far outweighs the risks of the vaccine. Throughout this pandemic I have been an advocate of GPs doing what they do best, working at the forefront of preventative care and taking a proactive approach towards reducing Covid transmission and deaths. The vaccinations work, and whether it is AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna, the best vaccine is the one that is in your arm. Now more than ever the threat of contracting Covid in Sydney is real. The messaging surrounding AstraZeneca has been extreme at times. We know that the vaccine can cause clots but the word “rare” is often ignored. Look up the rare side-effects of any common medication and you might think it would seem safer to just not take any medication at all. My partner is on the combined contraceptive pill, which more than doubles her background risk of clot. When we start a family, the risk of clotting due to pregnancy is about one to two in 1,000 women (or up to three in 1,000 women after a cesarean section). The number of clotting cases in Australia remains low but you would be forgiven for thinking that we are getting daily cases. Yet we have three road fatalities on average each day and do not hesitate to get into our cars. AstraZeneca has been a hard sell to those eligible. “It’s a no-brainer – I would definitely do it,” is often my reply when patients ask me. “I would give my own parents the AstraZeneca vaccine,” I tell them – and now I can gladly say I have given my partner the vaccine too. I discuss the risk of complacency. I discuss how we have clear guidelines on how to identify and treat these clots early. I use the case study of Indian Covid cases ballooning from 10,000 daily to almost 400,000 – in a country that is one of the biggest AstraZeneca vaccine producers and exporters in the world. Sometimes I convince them but at other times an elderly patient with heart and lung disease would prefer to wait until there are leftover Pfizer shots. All I can do is hope that they don’t contract Covid.
The outbreak and lockdown in Sydney has vindicated what I have said for months. I resist the urge to say “I told you so” but lament the preventable predicament we’re now in. It should not be this exhausting to try to advocate for the good of the community. The risk of Covid itself sometimes seems forgotten due to Australia’s relative success in containing it. It’s almost as much a haematological disease as it is a respiratory disease. The risk of clotting from contracting it is 10 times higher than the risk of vaccination, and this risk increases exponentially if one has to be admitted to hospital or intensive care. There are specific medical reasons that make the AstraZeneca vaccine unsuitable for some but these are rare and are clearly laid out by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Usually having chronic health issues means that you need any vaccine sooner rather than later, and they are not necessarily a reason to avoid AstraZeneca. Please discuss what is best for you with your regular GP and stay safe. • Dr Richard Nguyen is a GP in southern Sydney and works part-time in a Covid-19 respiratory clinic in south-west Sydney",2021-07-27 05:56:24+00:00,127840,2
127965,commentisfree/2021/jul/26/when-england-peak-covid-infections-trajectory-pandemic,Opinion,Has England reached a peak in Covid infections? | Graham Medley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/26/when-england-peak-covid-infections-trajectory-pandemic,"While the government’s decision to remove most lockdown measures in England was widely expected to result in a large wave of infection and disease, the number of new cases of Covid-19 has been falling over the last five days. Many hope this could mean that we’re past the peak. Yet the reality is more complicated. This is the first time an epidemic has taken place in a highly vaccinated population without control measures in place, so we are in uncharted territory. There is considerable uncertainty about what the next two months hold. The big questions are how high the current wave will get and how long it will last. The number of people in hospital and dying of Covid-19 is directly linked to the number of infections. It’s impossible to accurately predict when we’ll reach the peak of infections, or how long it will take to come back down from this (if I had a pound for every time I’m asked “are we there yet?”, I’d be able to give away a lot of money). Unfortunately, we will not be able to know if we are at a peak until we have passed it, probably by a few weeks. There are several reasons for this. Though a peak is measured by the number of infections, we don’t observe this number straight away. We only see the outcome of infections. One or two days of low numbers can easily be followed by another day or two of high numbers, so it takes at least a week to establish a trend. Moreover, a change in one data stream might not be echoed in others. Reported, diagnosed cases are the earliest data collected during a pandemic, but these lag a week behind infections. A drop in cases might indicate a fall in infections, but it might also indicate there are problems with testing. If the prevalence of infection continues to rise, it’s likely that we may see problems with people getting tested, who therefore don’t appear as positive cases. And even if there are tests available, people might not use testing as much, or in the same way, in the future. Hospital admissions are a more reliable data stream. These lag a week from cases. Even then, a change in hospital admissions might be related to a change in who is getting infected. Younger people, for example, are less likely to end up in hospital. Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (React) data, which is collected from random samples, takes a couple of weeks to be processed and published. Once these show falling numbers of infections, we will have confirmation that prevalence is falling. So when we have a day with lower cases, and people ask “are we there yet?”, I will say wait a week. If cases have fallen during the week, I will point to rising hospital admissions. But if they fall, and ONS and React data show a fall in prevalence the following week, then we will be able to say that the day with lower cases three weeks earlier was just after the peak, but actually the peak in infections was a week before that. An even bigger challenge is that the rate of increase of infections (the R number) is determined by two things: contact rates and immunity. At any peak of a wave, R = 1. As immunity increases, due to infection and vaccination, R falls. As we change our behaviour and make more contacts, R increases. It’s a balance. There might be enough immunity to keep R below 1 if we are meeting three people per day, but not if we each meet five people every day. If nobody had immunity to Covid-19, and everyone was still socialising at pre-pandemic levels, the R number for the Delta variant would be about 6. Currently it is 1.4. Recent contact surveys suggest that we are having about half the social contact now compared with pre-pandemic levels.
It’s quite likely that we will reach a peak, and that, as behaviours change and social contact increases, we will have another peak to climb. And, again, the delays will matter, because we can’t immediately see the effects of increased socialising on case numbers. If the removal of all restrictions in England on 19 July has a big effect on transmission, we won’t be able to see this until the week beginning 2 August. So in the next couple of months it’s unlikely there will be a rise to a single peak and then a fall. It will be more like going over a range of hills, with many peaks in different places, than it will be climbing a single mountain. The epidemic is going to go up and down in the coming weeks. The number of cases will jump around a lot. It’s only by looking backwards that we can see clearly where we have been. So we will never be able to answer “are we there yet?”. We will only be able to say when we were there. And that might have only been temporary. The consequence of all this is that our individual risk of infection is going to be higher in the coming months than it has been at any point during the pandemic, because the number of infections will likely be higher than at any other point. Vaccinations will prevent many deaths and keep many people out of hospital. But the risks to individuals still exist. If one thing that is clear from all this, it’s the importance of getting vaccinated.

127982,commentisfree/2021/jul/26/government-pandemic-pingdemic-covid-infections,Opinion,England’s 'pingdemic' is a convenient distraction from the real problem | Stephen Reicher,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/26/government-pandemic-pingdemic-covid-infections,"We’re now in the full looking-glass stage of the pandemic, where things seem entirely back to front and solutions are treated as problems. The “ping” of the NHS test-and-trace app has been widely criticised as the cause of disruption for businesses, workers and supply chains. But our problem isn’t a “pingdemic”. A ping simply tells you that you have been in contact with someone who is infected and allows you to do something about it. The problem is the high rate of infection that greatly increases the chances that you will have been in contact with someone who has tested positive – and therefore that you might have Covid too. Right now we are at a point where one in 75 people in England is infected (up from one in 95 the week before) – even without accounting for the government decision to remove almost all measures on 19 July. While there are many factors are involved, meaning we can’t be sure how infection levels will progress, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has blithely accepted that cases could rise to 100,000 a day, while some estimates suggest they could reach 200,000. So, every time you sit on a bus, go to a supermarket or enter a bar, the odds are that someone around you will be carrying the virus. And even though some may now be deleting the app (especially workers who would have to rely on the UK’s paltry sick pay if they had to isolate), almost 27 million of us have downloaded it and are still doing so at a rate of more than 300,000 people per week. So it’s no wonder our towns are now alive with the sound of pinging. The only surprise is that anyone is shocked by what is now happening. In response, the government has concentrated entirely on the consequences of these alerts. It has created a list of exemptions for workers across industries including food, emergency services and medical supplies, who will now not need to self-isolate if they are pinged. In a particularly dystopian turn, staff who are permitted to attend work after being pinged are legally required to self-isolate when they get home. By burying its head in the sand and ignoring the cause of all the alerts, the government is creating a vicious spiral that makes things more dangerous: more exemptions lead to more infections, more infections lead to more pings, more pings lead to further exemptions – and further exemptions lead to a further increase in infections. The only way this approach would make sense is if infections no longer mattered. But they do, in many ways. First, only just over half the population (36.6 million, or 54.9%) are currently fully vaccinated. Nearly half are still unprotected or only partially protected. Second, while the vaccines are effective against serious disease, between 4% and 8% of fully vaccinated people who would previously have been hospitalised after infection still will be. Once there are hundreds of thousands of new infections each day, this will result in a lot of hospitalisations. The third reason is long Covid. There is still much uncertainty around the details of this disease, but it is undoubtedly a real and growing problem. For many people it has been debilitating, and even relatively mild symptoms can severely affect lives, particularly for young people. Cognitive deficits as a result of “brain fog” that lasts a month can still have catastrophic consequences for those who are working or studying for exams, for example. Fourth, as many commentators have already pointed out, letting an infection rip through a population increases the likelihood of new variants emerging that could undermine the protection offered by vaccines – and send us back to square one. England’s strategy is therefore not only a menace to its population, but to the entire world. And finally, if case numbers climb further, the disruption to lives and livelihoods will be huge. We’re already seeing the beginnings of this now. You can only ignore huge numbers of infections for so long. Reality soon catches up, and governments then have to slam on the brakes, imposing restrictions that are far more severe than if they had acted sensibly at the start. That is what happened in the first and second waves. It will probably happen again. There is already talk of reimposing restrictions as summer ends and schools, universities and workplaces become full again. Although the government’s “head in the sand” approach employs the rhetoric of freedom, it actually makes future lockdowns more likely. The obvious alternative is to take infections seriously and enforce measures to drive them down: masks in crowded spaces, maintaining of social distancing where possible, ensuring indoor spaces are well ventilated and supporting people to self-isolate when they need to (all measures, incidentally, that the government may ignore but a clear majority of the public support). This is how you avoid moving backwards towards more draconian restrictions. This is the real “anti-lockdown” strategy. And by dealing with the problem of infections, you also remove the issue of “pinging”. If only the government had moved to address the former with the same alacrity as it has the latter. Indeed, its failure to confront rising infections suggests that all the focus on the “pingdemic” is nothing more than a distraction to divert from the real, underlying issues: the government’s failure to address spiralling infections, and its pursuit of policies that exacerbate this problem. In the end, all the twists, turns, U-turns, complexities and ambiguities about who should or shouldn’t do what when they get “pinged” amount to a great deception – a way of diverting attention from ministers’ failure to do better. For this reason, we should call the situation what it is: a pandemic, not a “pingdemic”.

127994,commentisfree/2021/jul/26/covid-young-people-england-virus-spread-uk,Opinion,Will Covid become a disease of the young? The world is watching England to find out | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/26/covid-young-people-england-virus-spread-uk,"Few issues seem to provoke such a range of opinions among experts as Covid-19 and children. When the WHO-China Joint Mission first reported on the virus in February 2020, one of the nuggets of good news was that children seemed to be relatively unaffected by it. This was surprising; like other acute respiratory infections, coronaviruses usually spread among and infect younger children. China’s strong suppression of the virus meant cases remained extremely low, preventing the virus spreading into other age groups. At the time, Covid appeared to be a disease of elderly and overweight people and those with underlying health conditions. One year into the pandemic, richer countries embarked on a mass vaccination programme to protect not only older age groups but entire adult populations. The success of vaccines in weakening the link between hospitalisations and deaths is clear (although the link is not completely broken). With vaccinated adults now largely protected from the severe consequences of Covid-19, the questions for children have changed. In the UK, there has been a surge of infections among children and adolescents. These will only increase when the school year starts again in the autumn. Is it better for children to catch Sars-CoV-2, as they do the common cold, or is it better to protect them through vaccinations, and measures such as social distancing and face masks? This is the question many countries are now asking. Some may worry about potential side-effects from vaccines, but these are extremely rare and clearly outweighed by the benefits. Fortunately, healthcare regulators in the UK and US have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as safe for use in children between 12 and 15. Already 25% of 12- to 15-year-olds across the US are fully vaccinated, while a third of them have received one dose. Elsewhere, Israel, Italy and France are steaming ahead with vaccinating children in this age group, while Germany gives parents the ability to “opt-in” for the vaccine based on informed consent. The current approach in England seems to be to let teenagers get on with it and see what happens once they’re infected. The result will be an uncontrolled epidemic among younger age groups. Some British scientists aren’t alarmed by this, pointing to other diseases such as seasonal flu, which cause more hospitalisations among children than Covid-19. By contrast, paediatricians in the US argue that exposing children to a new virus with potentially long-term complications is a major risk that should be avoided. Covid-19 was among the top causes of child death in the US in 2020. Though I’m not a paediatrician, I struggle to understand how a disease considered risky to adolescents in the US can be considered innocuous in Britain. Children under 12 are a trickier challenge for scientists and governments. No vaccine has been approved for use in this age group, although the results from early trials are promising. In Israel and the US, health authorities hope that vaccinating enough adults will suppress Covid-19 among children. While this seemed a valid approach against earlier variants, it may prove more difficult with Delta. The Delta variant is more transmissible. It has pushed up the threshold for herd immunity; for this to be achieved, some estimate that as much as 98% of the population would need to be vaccinated. Paediatricians appear split over how dangerous Covid-19 is in younger children, too. Long Covid is a major risk here: recent studies suggest it can cause long-term illness, physiological changes to the body and issues with the heart, kidneys, blood vessels and lungs in children. How common is long Covid in children, and will those who have it get better? Are some children at greater risk than others? Answers to these questions will emerge over time as science progresses, but there is currently no obvious consensus. The prevailing view is that long Covid is a major challenge – but the details are still unclear.
For all countries, schools are the major minefield that lies ahead. It is hard to understate the harms endured by children during the pandemic. Sexual and domestic abuse, child hunger and mental health problems have all risen. The widening education gap will take years to close. Children need to be in school for their social, mental and physical wellbeing. But Delta means children now transmit the virus more than before, meaning clusters are likely to emerge, particularly in secondary schools. There are things that can be done. Improving ventilation can help stop the spread of both Covid-19 and seasonal infections. Current mitigation measures in schools are also far from ideal; weekly lateral flow testing is uncomfortable and voluntary, which has resulted in low uptake. And requiring children to wear masks all day when adults have been told in England they can go to nightclubs without masks seems contradictory and unfair. The alternative of letting the virus spread among young people seems reckless. England is alone in doing this. It is acting as a laboratory for other countries, which are watching to see what happens before they decide on their own policies towards children. The UK government’s comparatively relaxed attitude may also create a petri dish for Covid variants. The consequence could be a new variant that makes our current vaccines less effective, or has more severe outcomes for unvaccinated children. Will Covid become a disease of the young? Will children who suffered under restrictions for 18 months now have to face a wave of infections with unknown consequences? There’s no good path forward until we have approved vaccines for all age groups. Until then, we need to continue to have an open and honest debate about how to put children first, protect their health, education, and general welfare, and listen and learn from other countries discussing this same issue.

That shouldn’t be the question | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/26/mask-question-covid-society-british-state,"England has now entered the strangest phase to date of its Covid experience. Though the health secretary insisted, in a tweet he eventually deleted, that we must not “cower from” the virus, the contradiction between the lifting of restrictions and most epidemiological wisdom sits in the midst of our national life like a dull headache. The same prime minister who promised his ideological soulmates a new dawn of liberty is now embracing vaccine passports, and reportedly facing the prospect of defeat in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, references to “personal responsibility” have brought a new unease to everyday life, as the government reverts to type and does what Tory administrations usually do, transferring risk from the state to individuals. Wearing a mask now feels a bit like putting on a badge. On what the rightwing press rather laughably called “freedom day”, I did some shopping at my local Asda, observed a masked-to-umasked ratio of about 70:30, and sensed – or thought I sensed – the crackle of judgment and mistrust, passing between those who were sticking with face coverings and those who had decided to go without. Two days later, I was in Stoke-on-Trent, where the ratio in a huge Tesco was more like 60:40 in favour of masking up. Despite announcements over the PA advising people to behave as if restrictions were still in place, the fact that some were sticking to the old rules while others were not felt like a matter of dull normality. Only when I spoke to people did something more uneasy reveal itself: an apparent belief that things were now so messed up that whether individuals were taking precautions or not was really not that significant. One woman I met worked in a care home, and said that she was going to carry on wearing a mask in enclosed spaces. But she had no faith that her behaviour, in tandem with vaccinations, was going to play a part in returning us to our pre-Covid state of innocence: “I don’t think we’re ever going to go back to normal,” she said, with a shrug. Meanwhile, the versions of reality presented by the old and new media continue to explode with polarised fury. On the right, a loathing of the state has fused with hostility to vaccines, and everything is tied together by the belief that those who want restrictions to endure are not just killjoys but enemies of freedom. Some on the left, by contrast, have seemed to want restrictions to go on for as long as possible: not just, perhaps, to keep the virus under control but also because life in such conditions has ticked so many of their political and philosophical boxes: a huge expansion of the state, the primacy of “the science”, clear benefits for the environment, and an insistence on collective sacrifice. With all this has come often swingeing judgment of “Covidiots”, and the assumption that going maskless or being sceptical about getting jabbed puts you in the same category as irate callers to talk radio stations and the dreaded Laurence Fox. Somewhere in between these two ideological camps are millions who are too easily forgotten: those for whom lockdowns and stringent restrictions have not been the subject of a gleeful ideological war but a byword for misery and strife. Many of these people have had to leave home every day to work in dangerous circumstances. Some live in overcrowded conditions, and as part of dysfunctional and abusive families. Small business owners have either had their livelihoods shredded or live with the fear they are about to go under; for millions of young people, some of the most basic necessities of life have been put in hold for unbearably long stretches of time, with no sign of concern from the people at the top. In that context, even if some people are simply being irresponsible, I understand why others have quietly delighted in binning their masks, and greeted the end of most restrictions in England with a sigh of relief. A couple of months ago, I was in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham, where I met a twentysomething British-Asian man who talked about his life and the shared experiences of his community before and during the pandemic. He emphasised the state’s neglect of local needs, and his awful experiences at the hands of the police – and went from there to his antipathy to getting jabbed, even though the local Covid death toll had been grim. He was, it seemed, a perfect example of another overlooked part of the population: those who have been sceptical about both restrictions and vaccination, not out of ideological zeal, but because they have an understandably cynical and fearful view of the state and its edicts, and making oneself known to the authorities. Thinking of government as essentially benign and well-intentioned is, perhaps, the preserve of a certain section of the middle class. If you have had any experience of the nastier aspects of policing, the benefits system or this country’s immigration regime, you too might balk at the idea of downloading the official Covid app, dutifully turning up for your injection or registering Covid tests. In large part, this country’s dire experience of Covid-19 is a result of awful government incompetence. But the past 16 months have also shown that societies ridden with inequality and institutional prejudice cannot cope with any convulsive crisis. The basic point is almost banal, but it seems to elude far too many people: if too many are insecure and isolated, and successive governments have made a point of kicking them around, they will either not be able to do what they are told, or treat edicts from the top and disapproval from those living more privileged lives with the utmost cynicism. Given that the worst effects of Covid have been visited on our most marginalised communities, such behaviour may look irrational, but that tension is hardly surprising. There is a very persuasive school of thought that claims Covid will turn out to have been a dress rehearsal for the imminent worsening of the climate emergency. Both crises, after all, require us to follow instructions from the top, move in lockstep and engage in difficult acts of self-sacrifice. As things stand, some people can do those things, but others cannot. The danger is that, as one crisis follows another, amid the individualistic noise generated by social media and politicians happy to speak the language of blame, the noise of swingeing personal judgment will be much louder than any voices pointing out that our social model is now broken beyond repair. Dysfunctional societies usually produce deeply dysfunctional outcomes: until we start to address that basic modern truth, sneering and finger-pointing will only make things immeasurably worse.

128220,commentisfree/2021/jul/25/queen-had-lucky-escape-boris-johnson-sod-it-attitude-to-covid,Opinion,The Queen had a lucky escape from Boris Johnson’s ‘sod it’ attitude to Covid | Andrew Rawnsley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/25/queen-had-lucky-escape-boris-johnson-sod-it-attitude-to-covid,"Right at the beginning of the pandemic, there was intense concern among officials about the health of one elderly female. I was subsequently told by a very senior figure that there was “a lot of worry” the Queen could be killed by Covid, with incalculable effects on public morale and trust in government. The public would ask, so shivered Whitehall, how anyone could be safe if they could not even protect the head of state? This fear was reasonable. We were not far into the crisis before Prince Charles got Covid. While elaborate precautions were put in motion to safeguard the Queen, someone in government did not get the memo. Or he did receive the memo, but couldn’t be arsed to read it. In mid-March of last year, when staff at Number 10 were already falling ill as the virus rampaged around that rabbit-warren building, Boris Johnson told aides that he was going to carry on with his weekly in-person audience with the Queen. He answered protests that this was sensationally reckless by responding: “That’s what I do every Wednesday. Sod this, I’m gonna go and see her.” On the retelling of Dominic Cummings, he had to explain why going to see the Queen was “completely insane” and asked what the prime minister would do if he caused her death. Only then did Mr Johnson finally relent. “He basically just hadn’t thought it through.”
“The day the prime minister threatened to bump off the Queen” is a pretty remarkable story and yet it has not generated headlines as large as might be expected. Perhaps this is because people’s capacity to process information about his bonkers behaviour has reached its saturation point. It may also be because this revelation came in a BBC interview with Mr Cummings, whose testimony is discounted by some or dismissed altogether by others as the bitter effusions of an ex-aide on a revenge quest against a man he describes as “ludicrously” unfit to be prime minister. My view is that you do not have to like Mr Cummings or find his motives unimpeachable to treat him as a useful source of information about how Mr Johnson thinks and operates, especially when being his real self out of public view. Ask yourself: does this story ring true? Is the account of recklessness with the health of the Queen consistent with everything else we know about the prime minister’s approach to dealing with the virus? Has he not displayed a repeated failure to “think things through”? A “sod this” attitude has surely been a consistent theme of the tragically bungled handling of the pandemic, especially when he has been confronted with hard decisions he doesn’t want to face or expert advice that conflicts with his own prejudices or assessments of his personal interests. In the initial phase of this crisis, it was “sod this” to attending meetings of the Cobra emergency committee because he was too busy dealing with his divorce. Then it was “sod this” to agreeing to a timely first lockdown because that involved accepting how serious the situation had become. Last autumn, it was “sod this” to the scientists when they warned that the disease would accelerate wildly out of control if he didn’t impose a second lockdown. And “sod this” to acting in time to save lives because he had made a baseless promise that the nation could revel through a “normal Christmas”. It was also “sod this” to the fatality rate because the data suggested to him that the median age of those claimed by Covid was 82. “That is above life expectancy,” he flippantly declared. “So get Covid and live longer.” He went on to say: “I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff.” That’s something Number 10 can’t deny because it was recorded in WhatsApp messages. Bringing us right up to date, a chorus of voices cautioned against “freedom day” because it was a dangerous gamble to release England from virtually all lockdown restrictions when the number of new cases was going up and a third of the population was still unvaccinated. To those warnings, it was another prime ministerial “sod this”. While the deployment of vaccines has weakened the link between getting the virus and being hospitalised by it, the third wave is taking further lives, will leave more people with debilitating long Covid and is causing severe disruption in critical areas of the economy such as food and fuel supply. Many people have not been “liberated”. They are effectively back in lockdown because they have the virus, fear catching it or have been told to self-isolate. It is such a mess that it even inspired Keir Starmer to produce a rare zinger when he dubbed Mr Johnson “the super-spreader of chaos”. The prime minister, the chancellor, the health secretary and the leader of the opposition are among those who have been forced to self-isolate in recent days. It is symbolic of how distant we still are from normality that Mr Johnson celebrated the second anniversary of his premiership quarantined at Chequers. This episode has been accompanied by another example of his “sod this” style of governing. After Sajid Javid announced he had tested positive for Covid, the prime minister and the chancellor were pinged as close contacts. Number 10 then announced that Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak had been magically selected to participate in a supposedly random “daily testing” pilot scheme that exempted them from self-isolation. They only did a reverse ferret after a furious backlash among MPs and the public, especially the bereaved. Trying to wriggle out of the rules was not idiosyncratic behaviour, but entirely characteristic.
This further undermined government messaging when it was already in a terrific muddle. Tear off your masks. Keep on your masks. Return to the office. Don’t go back to the office. If you’re pinged, it is up to you to decide what you do. If you’re pinged, you must isolate. Be careful. Go clubbing. The explanation for Mr Johnson’s behaviour often offered by his friends is that he is reflexively antagonistic to restrictions because he is an instinctive libertarian. This is a poshed-up way of saying that he loathes rules and has a career history of breaking them. If he were a backbencher rather than prime minister, he would almost certainly be among the anti-lockdowners who depict any sensible precaution as a step towards turning us into East Germany. But his “libertarianism” is too kind an explanation because it overlooks the way he has lurched between chronic prevarication and cavalier impetuousness throughout the pandemic. Another explanation you hear, and this also often comes from people close to him, is that he wants to be loved and hates to disappoint the public. So having promised a “freedom day” he couldn’t bear not to deliver it. Yet most of the general public didn’t want this version of liberation. Polling has been consistent throughout the pandemic. The great majority of voters have faulted the government not for being too draconian about imposing restrictions, but too slack. In terms of his personal approval ratings, the prime minister’s most positive period started at the beginning of this year when he was impelled to pay more heed to scientific advice and act with greater sobriety by the appallingly high death toll of the second wave. A YouGov poll published to coincide with “freedom day” suggested that almost twice as many people believe it wrong to remove nearly all restrictions as think it a good idea.
The “sod this” approach to tackling a deadly virus is not popular. It does, however, satisfy the appetite of a minority strand of opinion that is disproportionately influential over this prime minister. Hostility to restrictions has been noisily proclaimed by a faction of Tory MPs and their allies in the rightwing press. Many well-placed sources agree that their ferocious opposition to a pre-emptive “circuit-breaker” lockdown last autumn exerted a grip as powerful as it was baleful on the prime minister. Had he not gone ahead with the “freedom day” for which they had clamoured, Mr Johnson feared a monstering at the hands of the rightwing media and a big revolt by Tory MPs, a chunk of whom turned up in the chamber of the Commons ostentatiously refusing to wear masks. On Mr Cummings’ account, the prime minister regards the Daily Telegraph, for which he once wrote a highly remunerative column, as “my real boss”. That puts everyone else in their place. It is to this minority faction of opinion, not to parliament or the public, that he sees himself as answerable. Few can claim to have got everything right about this pandemic, but none has been more consistently wrong than the threat-deniers, lockdown-haters, mask-defiers and let-it-rippers. Yet this is the one group to whom the prime minister is never capable of saying “sod this”. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",2021-07-25 07:30:45+00:00,128221,67
128356,commentisfree/2021/jul/24/vaccine-passports-rights-freedoms-covid,Opinion,It's time for a serious debate about vaccine passports | Shami Chakrabarti,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/24/vaccine-passports-rights-freedoms-covid,"For the second time in my adult life, I feel we must have a national conversation about domestic compulsory ID. Last time, in the mid-00s, it was an authoritarian solution looking for a problem to fix, with immigration, benefit fraud and everything but climate change proffered as justification. This time the problem posed by the government’s catastrophic “economy first” approach to pandemic management is all too clear. Still, the introduction of an internal passport will be just as costly, divisive and counterproductive as before – and even more dangerous to any way of life worth fighting for beyond this terrible time. Many people will have watched the government flip-flopping over whether some kind of public or commercially sourced proof of vaccination status should be required before access to a whole host of everyday activities from attending a nightclub or sports event to a trip to the pub or the shops. There have been similarly mixed messages about whether the introduction of such a regime should be left to businesses to decide on and regulate for themselves. I’m becoming less and less convinced that this constant oscillation marks a mere lack of competence rather than a more malevolent and studied chaos aimed at passing the buck for any further deaths from what international experts call Boris Johnson’s “unethical experiment”. This approach, Herd Immunity 2.0, lets the virus surge, creating fertile territory for vaccine-resistant variants. To be fair, government spokespeople are increasingly brazen about their threat of compulsory ID – an illiberal and discriminatory measure – being a means to force young people to get vaccinated rather than to effectively prevent transmission.
Compulsory vaccination is counterproductive in nations with liberal and libertarian traditions and is unethical given the newness of these vaccines and the paucity of public education or supportive incentives. Necessary social distancing has been particularly cruel to young and older people. Older people arguably had a very direct personal incentive to vaccinate. Why not offer youngsters and everyone in poorly paid and insecure work fully paid time off to recover from any side-effects of taking the jabs? So what about Labour? With the possibility of a rebellion on the government benches, there has understandably been some interest in what position the opposition might take. It seems the line is currently against vaccination passports as “costly, open to fraud and impractical”. Yet the same spokesperson says that “testing for access to venues would be more efficient, and would give people and business more certainty”. Let’s unpack that shall we? How is proof of a test less costly or open to fraud than proof of vaccination itself? Further, lateral flow tests are notoriously unreliable. And does our summer of sport suggest that stewards on zero-hours contracts and the minimum wage should be relied upon to interrogate the detail of someone’s daily testing status rather than wave them through for a quieter life? We will not speak of Wembley. Potential super-spreader events are either safe to go ahead or not. That calculation is about our general state of transmission, the health in the community and the capacity of the NHS to cope – not the compromised decisions of outsourced bouncers-turned-Covid cops. I could rehearse the arguments about racism, sexual harassment and all the other ways in which domestic pass laws of any kind will inevitably lead to discrimination, corruption and oppression. I will only say that as this new kind of compulsory ID is explicitly about health data, it crosses a further line into personal privacy as well as liberty. It has always been clear to me that there are instinctive liberals and authoritarians on both sides of a left-right political spectrum that is traditionally defined around tax and spend. Yet during our war on Covid, the underlying debates around rights and freedoms come into sharper focus, testing us all. Domestic Covid passports are part of a strategy of smoke and mirrors for a government that would like to believe that “personal responsibility” can substitute for sound and ethical public health policy during a pandemic that has already cost the UK nearly double the civilian fatalities of the second world war. This is no time for triangulation or political games. This is high time for an honest debate about how we protect each other as a community, and how soon we should be unlocked together in the safest manner, without making those vulnerable on grounds of race, age or economic insecurity pay for so-called “freedom day”.

We must listen to locals’ solutions | Peter Malouf,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/31/covid-is-running-riot-in-aboriginal-communities-we-must-listen-to-locals-solutions,"Where is the light at the end of the tunnel of the Covid-19 outbreak in New South Wales? There will be some restrictions easing when 70% of the NSW population is fully vaccinated, but there is a significant vaccination gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. Aboriginal communities in NSW have been experiencing an alarming rise in the number of active cases. The Covid vaccines, described as 95% effective, were thought to be NSW’s way out of the outbreak. Now, we struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Aboriginal communities in NSW navigated the first wave of the pandemic with relatively few active Covid cases. However, since this winter, we have had many more cases, most of them in western Sydney and western NSW.
The statistics are stark and shocking. With increasing Covid-19 cases in Aboriginal communities in western and far western NSW in the last week, Aboriginal community-controlled health services within the region pointed out that more Covid vaccine doses are needed to deliver their upscaled vaccination programs such as mobile clinics and drive-throughs. The level of vaccines has not been increased, which is disappointing, to say the least. Consequently, rural and remote Aboriginal communities in NSW are left unvaccinated during a surge of active cases within the region. Aboriginal communities’ rurality makes them more vulnerable to infectious diseases than other communities in NSW. Longstanding socioeconomic inequities in the regions include limited access to healthcare, higher rates of chronic conditions, economic barriers, geographic isolation, poor housing conditions and limited or no access to clean water. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation’s target of vaccinating 100% of the Aboriginal population before we open up is unlikely to be met, given the lack of resources and vaccine doses supplied to rural and remote communities. Western and far western NSW regions face a transmissible Delta variant running riot in Aboriginal communities and are crippled by infrastructure gaps that aggravate the outbreak. The lack of adequate infrastructure in Aboriginal communities – and issues associated with its maintenance – hinders responses to the outbreak and can prevent people from complying with public health orders (such as physical distancing, self-isolation and hand washing).

The public health infrastructure in rural and remote NSW is not well understood but is potentially the most fragile. There is an acute shortage of personnel and services in many rural and remote settings. There is also a tendency for policies to be predominantly city-centric, which is now impacting Aboriginal people in rural and remote settings in addressing the Covid-19 outbreak. Our Aboriginal community-controlled health services are crucial to the public health response in the western and far west region. They can deliver high-quality healthcare and can coordinate upscaled immunisation programs such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. With this crisis, we need the government to recognise ACCHOS and invest in them to deliver upscale vaccination models and take local leadership in coordinating the public health response.
Aboriginal communities urgently need the government to listen to locals’ solutions to the current outbreak. Many Aboriginal communities are taking action by using traditional knowledge and practices such as voluntary isolation, sealing off their own homes and communities, and preventive measures in their languages. Community members are also doing welfare checks and coordinating food hampers for families and individuals. To see light at the end of the tunnel, we need Aboriginal communities to be the beacon of the public health response. • Dr Peter Malouf is a Wakka Wakka and Wuli Wuli man, who is the executive director of the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW and adjunct associate professor at Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney",2021-08-31 06:57:51+00:00,128959,2
129243,commentisfree/2021/aug/29/pandemic-poorer-countries-vaccines-covid,Opinion,"For most of the world, the pandemic is not over | Devi Sridhar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/29/pandemic-poorer-countries-vaccines-covid,"The Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 is causing major problems across the world. Estimated to be at least twice as transmissible as the original virus, it is challenging the measures that governments took in 2020. Thailand and South Korea are seeing accelerating cases and deaths, after having successfully managed their epidemics last year. New Zealand and Australia find themselves in snap lockdowns. Low- and middle-income countries are struggling to keep their hospitals from collapsing. Delta has changed the game radically: it is almost like managing a whole new virus. Though, while much of the world struggles, life seems almost normal in Britain. London nightclubs are full of those partying and enjoying themselves without a care in the world. Festivals are going ahead with tens of thousands of revellers. After incessant daily media coverage, Covid-19 has fallen off the front pages, receding into the background. Observing this, it feels as if the pandemic is over for most people.
The game-changer in Britain has been vaccination. When the first vaccine trial results were reported, the efficacy was much higher than anyone expected. And early studies from Scotland indicated that the Pfizer vaccine was even effective at stopping transmission. This gave real hope for using a vaccine to suppress the virus or reach a “herd immunity” threshold at which it would stop circulating. It’s true that Delta changed the picture again. While vaccines are still incredibly effective at stopping severe illness and deaths, those who are double vaccinated can still be infected with Delta and transmit it to others. But the important metric is case-conversion: the number of Covid cases in the community that translate into hospital admissions. When the virus first emerged in China, the estimates were around 20%. Wider testing for asymptomatic cases brought this down to about 13%, and vaccines have managed to bring this down even further to 3-4%. Yet these problems pale in comparison to the devastation in countries such as Indonesia, India, Nepal, Peru and Brazil. Hospitals have collapsed in several regions, with beds only becoming available if someone dies, and oxygen shortages are causing usually preventable deaths even in younger people. In June, 30 patients in an intensive care unit in Uganda were reported to have died on one night, as oxygen supplies ran out. Thousands of people have died at home, with teams of civilian volunteers formed to help take away their bodies and support the families of those who have died. What can be done to help and support these countries? In the short term, getting medical capacity such as skilled staff, oxygen, ventilators and more beds into countries is vital. In addition, institutions such as the World Bank have been supporting countries financially to implement lockdown measures with economic support for those who can’t work. But these are again short-term measures, given that Delta will keep spreading. The larger issue is that these countries need more vaccines to be able to protect their health and social workers first, then their elderly and vulnerable groups, and finally move towards broad-scale protection of their populations. Basically, they need to replicate what the UK has done but in a context of billions of people, not millions. And they need to do this in the face of a fast-moving virus that is causing devastation by the day. The main bottleneck to achieving that right now is in the supply chain. The solution proposed by rich countries and pharmaceutical companies is a donation mechanism: rich countries pledged money and doses to an international initiative, Covax, which then distributed these across the world. Alternatively rich countries could directly donate doses to their country of choice.
As is widely recognised, this charity model has failed. Under scarcity, rich countries kept their doses and didn’t share. This is being repeated now with the decision to give booster doses (third doses) in rich countries, while poorer countries are still waiting for first jabs. And it’s not surprising – whether with previous epidemics of Ebola or swine flu, rich countries always take care of themselves first, and then turn to the rest of the world. What does this mean looking forward? It means we need to move away from the charity model towards one where regions can produce enough supply for their own populations, ideally from local manufacturing hubs. This means setting up factories in strategic locations across the world, doing the required tech transfer and human capacity investments, and being prepared to pass emergency intellectual property waivers so that manufacturing can happen without the normal patent protection. The World Bank, and richer countries, should be helping these countries to become self-sustainable, instead of remaining in the 20th-century dependency model. As we look to the rest of 2021, what is emerging is a tale of two pandemics. Rich countries are storming ahead, trying to pretend the pandemic is over. Poor countries are being forgotten, yet again, and are struggling to see how they can emerge from this year without continual loss of life and deeper devastation.

129337,commentisfree/2021/aug/29/the-rich-nations-take-on-the-world-post-pandemic-im-all-right-jack,Opinion,"The rich nations’ take on the world post-pandemic? ‘I’m all right, Jack’ | Kenan Malik",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/29/the-rich-nations-take-on-the-world-post-pandemic-im-all-right-jack,"Rich countries have administered more doses of Covid vaccine than the size of their populations – an average of 105 doses per 100 people. In low-income countries, that figure is just two per 100 people. It is a disparity that is likely to define the post-pandemic world. There has been much discussion about the inequalities that Covid has exposed both within nations and between them. Paradoxically, though, it is now that we are beginning to get the virus under control that inequalities may become most exposed. There is little possibility that the virus will be eradicated. Rather, it is likely to become endemic but contained in most western nations. The efficacy of vaccines will enable people in richer countries to “live with the virus”. Not so in poorer nations. The 30 poorest countries in the world, with a combined population of almost a billion, have vaccinated on average barely 2% of their population. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo the figure is 0.1%, in Haiti 0.24%, in Chad 0.27%, in Tanzania 0.36%. “Living with the virus” will mean something very different in such countries than it will in the west.
Policies pursued by rich countries will make it even more difficult for poorer nations to live with the virus. By the end of this year, the G7 club of the world’s biggest economies will have stockpiled almost 1bn spare doses of Covid vaccines; Britain alone has more than 200m. That G7 stockpile would be more than sufficient to vaccinate the entire adult population of sub-Saharan Africa. The irony is that many poor countries show low levels of vaccine hesitancy, but have no supplies for communities eager for inoculation, whereas in many of the countries hoarding the stuff, more people are sceptical about the vaccine. The evidence, one of the authors of a study on global vaccine hesitancy observes, is that “prioritising vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunisation coverage”. Yet, in a system in which vaccines are distributed according to how deep your pockets are, logic and need have little sway. The story of Covax lays bare the problem of global inequity. Organised jointly by the World Health Organization, GAVI, a campaign to increase access to immunisation in poor countries, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Covax aims for a fairer global distribution by allocating vaccines to 92 low- and middle-income countries. It has so far delivered less than 10% of the 2bn doses promised. One reason for the shortfall is that richer countries have been able to elbow Covax out of the vaccine marketplace, making it difficult to obtain sufficient doses. Absurdly, having pushed Covax aside to get to the front of the vaccine queue, many rich countries have subsequently bought vaccines for themselves through the scheme, despite its diminished stock. Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have all acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of Covax vaccines. It’s scandalously selfish, but barely acknowledged. Until recently, except for one or two hotspots, African nations have had relatively low numbers of infections and deaths, though that may reflect poor data collection rather than the reality of Covid on the continent. Now, though, things are changing rapidly. Even as the Delta variant has been largely brought under control in Europe, vaccination weakening the link between infections, illness and hospitalisation, it is ripping through much of sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of the British population are double-jabbed. Nevertheless, some hospitals are facing considerable pressure. So imagine what it must be like in a country such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Tanzania, in which fewer than half of 1% of the population are vaccinated, and in which the health infrastructure was barely functioning even before the pandemic. To add to the pressure, Covid has reduced the capacity of such countries to deal with other endemic diseases. One study suggested that deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis and malaria could, over the next five years, increase by 10%, 20% and 36% respectively, compared with what might have been the case without the Covid crisis.
Beyond the immediate impact on health services lies the longer-term impact on post-pandemic economic recovery. The IMF has warned of “a worsening two-track recovery, driven by dramatic differences in vaccine availability”. Not only will the poor suffer from Covid, they will suffer even more from slowness of recovery from Covid. Perhaps most insidiously, Covid policies are likely to reinforce the physical segregation of the world. Already, rich nations live as if in gated communities, within Fortress Europe, Fortress Britain, Fortress Australia, all designed to keep out those from poorer nations, whether migrants or refugees. “Offshoring” – the insistence that irregular migrants and asylum seekers should be processed not in the place of arrival but in a third country – is now common practice in the west. The US is treating even Afghan refugees in this fashion.
In the post-pandemic world, defined by vaccine passports and quarantines, such policies will become more entrenched still. Last week, Greek police fined irregular migrants €5,000 the moment they stepped off their boats for failing to have taken a Covid test before arrival. It was an absurd move, designed more to frighten and humiliate than to enforce Covid policy. After an outcry, the police backtracked. Nevertheless, it provided a glimpse of the coming world, in which fears of Covid may become a further excuse to enforce harsh, discriminatory immigration policies. From TB to Aids, there is a long history of the authorities using anxieties about disease as a form of immigration control to keep out the unwelcome. In a world segregated between the vaccinated rich and the unvaccinated poor, many non-western countries may find themselves on a “red list” in more ways than one. There are reasons of self-interest, too, for trying to ensure global vaccination. Large unvaccinated populations create greater scope for new variants to emerge, variants that might render existing vaccines less effective, and so leave even inoculated populations more vulnerable. Selfishness is not just harmful to other people, it may not even be in one’s own self-interest. Inequality helped define the pandemic. It is likely to define even more the post-pandemic world. And it will do so because of deliberate “I’m all right, Jack” decisions taken by politicians in the rich world. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",2021-08-29 06:00:09+00:00,129338,2
129583,commentisfree/2021/aug/27/us-report-covid-origins-pandemic-virus-covid,Opinion,The US report into Covid’s origins is little use in averting another pandemic | Laura Spinney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/27/us-report-covid-origins-pandemic-virus-covid,"US intelligence services have just briefed the president, Joe Biden, on the results of their 90-day investigation into the origins of Covid-19. They were asked to test two hypotheses: that it had a “natural” origin, or that it escaped from a lab. Preliminary reports suggest that their findings are inconclusive. Few scientists will be surprised by this, and yet the investigation has been the subject of intense – and intensely divisive – political and media interest over the past three months. The White House has promised more detail, which could be illuminating, especially if it reveals the genetic sequences of viruses related to the one that causes Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2, that were being studied in labs in Wuhan in 2019. But that won’t change the fact that two investigations down, we’re still in the dark as to how this pandemic started. Biden ordered the latest investigation partly because of widespread dissatisfaction with one set up by the World Health Organization (WHO), which reported in March that a lab origin was “extremely unlikely”. Many saw the WHO’s efforts as compromised because China used its influence within the organisation to set restrictive terms of reference. It’s hard to see why the new investigation, from a single nation locked in a trade war with China, and from intelligence services to boot – not a source often lauded for transparency – should be accorded any more credibility. It should have been conducted by a coalition of national science academies. They still might not have reached any firm conclusions, but they would have had more chance of being seen as independent. The WHO is promising a new investigation, and there may be others. Whether these will add anything is again questionable, but it’s important that scientists continue to try to get at the truth, and that we all acknowledge that it might take them years to do so. It’s difficult to trace the origins of a pandemic. Here’s just one example of the challenges. Much has been made of the finding that some Italians may have been carrying antibodies to Sars-CoV-2 as early as September 2019, several months before the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in China. (Nobody’s suggesting the pandemic started in Italy, only that it might have come out of China earlier than thought.) But if those antibodies really were to Sars-CoV-2 – which some researchers doubt – it’s odd that the wave of Covid-19 infection they indicate wasn’t followed by a wave of hospitalisations and deaths, as it was later in China. What’s more, those antibody carriers didn’t go to the doctor with Covid symptoms, they went for other reasons. If the earliest Chinese cases were also mild or asymptomatic, how will researchers find them? To be clear, the only reason these investigations are valuable is scientific – because the knowledge they provide could help prevent something similar from happening again. Even if it could be proved to many people’s satisfaction that a lab accident triggered the pandemic, it’s unlikely that any punishment could be meted out or compensation demanded. As Thomas Bollyky and Yanzhong Huang of the US Council on Foreign Relations have written, a lab accident is not a violation of any international law, and even if it were, establishing causation would be tricky. As they point out, taking the US perspective: “Many nations faced similar challenges in this pandemic and did not suffer the United States’ poor health outcomes.” The ongoing debate over Covid’s origins has had good and bad outcomes. A good outcome is that it has shone a spotlight on the fact that, as biosecurity experts Filippa Lentzos and Gregory Koblentz reported in May, labs authorised to deal with the most dangerous pathogens have been proliferating in an almost complete vacuum of regulation or oversight. One component of the oversight that should now be put in place is independent, international inspection teams. A model already exists for these, in the WHO’s protocol for overseeing the two labs – one Russian, one American – that hold the last stockpiles of variola virus, which causes the now eradicated disease smallpox. A bad outcome is that at least part of the scientific community – supposedly the bulwark that protects us from propaganda – has bought into the false dichotomy of two “rival” hypotheses for Covid’s origins. It’s as if they were looking at one of those ambiguous images, and seeing either a duck or a rabbit when both are in the picture. In reality it isn’t natural origins versus lab leak; it’s long-term human activity versus short-term human activity. Natural ceases to mean much in this context.
In fact, since the evidence is by now overwhelming that long-term human activity is accelerating the emergence of novel pathogens and increasing the risk of pandemics, the question investigators should really be asking is: did some recent, one-off event such as a lab accident exacerbate the already high and growing risk of spillover of a virus with pandemic potential caused by a decades-long shift towards industrialised farming and the wildlife trade? Through their reliance on antibiotics, livestock monocultures and crowding, industrial-scale farms are ratcheting up the virulence of animal pathogens that the wildlife trade – and one of its shop windows, wet markets – is bringing into contact with potential host species they wouldn’t otherwise encounter, including us. This is not news. As the journalist Felicity Lawrence wrote in 2009, during the swine flu pandemic: “Novel human disease is the toxic debt of today’s industrial livestock farming.” Here’s something worth reflecting on: in recent decades, most spillover events of highly pathogenic avian influenza – still considered the disease most likely to cause a future pandemic – occurred in countries with generally good biosecurity but lots of intensive poultry farming. The reason more of them didn’t seed outbreaks is that they were nipped in the bud through good disease surveillance – the US being a leader in this. If high-security labs are enjoying a boom, prestige and biowarfare deterrence may have something to do with it, but it’s also because dangerous pathogens are booming. The false dichotomy that has been set up over Covid’s origins is hard to challenge. Until a year ago, scientists who collaborated across national and disciplinary borders were applauded. Now they’re accused of conflicts of interest – meaning that many of the people who know most about what happened, or are best qualified to find out, have been silenced. Meanwhile the behemoth that is the global livestock industry goes about its toxic business untroubled by any real scrutiny. This week, Marco Marani of the University of Padova in Italy and colleagues reported that the probability of an individual experiencing a Covid-like pandemic in their lifetime, currently about 38%, could double within a few decades. Unless scientists stand back and look at the bigger picture, it won’t stop there.

During an exasperated intervention earlier this week, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that of 4.8bn Covid vaccine doses delivered around the world to date, around 75% have gone to just 10 countries. The level of vaccine donations from richer countries, he added with some understatement, has been “really disappointing”. In Africa, where a third wave of the virus has been on the march since May, less than 2% of the continent’s population has received a first dose. While high-income countries across the globe have administered around 100 doses for every 100 citizens, the equivalent figure for low-income countries is 1.5. As a consequence, while the United States, Britain and other richer nations begin to roll out programmes for booster shots in the autumn, a pandemic of the unvaccinated continues unabated elsewhere. The WHO’s target of reaching 10% of the population of every country with a first shot by the end of September is unlikely to be met. This grotesque inequity, as Dr Tedros and others have repeatedly pointed out, is ultimately in no one’s interest. Allowing much of the planet to operate as a variant factory, and the more transmissible Delta variant to run riot, stores up trouble for the future. “Vaccinating the world” should therefore be seen as sound strategy as well as an ethical obligation. But, in Europe and North America, early good intentions have so far come a distant second to domestic priorities. Governments with the means to do so have secured preferential deals for vaccines, over-ordered doses, hoarded them and restricted exports. Britain has played a leading role in opposing calls for intellectual property rights for vaccines to be temporarily waived. Overall, donations from richer countries have not remotely approached the level required. Covax, the vaccine-pooling scheme, has under-delivered, losing its major supply source after India’s decision to ban AstraZeneca exports. On the ground, insufficient time, effort and finance have been devoted to ensuring that the infrastructure is in place to carry out vaccination programmes efficiently, when doses are available. The likely result is that most people in low-income countries will be required to wait until 2023 to be vaccinated. This desperately slow rollout will cost the global economy $2.3tn in lost output, according to a study published today. The brunt of those losses will be borne by the unvaccinated poor. Perhaps more in hope than expectation, the WHO has called for a two-month moratorium on the administering of booster shots in wealthier nations. The politics of such a move would be fraught. But a way must be found to dramatically increase supply to those countries struggling to provide first and second jabs. As the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization have acknowledged by setting up a joint vaccine taskforce, the level of inequality is untenable. As successive waves of Covid-19 hit richer countries, domestic crisis management eclipsed all other considerations. But if the world is to emerge sustainably from the pandemic, a more strategic and equitable approach is desperately needed. • This article was amended on 27 August 2021.

On Saturday, I was alarmed at the increase in numbers in NSW – 825 new cases, the highest number of cases recorded in any state since the pandemic began. Listening to Gladys Berejiklian speak, the recurring message, as it should be, was to get vaccinated. My mother and father have had both shots of the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine. In the front room of our house sits my grandmother watching the press conference alone as we are currently isolating from her. Thankfully she is also fully vaccinated. However, my three younger sisters and I are not vaccinated; at the age of 14 it is not an option for me.
It’s scary for my family and many other families with children when we look to the future. What the premier has outlined is that if vaccination rates hit 70% to 80%, NSW could start to open up. But will that take children such as myself into account? With the Delta strain infecting many children and even causing hospitalisations and death among adolescents and young people, how will young people be safe? According to figures from the federal Department of Health, more than 6,200 children in Australia have been infected with Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. On Tuesday it was announced that all 16-39-year-olds in Victoria will be eligible for Pfizer. For children aged 12 to 15 it has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. In France, Italy, Canada and elsewhere in the world, children of this age are being vaccinated. If it’s safe, why can’t we be vaccinated yet? Young people like myself are becoming extremely frustrated at the fact that we’re often left out of this conversation and that our questions are unanswered. I live in a hotspot LGA. The majority of students at my school and most of my family live in western Sydney where case numbers are sky high. Anxiety and fear is rising among us, particularly in the younger demographic. With the prospect of opening up and returning to face-to-face learning eventually, will we be safe? In a household with four young children, our family’s conversations surrounding post-lockdown plans are plagued with question marks. If we open up but aren’t vaccinated, we are at a higher risk of being infected with Covid-19 and could potentially end up in hospital, spread the virus or even suffer from long Covid. Vaccination of children is a difficult area. How will consent work with those aged 12 to 15? Some of my relatives are vaccine hesitant and some are even anti-vaxxers. While my family might roll our eyes, their concerns could certainly act as a barrier to vaccination among the young. What would occur in situations where parents are anti-vaccination but their child wants to receive the vaccine? Could children under 16 consent to being vaccinated? These days I’m feeling overwhelmed, angry and confused about so many issues: the government (both federal and state) and their mixed messaging and failure to admit their mistakes. Anti-vaxxers and their selfish protests. The lack of answers and no end to any of this in sight.
What I, and other young people want, is to feel safe and informed. We need to be given the vaccine or, at the very least, we need to know when we will have access to the vaccine. We need to be addressed as young adults. We need answers to our many questions. What does the research say on vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds? When will life return to normal for us young adults? Will we be able to get vaccinated before we go back to school? Of course, it’s maybe naive to be angry at the lack of answers in such unprecedented and confusing times. We know there is no rule book or guide to this pandemic. However, it’s the contradictions and lack of transparency that really infuriates me. When Berejiklian makes obscure claims such as “Depending on the case numbers, life will be much freer than what it is today and that’s the point I want to make”, there is no clarity, no details, no plan. Only the vague promise of a “freer future”. Recently I watched an interview with Prof Mary-Louise McLaws regarding young people and Covid. She suggested that parents who are concerned about their children’s health should write a letter to their local MP. It seems the only option we have left is to advocate for young adults to be vaccinated. I’m 14 and I want the vaccine. Many young people I know do too. Before we open up, we must consider this young demographic that is nearly 20% of the Australian population. • Anhaar Kareem is a 14-year-old student in year 9 at Al Noori Muslim school in Sydney’s west",2021-08-24 04:21:56+00:00,130332,2
130432,commentisfree/2021/aug/23/doctor-tories-hospitals-boris-johnson-sajid-javid,Opinion,"For a doctor, the Tories’ empty promises on hospitals are soul-destroying | Rachel Clarke",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/doctor-tories-hospitals-boris-johnson-sajid-javid,"In my first year as a doctor, I witnessed the fetid reality of crumbling NHS real estate. Arriving at work one morning on the emergency assessment unit – the frenetic hub through which most of the hospital’s acutely unwell patients passed – I discovered it had ground to a malodorous halt. Men in hard hats were shouting orders to nurses, porters were evacuating patients on trolleys. I was told a main waste pipe on the floor above had ruptured, with predictably rancid and unhygienic consequences. So much for being an NHS teaching hospital of global renown: we were literally awash with slurry. I was reminded of these unsavoury events by Sajid Javid, who tweeted last week: “Looking forward to opening one of new 48 hospitals [sic] later today.” Imagine bragging about building all those new hospitals when the existing ones are so rundown and dilapidated, they can’t even contain their human excrement. Javid’s tweet met with a chorus of derision. The fact was, the health secretary was not en route to a “new” hospital at all, but rather to a new cancer unit, built within the existing Cumberland Infirmary in Cumbria, which was itself opened in 2000 – by the then prime minister, Tony Blair. As Siva Anandaciva, chief policy analyst at health think tank the King’s Fund, puts it, the phrase new hospital “might suggest the NHS will see its stock of hospitals grow with … brand new, fully staffed hospitals that offer a full range of services. But – in reality – the promised investment is likely to pay for new facilities on existing hospital sites and the redeployment of existing staff.” I shared the public fury. For what, precisely, is wrong with simply telling the truth and saying you are delighted to be opening a new cancer unit? Why devalue all the effort, hard work and rightful pride among its staff by pretending it is an actual hospital? I don’t lie to my patients. So why does the health secretary think he is exempt from the NHS’s duty of candour, lying to NHS staff, patients and voters alike? Needless to say, these questions are rhetorical. From the moment Boris Johnson became prime minister, he has sought to convince voters of his compassion and decency through outlandish promises to build scores of shiny new NHS hospitals. First, in August 2019, he pledged an “extra” £1.8bn to help rebuild the NHS’s tattered real estate, although £1bn of that was immediately exposed as not being new money at all. Moreover, as experts were quick to point out, the figure was a drop in the ocean after the havoc wreaked on NHS infrastructure by a decade of austerity underfunding. Johnson learned from the criticism. Size, he realised, was everything. By the 2019 Conservative party conference, the “new” money had ballooned to £3bn, and, by the end of the year, he fought the general election on a manifesto pledge to build and fund “40 new hospitals” over the next decade. Journalists swiftly observed that in fact only six upgrades of existing hospitals had actual funds committed, and the number of funded “new” hospitals amounted to precisely zero. Instead, various NHS trusts would share a mere £100m of “seed money” to help them draw up plans – paper plans – for 34 future projects. No matter that the numbers didn’t add up. Like “Get Brexit done”, “40 new hospitals” was another headline-grabbing, three-word soundbite. Johnson has duly repeated it ad nauseum. By October last year, like Pinocchio’s nose, the numbers had grown again. This time a staggering 48 new hospitals were promised, or, as Johnson put it: “the biggest hospital building programme in a generation”. You can unravel that claim on the back of an envelope. With a new-build hospital costing around £500m, 48 of them would clearly require £24bn and not the £3.7bn promised by Johnson. The numbers simply don’t add up. Why does this matter so much? Well, in case the new health secretary hasn’t noticed, NHS staff are feeling pretty battered after 18 months of Covid. In pretending he was opening a “new” hospital, Javid diminished the efforts of staff locally who broke their backs to get a new cancer centre commissioned and operational against the backdrop of a global pandemic. That is disrespectful as well as dishonest. It treats NHS staff as fools. Even more importantly for patients, there is the direct impact on patient safety of neglected, decaying NHS infrastructure. In the same week that Javid faked his “new” hospital visit, several NHS hospitals in England warned of being at risk of catastrophic roof collapse, with building materials having reached the end of their lifespan more than a decade ago. The government’s failure adequately to maintain our hospitals means operating theatres that have to be closed when it rains too hard. Downpours that trigger electrical faults in vital machinery keeping patients alive. MRI scanners that end up unused because inadequate servicing has led to avoidable malfunctions. Most fundamental of all, when a government insists, effectively, that two plus two equals five, it trashes public trust in politics. The hallmark of Johnson’s approach to the NHS – ever more grandiose promises, ever more unhinged from reality – are, for this doctor, soul-destroying.

But if the weekend’s angry anti-lockdown protests reflected genuine pain in the community, they also showed how, in a complicated international emergency, rightwing grifters have seized an opportunity.

The hustle comes, most obviously, from rightward-moving “wellness” advocates, people long accustomed to merging conspiracism and commerce. In the recent years, Qanon has spread like a disease through the New Age milieu, so that “natural health” entrepreneurs who once might have hailed the Dawning of Aquarius now rail with equal fervour against George Soros and the Great Reset. But the distinctive character of the so-called freedom movement also reflects a broader evolution of conservatism, a political philosophy degenerating into an overt racket. In a now classic essay for the Baffler, Rick Perlstein traces the sensibility of the modern right back to the direct mail fundraisers of the 1960s, who recognised the financial potential of the paranoic style after Barry Goldwater’s presidential nomination. They found they could generate huge revenue for conservative clients using “robotype” machines to target the believers of the far right with lurid warnings about communist plots, UN takeovers and the persecution of Christians, calamities that could, apparently, be averted by means of a small donation. The technology of solicitation improved, the mailing lists grew longer, and the money rolled in. In 1992, far-right firebrand Pat Buchanan famously addressed the Republican National Convention, telling delegates they were embroiled in a titanic struggle. “It is,” he said, “a cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the cold war itself. For this war is for the soul of America.” The speech marked a fresh strategy for Republicans, one in which lachrymose appeals to conservative values would win back those voters dismayed by neoliberal economics. “We need to let them know we know how bad they’re hurting,” Buchanan explained. “They don’t expect miracles of us, but they need to know we care.” Culture war injected the techniques of mail-order solicitation (where miracles and performative empathy had long coexisted) deep into the veins of the mainstream right. The money game and the political game became, Perlstein argues, two facets of the one operation, as evidenced by pitches “in which the ideological and transactional share the exact same vocabulary, moral claims and cast of heroes and villains.”
Consider channels such as Alex Jones’s Infowars, where the presentations of apocalyptic conspiracies segue seamlessly into plugs for Infowars Life Brain Force Plus, Infowars Life Super Male Vitality, Infowars Live Liver Shield and an array of similar potations. The more mainstream Fox News might not market its own branded snake oil but it employs the same methods, convincing befuddled boomers that only Tucker Carlson stands between them and the New Black Panthers, and then selling advertisers access to a loyal audience of terrified suburbanites. At some level, the neoliberal turn made us all into entrepreneurs. These days, progressive activists tout podcasts, too. But because the right openly extolls capitalism, it’s far more suited to the monetisation of everything, as the emergence of Donald J Trump – a Brain Force president – proved. In 2016, the Republicans showed they could eventually unite behind a candidate who made no distinction at all between his business and political interests. In a sense, the American right got the leader it deserved: as Paul Waldman says, Trump’s presidency revealed that “so many people at so many levels within the Republican Party [were] grifters, lunatics, or both.”
All over the world, conservatives took note. After Trumpism, every far-right conspiracist sees himself as an entrepreneur on the rise, one controversy away from establishing his own Infowars or Breitbart. It’s not just the fringe, either. In the past, ambitious young conservatives might have joined the Liberal party, assiduously lobbied for preselection and then toiled anonymously for decades on the backbench, hoping one day to earn Cabinet positions. Today, such people can abandon Bob Menzies for PT Barnum, build their followers on YouTube or Facebook, and land sweet gigs on Sky News. There’s no real downside. In 2021, rightwing media personalities exert more influence than most MPs. Better still, the new pundits feel no responsibility for anything. Why would they? Their success depends not on providing solutions but on ginning up, by any means necessary, the conservative base. The hallucinatory culture war they deploy probably can’t deliver electoral majorities. But that doesn’t matter. It reliably generates the online engagement on which media monetisation relies. The Covid crisis suits such hucksters down to the ground. As a medical emergency foregrounding scientific expertise, it enables them to re-use all the old tropes from climate denialism. They can tout quack cures, mock vaccinations, and blame know-it-all doctors. By denouncing the coercion of lockdowns, authoritarians can masquerade as libertarians. Without any need to maintain consistency, they can imply one day that Covid doesn’t exist and the next day blame China for creating it. Their patter is their product – and they’ll tell the desperate and the delusional anything at all so long as they can make bank by doing so. Most of these people understand full well what’s at stake. They know that, when they spread misinformation and fantasy, some of us may die. But that’s a sacrifice they’re willing to make.

131076,commentisfree/2021/sep/29/covid-lawsuits-inquiries-pandemics-coronavirus,Opinion,Covid lawsuits and inquiries are looming – but blame won’t prevent future pandemics | Laura Spinney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/29/covid-lawsuits-inquiries-pandemics-coronavirus,"Earlier this month, proceedings opened in Austria in a civil suit brought against the authorities by the widow and son of a man who died of Covid-19 after staying in Ischgl, the ski resort widely regarded as having hosted a super-spreader event early in the pandemic. The week before, former French health minister Agnès Buzyn was ordered by a court to answer, essentially, for the government’s lack of anticipation of the pandemic. In the UK, meanwhile, the government has promised a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis. It’s due to start next spring. Those pushing for it to begin sooner argue that the lessons learned could still save lives, but apportioning blame is another function of a public inquiry. The finger of blame has hovered over this pandemic since the beginning, and now it is tapping on actual shoulders. It’s understandable that people who are grieving should want answers, and likely that governments could learn lessons that would save lives before this pandemic is over. It’s far from clear, however, that the blame game will help the bereaved or ensure that any of us are better protected against future pandemics. In fact, it could do the opposite. First, finding blame among those who coordinated the pandemic response at local or national levels diverts attention from those cross-border human activities, such as the industrial-scale farming of animals, that inflate the risk of a pandemic happening in the first place. Second, all the efforts to identify culprits are illuminated by the incandescent glow of hindsight, when even scientists were in the dark at the time of many of the events in question. Even in hindsight, it’s difficult to assess whether a given official decision was justified in terms of lives saved. Whose lives? Over what timeframe? Valued how? If people in positions of authority know that whatever they do they will be criticised – being accused of underreacting or overreacting – the danger is they’ll do nothing at all next time. This is one of those cases where history is instructive. In 1918, US president Woodrow Wilson prioritised the war over the worst pandemic in modern history – which killed many more Americans – and nobody really complained. Fifty years later, when another flu pandemic erupted, Gerald Ford was advised that the US could be facing something similar and announced a mass vaccination campaign. That pandemic turned out to be mild compared with 1918, and the president drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Buzyn can console herself that, during the even more anticlimactic 2009 flu pandemic, her predecessor in the French health ministry, Roselyne Bachelot, was ridiculed for having to cancel tens of millions of vaccine doses that she had ordered pre-emptively.
The depressing lesson is that history is hopelessly uninformative about the next pandemic, and crystal clear that the politician who does nothing to prevent it will be more warmly thanked at the ballot box than the one who does. There’s a novel spin on the blame game looming: lawsuits against those who negligently or intentionally caused others to become infected with Covid-19 by, for example, refusing to get vaccinated against it. No such suit has been brought yet, but legal scholar Dorit Reiss of the University of California Hastings College of the Law believes it’s only a matter of time, and that it will come in one of two forms. The first is a civil suit brought by an individual who contracted Covid, or their relative, against another individual such as a teacher or care home worker who refused a vaccine and from whom the plaintiff’s infection can be easily traced (the school or home might also be sued, in this scenario). The second is a class action against an organisation that spread vaccine misinformation, such as Children’s Health Defense, chaired by Robert Kennedy Jr, or America’s Frontline Doctors. If neither kind of suit has been announced so far, it’s because both face big hurdles. Without dwelling on the legal niceties, which depend on the jurisdiction in which the case is brought, these fall into three main categories: proving that the defendant had a duty to protect others; if they had a duty, proving that they behaved unreasonably; and proving that they caused harm, in this case in the form of infection. Proving causation is the toughest of these, but as more people get vaccinated and the conditions for Covid transmission are better understood, it’s getting easier. Suing an organisation for putting out misinformation faces an additional hurdle – the right in many jurisdictions to free speech. The first such case will be a fascinating test whose outcome is hard to predict. Take the UK, where the law already tends to place the individual before the collective. In recent decades, people who have suffered vaccine injury have generally been compensated through a no-fault damage payment scheme rather than via the courts. Such schemes – which also exist in the US and elsewhere – embody the notion that any risk associated with conferring a collective benefit was not actively created and is therefore nobody’s fault. The same could be argued for someone who withheld that benefit: they didn’t choose to pose a risk to others. The US is a good candidate to host a test case. So is Israel, because as Ido Baum, a legal commentator for Haaretz told me, it’s a highly litigious country where “filing a lawsuit for getting an email spam is almost a sport”, and ordinary people routinely use the courts to drive social change. Yet when Baum wondered aloud in a recent column about why a case hadn’t yet been brought for negligent Covid infection in Israel, he was surprised by the response: readers overwhelmingly disapproved of such a step. Even if a test case was to fail, says legal scholar Tsachi Keren-Paz of the University of Sheffield, it would probably shift the debate over where the balance should be struck between individual and collective rights and responsibilities. That debate is already under way, with proposals ranging from holding negligent Covid spreaders liable for the costs of tracking and containing the outbreak they caused, to criminalising their behaviour as dangerous driving is criminalised. On one side are those who want more legal protection for the collective, on the other those who argue that coercion is not the way, and could backfire by pushing the vast majority of vaccine refusers – who merely have doubts or questions – into more extreme positions. Covid is already changing the law, as scholars grapple with the legality of the many unprecedented interventions we’ve seen in the past 20 months – from lockdowns and furlough schemes to mask or vaccine mandates. The question is, should those changes make the blame game easier to play? If our goal is to be better protected the next time we face such a crisis, the answer is probably no. It would be better to ask why our social contract is unravelling, and what we can do to bolster solidarity. The public inquiry that managed to tackle those questions, in a no-fault environment, would serve a useful function indeed.

131457,commentisfree/2021/sep/27/data-israel-covid-booster-shots-standard,Opinion,The message from Israel is clear: Covid booster shots should be standard | David O’Connor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/27/data-israel-covid-booster-shots-standard,"In the summer, Israel began offering third doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to the over-60s. It was the first country to start administering “booster shots”, to people vaccinated at least five months previously. The prime minister, Naftali Bennett, announced the decision after a study by Leumit Health Services, an Israeli healthcare provider, showed that those over the age of 60 who had been vaccinated more than five months previously were three times more likely to be infected than those vaccinated more recently. As of 29 August, Israel began offering a third dose to everyone aged 12 and older, who had waited this period of time. The question for other countries is now whether to follow Israel’s lead. The first data evaluating the early impact of the third dose programme were published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). It showed that two weeks after more than 1.1 million over-60s had received their third dose, they were 11.3 times less likely to become infected with the exceptionally contagious Delta variant that currently predominates in Israel and across the world. In other words, third doses are highly effective at preventing people from becoming infected with Delta, among those who are willing to be vaccinated. When third doses dramatically reduce a person’s susceptibility to infection, it creates a barrier to the onward transmission and spread of the virus. This is important because growing numbers of people are getting infected despite being vaccinated (though the risks of infection, spread and severe illness remain greatest among those who are unvaccinated). And they have similar peak levels of virus in their noses to those who are unvaccinated, contributing to the unrelenting spread of the virus. Third doses stimulate the production of neutralising antibodies that are both higher in magnitude and have greater breadth against viral variants than those elicited by a second dose. Taken together, booster jabs aren’t just an immune refresher – they are an immunological upgrade. These superior neutralising antibody responses create an immunological buffer that is effective even against the Sars-CoV-2 Delta variant, explaining the dramatic reduction in risk of infection following third doses in Israel. The same buffer would be expected to reduce the need for frequent “boosting” in the future, as higher levels of neutralising antibodies are predicted to confer longer-lasting immunity. Other countries have watched the Israeli data closely but have been reluctant to embrace universal third doses for younger people for two main reasons. First, current vaccine programmes outside Israel continue to protect from severe disease, hospitalisation and death. This is a reasonable standard for evaluating vaccine protection, but it is not the only one. The crippling impact of Delta variant infections on hospitalisations in many locations in the US, despite widely available vaccinations, exposes the limits of using this as the sole benchmark. An alternative reasonable standard for assessing vaccine impact is the prevention of even clinically mild infections in order to minimise transmission within communities. The status quo of vaccinated individuals who are not optimally protected from infection and transmission, sizeable populations (eg, young children) who are not allowed to be vaccinated, and large numbers of unvaccinated individuals have allowed Delta infections to rage. Dramatically lowering the number of infections among people who have been vaccinated three times, one of the key outcomes of the NEJM paper, quickly reduces the number of susceptible individuals who are able to sustain the virus’s continued spread. Israel is already providing a real-world test of this concept, and the recent decline in its new cases is encouraging. Of course, such programmes need to exist alongside efforts to immunise those unvaccinated who are at the highest risk. Persuading unvaccinated people has been difficult, even with financial incentives and other creative strategies. Meanwhile, there is a sizeable segment of the population who would enthusiastically clamour for third doses as soon as they become available. Implementing third-dose programmes would provide an immediate benefit directly to this highly motivated group and the communities in which they live, while programmes aimed to encourage unvaccinated people to be immunised continue. Second, there is an understandable worry that programmes such as Israel’s perpetuate inequality. More vaccines are undoubtedly needed for more people in more places. This alone should not preclude consideration of third-dose programmes in vaccine-experienced countries struggling with Delta outbreaks. While the breathtaking short-term protection observed in clinical trials initially supported a two-dose vaccine series, the newer data suggests that a primary immunisation series followed by an additional dose months later should be the new standard protocol. This is already the schedule for other viral vaccines, such as the hepatitis B vaccine.
This does not mean that the needs of the rest of the world should be ignored. Indeed, the potential need for three vaccine doses to minimise the threat of Covid-19 globally should be a clarion call to invest immediately in sustainable immunisation programmes worldwide. Creating and maintaining the infrastructure for sustainable programmes would likely have the side-effect of improving access to other critical vaccines that are also not yet universally available. For example, less than 75% of infants in Africa receive all three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine. There is precedent for such massive, transformational infrastructure investments that benefit public health: UNAids estimates that more than 70% of those with HIV now have sustainable access to antiretroviral drugs. Facing a potentially difficult winter, countries with an existing vaccine supply are at a crossroads. There is a tendency to look askance at data that was collected in other countries whose demographics and Covid-19 epidemics are subtly different. The Israeli experience is not perfectly aligned with other countries that use multiple different vaccine types, with different timing of vaccination, have varying population demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and Covid-19 burdens. The biology of Sars-CoV-2 immunity, however, is the same whether you’re in Tel Aviv, Tokyo or Toronto. The pioneering Israeli work of making third doses the standard provides an instructive template for other countries to follow as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that this becomes the global standard of vaccination for everyone, no matter where they live.

131789,commentisfree/2021/sep/25/why-cant-we-tackle-covid-and-climate-heating-nationalism-and-stupidity,Opinion,Why can’t we tackle Covid and climate heating? Nationalism and stupidity | Nick Cohen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/25/why-cant-we-tackle-covid-and-climate-heating-nationalism-and-stupidity,"Even if you think humans are nothing more than a selfish, tribal species who care little for anyone beyond our clans and ourselves, the failure to vaccinate the world remains astonishing. It is not only a moral affront that rich nations are leaving millions to die needless deaths but an assault on our own self-interest. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the world economy risks losing $4.5tn (£3.3tn) by 2025 if Covid-19 spreads unchecked. Gordon Brown, the World Health Organization’s new ambassador for global health financing, tells me the cost of supplying enough vaccines to inoculate all poor nations is about £70bn. In countries with rudimentary health services the usual problems of delivery remain, but no one doubts that trillions of dollars could be unlocked by the spending of a sum that is trifling in comparison. Yet the rich world won’t spend. Nor will it act to squash the small risk that the virus will mutate into a variant that can evade vaccines. Covid has torn up our lives and haunted our dreams. If you live in the UK or US, you are fortunate if you do not know someone who has died from the virus. Yet, when faced with a peril everyone acknowledges, whose consequences are devastating, the world cannot act. If the response to the pandemic is a guide, the grand promises governments are making to prevent climate catastrophe will come to little. If they cannot take seriously an immediate danger staring them in the face, how will they manage to take sustained and expensive countermeasures against climate change that require sacrifices and commitments over decades? When I asked Brown to explain the failure, he replied with admirable brevity: “Nationalism and stupidity.” The nationalism is honeyed over by supposed progressives. Last week, Joe Biden hosted a Covid summit where he announced he would donate an extra 500m vaccines to middle- and low-income countries. He sounded impressive. But so did President Emmanuel Macron in 2020 when he said we should not tolerate “a two-speed world where only the richer can protect themselves”. Every leader in the west has said much the same. Notwithstanding their fine sentiments, less than 2% of the population of low-income countries has received even one dose. Everyone suspects that rich countries are paying for sweetheart deals with vaccine manufacturers. Officials at the WHO-led Gavi alliance, which is trying to buy vaccines for poor countries, tell me manufacturers won’t say where their orders are in the queue or whether they would consider giving them priority. For all the cooing and kind words, promises from Biden and his counterparts cannot be believed. As the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said last week, the triumph of science in producing vaccines had been undone by “lack of political will, selfishness and mistrust”. What he called the “obscenity” of rich world indifference comes in two parts. First, promised deliveries of vaccines to the poor world have never arrived. Oxford University data analysts found the UK had delivered less than 7% of the vaccines it has promised developing countries. Overall, of the 554m doses promised by the richest nations, only 90.8m, or 16%, had reached their destination. Those that did came in dribs and drabs, making planning vaccination campaigns impossible. Arguments about whether it is right for rich countries to engage in medically dubious initiatives to vaccinate teenagers or give booster jabs to the vulnerable are almost beside the point. By February 2022, 15bn doses will have been produced: more than enough to vaccinate the world. Governments, however, have allowed neurotic nationalism to turn them into misers who hoard more vaccines than they could possibly need. The second obscenity lies in the fate of their hidden treasure. Airfinity, a science analytics company, estimates that by the end of 2021, G7 countries may throw away 241m vaccines that have passed their expiry date. Brown describes their destruction as “unconscionable” and says he will send the projections to Biden, Johnson and EU leaders.
It is a cliche of western responses to see the poor world as filled with corrupt and failed states. Imagine what African and Asian news teams could now say about us. Camera crews might film vaccines being crushed into landfill sites, as the reporters intoned that, though it was harsh to admit it, the truth was that childish and irresponsible westerners were so prone to wastefulness they could not be trusted to govern themselves. Rational self-interest is the best form of selfishness and it is clearly absent today. More common is an embittered parochialism, which begins by not wanting to think about the rest of humanity and ends by hating them. God knows but I had my disagreements with Brown when he was in government. But there is no greater sign of the triumph of stupid nationalism than the replacement of Brown and politicians who could rise to a crisis with the babbling, play-acting, post-Brexit caricatures. They took power by saying that foreigners were trying to swindle honest Brits and cannot now show generosity to the rest of the world. The knowledge that we will not be safe until everyone is safe has aroused a determination among the worst of nationalists not to be driven by science or bow before multinational institutions. The know-nothing spirit that animated the Trump and Brexit movements has survived into the pandemic. The Trump administration withdrew from the World Health Organization. The Johnson government cut the foreign aid budget in the middle of an emergency when poor countries needed help most and the UK needed the epidemiological protection and economic stimulus that a global effort to contain Covid would bring. It did so safe in the knowledge that the majority of the public would not care. Since the start of the pandemic, news bulletins have repeated the number of Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths. When the regulators approved vaccines, the numbers of those who had received one and then two jabs were added. But at no point do we hear how many vaccines are going to countries that cannot afford to buy them. Until that changes, there will be no hope of tackling Covid, let alone the catastrophic climate crisis that is rushing towards us like an unstoppable storm. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",2021-09-25 18:00:02+00:00,131790,2
132492,commentisfree/2021/sep/22/children-covid-vaccinations-women-relief,Opinion,Getting kids vaccinated isn’t just a health victory. It’s a lifeline for millions of women | Moira Donegan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/22/children-covid-vaccinations-women-relief,"It was the news that parents had been waiting to hear for more than a year and a half: on Monday, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children aged five to 11. The pediatric dose, administered at one-third the volume of the adult dose, creates a “robust” immune response that is predicted to protect child patients from severe disease and death from Covid. Crucially, the trials, in which the vaccine was administered to 2,268 children, found no cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that is a very rare but serious side-effect of some mRNA vaccines in adults. The companies are requesting emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) and if the FDA moves at the same pace that it did in granting emergency approval for the adult vaccine, that will mean that vaccinations of school-aged children could begin as early as Halloween – though logistical and political obstacles could still delay the shots. The announcement is a light at the end of the tunnel for parents, who have seen their children’s lives unfairly warped by the coronavirus pandemic. Schools were closed, activities were shuttered, and opportunities to visit relatives or play with other kids were suddenly fraught with risk. During the long wait for child vaccinations, the commentary on the urgency of vaccine development has rightly focused on the pandemic’s devastating effects on children – medical, educational and developmental. But the prospect of child vaccines also offers much needed relief for the adults, most of them women, who are tasked with caring for children: teachers, childcare workers and, above all, mothers. The ability to vaccinate kids, and the hope for more regular and dependable schooling and childcare that it brings, could be tremendously meaningful for women’s equality. Women were economically devastated by the pandemic, and childcare responsibilities were a big part of why. With schools and daycares closed, and female-dominated sectors like the service industry hit especially hard, women were forced out of their jobs at a disproportionate rate between February 2020 and March 2021. An estimated 1.8 million women dropped out of paid work during that time, erasing, in just one year, 30 years’ worth of women’s gains in the workforce. In December 2019, before the pandemic struck, researchers found that women held a slim majority of the nation’s salaried jobs – 50.04%. It was the first time in history that women were the majority of the workforce. But in March and April 2020, about 3.5 million mothers of school-age children left paid work. Many have returned to work since. Others have not. At the beginning of 2021, there were 1.4 million fewer working mothers than there were at the beginning of 2021. Of those who did not leave their jobs, the pandemic placed huge childcare responsibilities on parents, particularly mothers, that drained energy and focus from paid work. Blue-collar workers missed shifts and scrambled to find childcare for the hours they had to spend on the job. Meanwhile, many white-collar workplaces responded by adjusting their workplace cultures – making hours more flexible, allowing breaks for childcare, and becoming accustomed to toddlers wandering in the backgrounds of Zooms. But these adjustments, welcome as they were, were not enough to alleviate the added stress placed on mothers who continued to work for pay while also supervising children round the clock. Many women who did not leave the workforce found that they still fell behind. Women’s economic losses are not just a matter of stalled individual ambitions. They have broad social implications. Women’s incomes are essential for the economic security of their households. A study by the Center for American Progress found that in 2017, before Covid, 41% of women were the sole or primary breadwinners in their families. Their retreat from the paid workforce has contributed to the economic downturn nationwide. And in individual families, a mother’s paid work often has benefits beyond the financial. It also has the ability to foster gender equity within the home. Women who earn their own money have more influence over household decisions, and have more ability to leave relationships that turn unhappy or abusive. There is some evidence, too, that children raised by working mothers benefit psychologically from their moms’ independence. A Harvard study showed that children raised by working moms are just as happy in adulthood as children raised by stay-at-home mothers, and that women whose mothers worked while they were growing up perform better in their own careers. But with the pandemic-induced childcare crisis closing schools and unvaccinated children under their mothers’ care for greater and greater swaths of the day, much of these advantages were lost. Much of this was supposed to be alleviated at the start of this school year, when many schools finally reopened for full-time, in-person classes. But with no vaccines available to children under 12, elementary and middle schools remained vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks and quarantines have been frequent. Even in those lucky districts that have been able to institute safety measures such as social distancing, improved ventilation and mandatory mask-wearing, schools have still posed some risk: after all, with children under 12 still unable to access the vaccine, schools are indoor gatherings of large numbers of unvaccinated people. The inability to administer vaccines to children has made schools, as childcare, both risky and unreliable. Parents must send their kids there, knowing the risks but also knowing that if they do not send their kids to school, they will sacrifice both their children’s educations and their own livelihoods. But because of the frequency of outbreaks, some families find that their children are sent home anyway. Teachers and childcare workers, who are overwhelmingly women, find themselves in this bind, too: they risk both exposing their own kids to the virus in schools and daycares, and being exposed themselves. The risks of exposure to the virus in rooms full of unvaccinated kids has made childcare centers even more expensive and even more difficult to staff, as many workers calculate that the money they earn taking care of children does not justify the risk to their health. That, too, forces more women out of the workforce. It will take more than child vaccinations to reverse the trend that has forced women out of paid work. A long-term vision for women’s economic equality will require paid leave policies, more robust equal pay measures, universal childcare, enforcement of laws against sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination, and many, many more unions. But the prospect of vaccinated kids is welcome news for women workers who have been saddled with a dangerous and unjust double burden of work and childcare, without sufficient support for either. Hopefully now, with kids’ shots on the way, working mothers can breathe a little easier. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",2021-09-22 12:23:55+00:00,132493,2
133065,commentisfree/2021/oct/29/pregnant-women-vaccinated-covid-mother-child,Opinion,It’s scandalous so few pregnant women in the UK are vaccinated against Covid | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/29/pregnant-women-vaccinated-covid-mother-child,"It is coming up to a year since the first mRNA vaccines were approved for use against Covid-19, and almost seven months since they were approved for expectant mothers. The initial government advice was was that they should hold off getting a jab, but since more data has become available, medical experts have been encouraging women to get vaccinated. But there has been no big government awareness campaign, despite pregnant women being identified as a vulnerable group. I knew the proportion of fully vaccinated pregnant women in the UK would be low, but I did not expect it to be as low as 15% (in the US, it is more than twice that, at 33.8%). That such a small porportion of pregnant women are fully vaccinated in the UK, seven months after vaccines were approved for them, is nothing short of a scandal. And more women and their babies are at risk of dying because of it. Recent figures for England show that one in six critically ill patients are unvaccinated pregnant women with Covid. Of the 20 pregnant women requiring the highest level of life-saving care, 19 were unvaccinated and one had received one dose. These are frightening statistics, but on their own they do not seem to be enough to persuade pregnant women to get vaccinated. In order to do that, it’s important to understand why we are seeing such high levels of hesitancy. Women are used to being told to avoid certain foods and medication when they are pregnant. In the absence of data that can be ethically collected, patients become accustomed to a “better not, just in case” philosophy. Conflicting opinions abound, and vary from country to country. Can you have a glass of wine? Eat feta? Take medication? Use sun lotion? In this way, pregnant women are primed to always take what they believe is a risk-averse approach. In February, at the very beginning of the vaccine rollout, a pregnant friend of mine, a doctor who worked in ICU, had her first dose of an mRNA vaccine to protect her and her baby against Covid-19. At the time, this went against government advice, as there was not much data available. However, she did her own literature review and rightly concluded that there would be no conceivable reason that the vaccine’s ingredients would cross the placenta or harm her baby, and got her jab. Most pregnant women do not have the scientific grounding that my friend has. But at various points this year, I have reflected how easy it would have been to have furnished them with a factsheet or a leaflet explaining the science and how it works, making clear that, despite the initial absence of data, there was no scientific reason to suggest the vaccine would harm their baby, and laying out the risks to pregnant women of staying unvaccinated.
Instead, pregnant women have been left to do their own research. Government agencies have created a vacuum that has been filled by disinformation. There has been little information given about the risks to pregnant women, short of saying that they are at increased risk of severe illness, and minimal comment on the risk that even a mild case of Covid might pose to a baby. When you are pregnant your immune system is suppressed. Your uterus is expanding, putting pressure on your lungs. Having Covid at around the time of birth makes a woman twice as likely to have a premature delivery or stillbirth, and more likely to need an emergency caesarean. We have known this since May. My doctor friend concluded that the risks from having Covid and low oxygen levels while pregnant were far greater than any unfeasible, theoretical risk from the vaccines. There has been mixed messaging, even from medical professionals. Another pregnant friend of mine, who also works in the NHS, held off having the vaccine earlier this year, but, deciding the risks were too great for her and her baby, went on to have both doses in the second trimester. “NHS staff haven’t helped,” she says. “I had to take my husband with me for moral support because they kept telling me that I had to weigh up risks and benefits and there was no evidence it wouldn’t harm my pregnancy. It was terrifying!” Several friends of hers had the same experience and also went ahead, and all have since had their babies. But they shouldn’t have needed to fight in order to access crucial medical care, and they should have received information and encouragement about the vaccine – just as pregnant women do for flu and whooping cough vaccinations. Instead, pregnant women describe receiving no prompts or messages, and some say they have had to seek out the factsheets and bring it up themselves with doctors and midwives. More than 100,000 pregnant women in England and Scotland have received a Covid-19 vaccine with no adverse effects recorded. More than 160,000 pregnant women in the US have had a Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) with no safety concerns being raised. Early data from three US safety monitoring systems did not find any safety concerns for pregnant people who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine late in pregnancy or for their babies. No increased risk of miscarriage was found among people who received a vaccine just before and during early pregnancy (before 20 weeks of pregnancy). No safety concerns were found in animal studies. And the antibodies produced may well help to protect your baby (research is ongoing on this). The low take-up of vaccines among pregnant women makes me despair. It is an outrage, and increased pressure on maternity services will not help. Some women are not seeing a single medical professional for the first 12 weeks of their pregnancies – surely a giant missed opportunity for a conversation about vaccination. The tone towards the pregnant population has been one of blame, but we should not be blaming women who have been left without clear messaging. Why has this group been so neglected when other vulnerable groups have not? Now that England has ditched masks and loosened other restrictions, some of these women will have essentially become shut-ins for the duration of their pregnancies. If they do mix, in waiting rooms, at NCT classes and other in-person groups, they put vaccinated pregnant women and their babies at risk. But it is not their fault: they have been failed, and more women and babies are at risk of dying as a result.

133136,commentisfree/2021/oct/29/how-does-covid-end-uk-virus-endemic,Opinion,How does Covid end? The world is watching the UK to find out | Laura Spinney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/29/how-does-covid-end-uk-virus-endemic,"As Cop26 gets under way in Glasgow this weekend, one collective action problem is taking centre stage against the backdrop of another. Covid-19 has been described as a dress rehearsal for our ability to solve the bigger problem of the climate crisis, so it seems important to point out that the pandemic isn’t over. Instead, joined-up thinking has become more important than ever for solving the problem of Covid-19. The endgame has been obvious for a while: rather than getting rid of Covid-19 entirely, countries will get used to it. The technical word for a disease that we’re obliged to host indefinitely is “endemic”. It means that the disease-causing agent – the Sars-CoV-2 virus in this case – is always circulating in the population, causing periodic but more-or-less predictable disease outbreaks. No country has entered the calmer waters of endemicity yet; we’re all still on the white-knuckle ride of the pandemic phase. In the pandemic phase, outbreaks are unpredictable and bad. There are simply too many people who remain susceptible to the virus, either because they’re unvaccinated or because they haven’t yet encountered the now-dominant Delta variant, which transmits even among the fully vaccinated. The virus will find most of them eventually – even if it does not cause them all to become seriously ill. Only when such pools of susceptibility have dried up can we say the pandemic is over, the infectious disease modeller Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine told me. From then on, the disease’s spread will be sustained by gentler forces such as the gradual waning of immunity in the human population, and the emergence of relatively mild new variants. But nobody knows yet when that will happen, because there’s uncertainty about how long a person remains immune to Sars-CoV-2 following natural infection or vaccination, and about the virus’s capacity to generate variants that aren’t mild. One thing is clear: the transition to endemicity will happen at different times in different countries and regions. It’s not unreasonable to think that the UK, with its high case numbers and vaccination rates, might be among those closest to the tipping point – which is why other countries are watching it closely. Delta, which is around three times as transmissible as the original Wuhan variant of Sars-CoV-2, has yet to reach many countries, but since May it has been dominant in the UK, where it has spread like wildfire since “freedom day” on 19 July. That’s why some scientists think the UK is entering its final pandemic wave, from which it will exit into the endemic phase next spring. Others think the pandemic has several more waves left in it, even in the UK. The waves may be smaller than in the past, especially since vaccines have broken the link between infection and hospitalisation to a large degree. But Britons may still be facing another year or more during which vulnerable people die in large numbers, others report the debilitating effects of long Covid, and health systems creak and potentially crack under the strain. Every country will eventually reach endemicity, but the UK is heading there very fast – and there will inevitably be a human toll to pay. Letting the virus rip, even in a highly vaccinated population, carries other risks too. “The high case numbers in the UK at the moment can only increase the risk of emergence of variants of concern,” the modeller Robin Thompson of the University of Warwick told me. We have yet to see a Covid variant that causes severe disease even in the fully vaccinated. Touch wood, we won’t. Virologist Didier Trono of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland is cautiously optimistic that SARSars-CoV-2 is nearing the limits of its capacity to adapt. Though new variants continue to emerge – such as AY.4.2, which recently started spreading in the UK – these have only been slightly more transmissible than Delta, at most, and the disease is not dramatically more severe now than it was in early 2020. But as immunity grows in the population, so does the selective pressure for the virus to mutate and escape that immunity. Vaccinologists are working hard to prepare for this risk. It’s a race to the finish, in other words, but a race that might not be won by the fastest. At this point, vaccines are protecting us individually, not collectively. But the form that the endemic disease will take will be shaped collectively. The future of Covid-19 could be as mild as a common cold, but it could be worse. The response to this future disease may need to be more onerous than the response to flu, which involves only an annual vaccination campaign. “I don’t think we can rule out a situation where Covid, though endemic, puts overwhelming pressure on health systems in some years,” Kucharski told me. That’s why the pandemic is still very much a collective action problem, and why the coming wave – whether or not it’s the exit wave – should be met with masks, other light social distancing measures where and when required, and a high uptake of booster shots among those who are eligible. The strategy has to remain as nimble as the virus, which also means ensuring that there is no trade-off between booster campaigns in wealthy countries and the rollout of initial vaccine doses in poorer ones. Sars-CoV-2 may have been cornered, but it hasn’t been tamed; it still has plenty of bite in it. And, as Cop26 reminds us, it’s just the dry run.

133348,commentisfree/2021/oct/28/covid-measures-choice-restrictions-science-freedom-infections-safe,Opinion,Covid measures give us choice. They are not restrictions on British life,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/28/covid-measures-choice-restrictions-science-freedom-infections-safe,"Calls for the government to introduce extra measures to contain Covid have grown louder. At the last count these came from the NHS Federation, the British Medical Association, Macmillan Cancer, the behaviours and modelling subcommittees of the emergency science group Sage, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, regional public health directors and metropolitan mayors. Yet the government has responded by saying it sees no need for restrictions, and that it is opposed to lockdown in all forms. What is telling here is not only the decision not to act, but the way in which the government’s framing of the issues serves to justify that decision. Covid measures are characterised as Covid restrictions or even a lockdown. Those calling for action can thereby be characterised as fanatics who want to remove our liberty while the government presents itself as defender of our freedoms, preserving “normality”. This has been an effective strategy. After all, who wants lockdown? So if you are labelled a lockdown supporter, you have probably lost the argument. And the reason why this finger-pointing strategy has gained traction is because – probably more as a result of thoughtlessness than collusion – it is echoed by most of the media. Almost daily I am asked by journalists whether people will accept new Covid restrictions. So in response to all those queries: if I had to list the most important new measures necessary to supplement vaccines and bring infections down, this is what they would be: to ensure adequate ventilation of all indoor public spaces, which can mitigate the effect of even mass indoor gatherings on infection spread; and to limit the number of contacts people have through measures based on protection rather than restriction – because if you double contacts, you double the number of people we are each likely to infect or be infected by. As the Immensa lab scandal showed, it’s very harmful when large numbers of infected people continue to circulate in the community. Regarding ventilation, I would institute a system whereby all public spaces were required to indicate their “clean air” status, just as kitchens in restaurants are required to indicate their hygiene status. I would also improve the messaging so that people know how important it is and how to know when they are safe. This wouldn’t amount to a restriction. It’s a protection. It doesn’t limit choice. On the contrary, in increasing the number of spaces that are safe, it gives us more choice. In order to limit social contacts, I would give people the choice to work from home where possible. Studies of mixing show that we had on average 11 or 12 contacts a day pre-pandemic. In the spring of this year, that went as low as three. It then crept up to four in the summer, and now stands at about five. But this isn’t because of people socialising more. It’s largely down to people mixing at work, whether they want to or not. Obviously, working from home isn’t possible for everyone. But give people the option. Once again, this is not a matter of restriction but of protection; and it increases, rather than limits, choice. Finally, in order to increase self-isolation – without which all the money spent testing and tracing is largely squandered – I would do the obvious thing. It’s the thing that has been called for since the start of the pandemic, and which government has consistently ignored. I would provide comprehensive support for people to stay at home: adequate financial support, support with hotel accommodation for those in crowded, multi-generational households, practical support (if one has caring responsibilities for instance, or needs the dog walked), and emotional support. The former health secretary Matt Hancock notoriously rejected such measures on the grounds that people might “game the system”; such disdain for the public has come at a huge cost. Self-evidently, here too we don’t need a restriction. These provisions would give people the choice to do what is demanded of them to stay at home. I am certainly not suggesting that these are the only measures needed. A requirement to wear masks in crowded places would involve a mild amount of restriction: though if everyone does wear masks this would provide more choice overall, especially to vulnerable people who may not feel safe to leave home. However, masks certainly don’t constitute lockdown, and three-quarters of the public support the wearing of them. What I would also suggest is that it’s unhelpful for the discussion of a “plan B” to focus on such measures as mask-wearing and to characterise the plan as being about restriction – or, worse, about lockdown. What we need right now, to supplement the vaccine rollout, is a set of protections and support measures to reduce the harm inflicted by Covid and relieve pressure on the NHS. In order to make that clear, politicians and journalists need to reframe the way they talk about the pandemic. Stop asking: will the public stick to the restrictions? Instead ask: will the government protect and support the public to keep one another other safe? The real irony is that, by conflating protection with lockdown and refusing to implement the protections necessary to bring infections down, keep people safe and relieve the pressure on the NHS, this increases the likelihood, as Sage noted this month, that more draconian measures will be needed in the future. In the end (and as we saw last year), the true lockdown party would be the “do nothing” party.

133553,commentisfree/2021/oct/27/daughter-bullied-school-covid-jab-government-campaign,Opinion,My daughter was bullied at school for having the Covid jab. No wonder UK take-up is low | Anonymous,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/27/daughter-bullied-school-covid-jab-government-campaign,"Last week my 13-year-old daughter “S” was offered the Covid vaccine at her school in England. I consented, as required, but made it clear that the final decision about whether to go ahead was hers. By this age, she is aware and responsible enough to be making decisions about her own body, with support, and crucially, clear information about what will be happening and why. We are a pro-vaccination family, although we have friends who aren’t – we have chosen to stay off the topic with them. My daughter is at an age where she seeks out a lot of information online, so I directed her to some websites to read up more widely about it, while emphasising the reasons why it was my strong preference for her to have the vaccine. S’s 15-year-old cousin was targeted outside school by anti-vaxxers a few weeks ago. When that happened, both S and her cousin were dismissive of the anti-vax arguments, and they thought gathering outside schools was totally inappropriate. These aren’t isolated incidents, sadly: this week there have been further reports of “sinister” anti-vax protests at schools in Liverpool. On the day S was due to get her vaccine in school, we had a final discussion about it. “Some of the kids are saying they won’t have it because they can’t see how it helps them,” she told me. “But I think that there’s a benefit to me being able to see grandma without worrying about infecting her. And I can’t face school closing again, so I’m a bit stressed, but I’m going to do it.”
Take-up at the school was low, partly because there was an issue with the consent form being difficult for some parents to access. Ultimately, S was the only child in her class to have the vaccine, with about 20% of her entire year group taking it up. She came home with a sore arm and slight headache, but other than that she was fine. She said that the vaccination team talked her through what was going to happen, and double-checked that she was sure before they went ahead. All was well until the following day, when another child in her class declared that because S had the vaccine, that meant she had now been injected with Covid – so if anyone went near her she would pass Covid on to them. This resulted in several children moving away from her, and refusing to sit beside her during lessons or at lunchtime. S came home extremely distressed and confused. Believing, rightly, that having the vaccine means that she’s safer in terms of transmission than the other unvaccinated children in her class, she wondered why she was the one to be singled out by an ill-informed child? I contacted the school, who quickly assured me that they would sort this out, particularly as they want to encourage more vaccine take-up. But it’s not hard to imagine that other children in the class, having seen what happened to my daughter, will now be wary of getting the vaccine for fear of being singled out. I very much doubt that my daughter is the only child in the country to have received this kind of reaction from schoolmates. On top of that, there are the pressures some children will be facing from their families not to have the vaccine, often because of concerns that it may not be safe for young people. I’m worried that part of the reason for a slow uptake of the vaccine among 12 to 15-year-olds is that their issues around it are not being addressed adequately: there’s a sense that they are just being tacked on at the end of the successful adult rollout. They need to be addressed directly and clearly, and their concerns listened to. I’ve seen a lot of “what I need to know about my child and the vaccine” articles for parents in recent weeks, but there don’t seem to be many equivalents for 12 to 15-year-olds to read themselves. Reels and videos on social media help, particularly those made by people in the same age group, but surely there needs to be more official – and factchecked – dedicated communications for teens who may have concerns about the vaccine. We live in the north-west, one of the worst-hit places in the country for Covid, and my daughter remains proud that she has played her part in tackling the virus. However, she still spent the weekend worried about going back into school as she felt that she was now a social pariah – thankfully this didn’t turn out to be the case. She says that she would have had the vaccine anyway if she’d known this was going to happen, but I’m not quite so sure. Social pressure in school can be difficult to handle. There are reports that the education secretary is considering writing to every individual in this age group to urge them to be vaccinated. That’s a start, but there needs to be a far stronger campaign to ensure that as many young people as possible get vaccinated – and they can do so without misinformation, anti-vax intimidation or fear of bullying.

You see, I’ve just found myself nodding along to Fox News. On Sunday, Fox News personality Neil Cavuto implored viewers to “toss the political speaking points” and get vaccinated. “Life is too short to be an ass,” he said, adding that he expected to be attacked for his views. Telling people to get vaccinated during a pandemic shouldn’t be controversial. Cavuto’s employer has worked overtime to ensure that it is. A recent analysis by a media watchdog found 60% of Fox News’ summer programming included claims undermining vaccinations. While Fox has been amplifying anti-vaxxer propaganda, however, it has also been quietly enforcing its own strict vaccination and testing policies. Nearly 90% of full-time employees at the Fox Corporation have been vaccinated, it was reported last month. The company has also said it will soon implement daily Covid testing for employees who haven’t had the jab. It has become depressingly clear that we’re not going to end this pandemic by relying on everyone to do what is best for the greater good. If we want to have any hope of getting back to normal then we need strict vaccine and testing requirements – as Fox, for all its posturing about freedom, clearly realises. There are heated debates across the world about how to implement this. Indonesia has made vaccines mandatory, with big fines for refuseniks. While it seems unlikely that most countries will go that far, vaccine mandates for people such as government employees and care workers have been implemented in countries including the US, Australia, France and – from 11 November – in England. As well they should be. There is nothing controversial about requiring people to get inoculated; vaccination requirements for school and travel have been in place for decades. If you’re marching in the street to protest against the “tyranny” of being forced to consider other people, please get a grip. Even Fox News hosts think you are being an ass.

133589,commentisfree/2021/oct/27/australia-did-a-good-job-in-the-face-of-covid-lets-apply-that-energy-to-other-public-health-problems,Opinion,Australia did a good job in the face of Covid. Let’s apply that energy to other public health problems | Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/27/australia-did-a-good-job-in-the-face-of-covid-lets-apply-that-energy-to-other-public-health-problems,"As the pandemic appears to be in decline, with cases dropping in Australia and worldwide infections appearing to slowly decrease, it is tempting to cry victory and declare this the end of our interest in public health. Even in the UK, where cases remain high, it’s encouraging to see the impact on vaccines with fewer deaths and hospitalisations than in previous waves. Australia has done well overall – our vaccination programs, while frustratingly slow to get going, have been an enormous success. The majority of Australians have had both of their shots, something that a year ago seemed like an impossibility. We’ve controlled a massive outbreak in New South Wales, and are (fingers crossed) going to see the same kind of reductions in Victoria as well. Unfortunately, the fight isn’t over, and public health will remain a pressing problem, probably forever.
Now, you might argue that I would say such things – I’m an epidemiologist, and we all think that our area of interest is the most important. A bit over a decade ago, when I was really into circus arts, I would’ve cheerfully argued that fire twirling was a cultural mainstay that was sadly underfunded by our cruel overlords. That being said, there are real and pressing problems we cannot ignore as we slowly move back into normal life. The most obvious issue is infectious disease – Covid-19 may have been the first major pandemic in most of our lifetimes, but there’s no assurance that it will be the last. Once-in-a-century events happen on average, well, every hundred years, but it’s entirely possible the next pandemic will arrive far sooner than that and we must be prepared when it comes. Moreover, the problem of non-infectious and chronic disease is something we were already grappling with when the nasty coronavirus came along. While estimates vary, we know around 10% of all adults in Australia have diabetes, much of which is likely preventable. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is estimated to cost the country at least $1bn each year in direct healthcare costs – hospitals, GP services, medicines etc – alone, without factoring in the impact the disease has on people’s wellbeing and livelihood. The reality is these are entrenched, socially-driven problems that are unlikely to go away any time soon. Public health is integral to every one of our lives, whether it be the pollutants we are being exposed to, food-borne disease outbreaks, or even just the crushing weight of chronic disease that burdens our society. This may sound depressing, but I think the message is quite the opposite – we’ve done an amazing job against Covid. In the last two years, as a country, we’ve proven that we can genuinely make a difference to change the course of our lives, health, and economy. There’s a palpable sense of relief that we haven’t had the pandemic experience those in the UK, Brazil, or India have. What we’ve really proven during Covid-19, above and beyond everything else, is that we have the ability to change the future of public health for the better, and we have the will to do it too. The key is not to forget the message of the pandemic, that we really can make improvements that will benefit both our health and wealth. Don’t get me wrong – the pandemic, and our responses to it, have caused harm. But we’ve proven we can take the momentum brought about by an impossible situation and make something really impressive out of it. For all our ills, as a country we have done a remarkably good job, and regardless of which measure you use, our nation comes out looking very good on the pandemic scorecard. Of course, we should be doing more internationally, and sending vaccines overseas seems like an absolute minimum to protect ourselves and our neighbours long term, but as a country we have done an objectively good job. Now let’s take that energy, and apply it to the other problems we as a society face. Next year, we could make preventing the next pandemic a topic on everyone’s lips. We may not be interested in coronaviruses forever, but we can act to prevent influenza every year, which may have a large benefit not just to health but our ability to work productively as well. The point is that public health is everyone’s problem, because we are all part of the same society. While we may go back to normal, we cannot ignore the messages of the last two years, because these issues will never really go away. We’ve shown we can respond effectively to a public health crisis during Covid-19 – now let’s use that same ethic to begin fixing all of the other problems that plague our society. • Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist working in chronic disease",2021-10-27 03:46:21+00:00,133590,2
133690,commentisfree/2021/oct/26/what-price-human-life-nhs-staff-politicians-nhs,Opinion,What price human life? Overworked NHS staff have to answer this every day | Rachel Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/26/what-price-human-life-nhs-staff-politicians-nhs,"A cynic, wrote Oscar Wilde, is somebody who “knows the price of everything and the value of nothing”. Nowhere do those words appear truer than in the matter of human life itself. What could be more distasteful than attaching a price tag to a person – as though their worth can be measured in pounds and pence? A human life, surely, is priceless; no amount of mere money or stuff comes close. The pandemic has destroyed such simple certainties. First, we stared in collective disbelief as Covid ravaged northern Italy. Next, we recoiled at the grotesque implications of achieving “herd immunity” by allowing the virus to race unchecked through the UK population, culling those deemed expendable by covert decree and government inaction. Quickly though, counter-narratives emerged. Lockdowns were pernicious and caused more harm than good. Economic Armageddon was deadlier than allowing older and economically unproductive people to die. The nation’s mental health mattered more than anything. This death was worth it, to avoid that one over there.
As we now approach our second winter with Covid-19, these debates – if you can call them that – have never been more poisonous. Healthcare workers in particular are subjected to slurries of hatred and abuse. Newly qualified nurses, volunteers at vaccination hubs and even children on their way to school have all been harangued in person by Covid anti-vaxxers. Perhaps the only thing anyone agrees on for certain is that we are all sick to death of the virus. Moral absolutes – such as clapping for key workers – now seem like ancient history. In this febrile context, it is easy to dismiss the current dire warnings from the NHS frontline – or to use them to push the case for privatisation. As the Telegraph’s associate editor, Camilla Tominey, puts it: “We have now locked down three times for the NHS. How many more do they need? Taxpayers are already pouring £3bn a week of their hard-earned cash into the health service … Forgive me, but what on earth have they been doing for the past six months, when the NHS hasn’t been overwhelmed by Covid?” A Times editorial goes one step further, declaring “the pandemic has intensified pressures on the service’s budgets. There is no realistic alternative to charging for treatment and extending the role of private insurance.” Confusingly, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, claims to the contrary that Covid plan B measures are not necessary since the NHS does not, apparently, face unsustainable pressures. From the perspective of NHS staff, Javid’s assertion feels like an outright denial of reality. I do not know a single colleague who thinks conditions inside the NHS right now are anything other than desperate. We are striving to address the vast backlog of care postponed due to Covid, but the truth is that the NHS has been in crisis for months now. Many hospitals – my own included – have been on black alert virtually continuously since early summer. This means that every bed in the hospital is full. Until a patient is discharged, no one new can be admitted. The knock-on effects for patients are pernicious. Paramedics are spending entire 12-hour shifts trapped on hospital forecourts, unable to hand over their sick patients to A&E. This means that some 999 calls are going unattended. Patients are dying at home or in the back of stationary ambulances, never receiving the hospital care that might have saved them. Last week, an anonymous paramedic in Cornwall said: “Imagine if we piled the bodies that have died because we have arrived too late outside the hospital next to each other so that everyone could see how badly the system is failing the public, then there would be public outcry … if they knew how many were dying needlessly then it would be on the front pages of every national newspaper.” These are “never events” in NHS parlance: these are events that fall so far short of acceptable standards of care they should not occur even once, let alone routinely. Never events are blighting cancer care too. For months, cancer operations have been intermittently cancelled due to lack of intensive care beds, but now even chemotherapy is being rationed too. Lucy Gossage, a consultant oncologist based in Nottingham, recently described her anguish at being forced to reserve chemotherapy for only those patients whose cancer is deemed curable. “Currently, we are unable to offer chemotherapy that aims to prolong life or palliate symptoms for many people with advanced cancer,” she wrote. “We hope this is very temporary, but it’s indicative of a system on its last legs.” If you are lucky enough to be brimming with health – the kind of person who rarely needs to see a GP, let alone pay a visit to hospital – all of this may feel remote and esoteric. It is very easy to turn a blind eye. In the NHS, though, we do not have that luxury. Ours is a gut-wrenching, zero-sum game in which there is absolutely no spare capacity. It does not matter that there are fewer Covid inpatients now than in January, when we are frenetically trying to deliver business as usual. Every patient in hospital with Covid takes resources away from another patient with cancer, heart disease, a stroke or sepsis. All of this highlights a fundamental truth. Human life, however much we want to pretend otherwise, most definitely has its price. We may feel squeamish voicing it out loud, but society permits some people to die because the cost to others of preventing those deaths is deemed too high. In short, we place a monetary value on human lives every day. Democratic elections simply set the parameters. The question we all need to ask as winter looms is: how much dying are we happy with? Are we OK with A&Es too full to function properly? Or with cancelled cancer surgeries and rationed chemotherapy? And if not, then what costs are we willing to incur so that these “never events” do not become routine occurrences? These are hugely difficult and uncomfortable conversations, with no glib or easy answers. It is our immense misfortune to have a prime minister who chooses to dodge rather than answer them.

133751,commentisfree/2021/oct/26/nhs-money-hyper-centralised-local-authorities,Opinion,Simply throwing money at the NHS won’t solve all its problems | Simon Jenkins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/26/nhs-money-hyper-centralised-local-authorities,"Watch the news each day and you might regard Britain’s NHS as a black, swirling pit into which ever vaster sums of money constantly vanish. All it does is answer back with screams of hospitals near collapse, queueing ambulances outside hospitals, year-long waiting lists, postponed tests and staffing crises. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, obsessed with daily headlines, hurls billions of pounds at it, to no obvious effect. Those who know the NHS all say the same. The NHS relies on the public thinking it wonderful, and as a result all it needs to do is demand money from the government. In 2007, the businessman Gerry Robinson made a celebrated documentary about trying to run an NHS hospital. At the end of a working day, the camera caught him getting into his car and collapsing into tears of frustration. The reason was not money. It was the opposition of the entire senior staff to any measure that might improve their performance or render their work more efficient. A classic issue is whether GPs, whose surgery productivity has been improved through the use of telephone consultations during the pandemic, should be forced back to in-person appointments, as the NHS is insisting under political pressure from the government. Elsewhere, the health service has long neglected specialist testing centres, plentiful in the private sector, for taking work from its hospitals. The result is tests delayed for years, and Sunak now rushing to build new centres. The NHS’s age-old rivalry with local government has blinded it to local elderly care as critical to its performance. Yet, in the early stages of the pandemic, it simply cleared elderly hospital patients into care homes, where thousands died and thousands more had to return to hospital. The pain – and cost – must have been enormous. As for the seven Nightingale hospitals created to treat Covid victims last year in a blaze of political publicity, they were largely unused. In all big public service organisations, value for money becomes impossible to measure. The NHS has long sought comfort in hiring cohorts of management consultants. Hundreds of millions have gone to firms such as McKinsey and Deloitte: vast sums of money spent with the supposed aim of saving other sums of money elsewhere. I know of no estimate that says a penny was worth it, yet no account is ever given. Challenging a public service to behave efficiently does not mean challenging its ideological status. Public healthcare is good. But in many countries across Europe, it is integrated with local government and in most cases is administered locally and without the chaos surrounding the NHS. Such processes also deliver outcomes that are often superior to those of Britain’s hyper-centralised system. The last thing the NHS needs is another “reorganisation”, as Sajid Javid promises. But it must reassure the public that it cares for efficiency if support is not to wear thin. “Protect the NHS” is Boris Johnson’s war cry. But protect it from whom?

134523,commentisfree/2021/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-facing-omicron-the-public-may-be-ahead-of-the-pm,Opinion,The Guardian view on facing Omicron: the public may be ahead of the PM | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-facing-omicron-the-public-may-be-ahead-of-the-pm,"Since the beginning of 2020, we have all become used to living with uncertainty: estimating relative risks; thinking of how to protect ourselves and others; attempting to plot out lives in which school, jobs, travel and time with loved ones have a question mark attached. Now that uncertainty has increased again. The World Health Organization has said that the Omicron variant poses a very high global risk of infection surges. Experts suggest that it will take around a fortnight before the extent of the threat it poses becomes clearer, in terms of how much it sickens those it infects and how well existing vaccines perform against it. The chief executive of the US drugmaker Moderna, Stéphane Bancel, has warned that “there is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness of vaccines] is the same level” as with Delta. The good news is that we are not back at square one: the variant is very unlikely to fully escape vaccines. This is why the government is once more counting on their power. It “will throw everything” at a booster drive, Boris Johnson said on Tuesday. The prime minister was announcing an ambitious target of 3.5m jabs a week, with all adults being offered (though not necessarily receiving) a booster by the end of January. The question is whether that is enough, and what we should do while we are waiting to find out. Even if Omicron proves no more likely than Delta to cause severe infection, it could still result in more hospitalisations and deaths if it is much more transmissible. It takes time to deliver boosters, and experts have repeatedly warned of the danger of counting on vaccines alone. Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, suggested that “not socialising when we don’t particularly need to” would be important; in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, people are advised to work from home if they can. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is encouraging mask wearing in all enclosed spaces. But with a hospitality industry struggling to get off its knees and Tory backbenchers instinctively opposed to even minor restrictions, Mr Johnson said he saw no need to change the overall guidance on how people live their lives and told them not to cancel Christmas parties. He believes this is a “balanced and proportionate” response. The public may disagree. In previous waves, it has proved – rightly – more cautious than the government, with people reducing contact before the first lockdown and cancelling Christmas plans before the prime minister called a halt to festivities at the 11th hour last year. One survey found that 68% believe it is likely that further restrictions will be needed during the Christmas period. Several theatres will now insist that audience members cover their faces. It is hard to understand why masks are required on public transport and in retail settings, but not when people sit through performances together for hours. The government now risks being behind both public opinion and the progress of Covid once more. It should extend mandatory masking and set out the risks of socialising inside more clearly so that people are better empowered to make their own decisions. Finally, it must address shockingly inadequate sick pay. No one disputes that those who are infected should stay at home. But people can only protect themselves when they have both the knowledge and resources to do so.",2021-11-30 18:57:24+00:00,134524,2
134604,commentisfree/2021/nov/30/anti-mask-blitz-war-public-good,Opinion,Let’s not pretend the anti-mask babies would have lasted a minute in the blitz | Marina Hyde,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/30/anti-mask-blitz-war-public-good,"While the scientists work out how bad the Omicron variant is or isn’t, the government has reimposed mask-wearing in shops and on public transport for at least the next three weeks. Consequently, a number of prams have been swiftly emptied of all toys. Across the airwaves – and up and down the train carriages and the supermarket aisles – you can find multiple refuseniks who suffer from the pandemic version of that old sexual problem: being “too big for condoms”. To those who have reacted to the precautionary mask-wearing mandate with histrionics and aggression, I think we have to say, very clearly: DO BUCK UP. This really isn’t the attitude that won us the war. As for mentioning the war, forgive me. Around 70,000 Britons died in second world war bombing raids, most of them in the blitz, while 145,000 have thus far perished from Covid. Yet somehow there does seem to be a large intersection between the Venn diagram sets “People who bang on endlessly about WW2” and “People who cannot cope with having to take a relatively minor public health measure for the greater good”. Of course, in London, both positions have links with the tube. In December 1940, you’d have been snatching a couple of hours’ troubled sleep on the underground platform while Hitler blew up your house. In December 2021, you’d be on your way to Oxford Street on the Central line to sample the pre-Christmas enticements of JD Sports. Yet still, somehow, managing to see a few minutes of mask-wearing in a non-ventilated space as an outrageous imposition on your personage, with which you – a stone-cold hero – simply shouldn’t be involved. But why? It’s really not that bad, is it, to have to wear a mask in limited settings, if it might help other people, even a bit? For all their big talk, you can’t help thinking those unable to bring themselves to do it wouldn’t make the first sacrifice for their fellow humans, let alone the ultimate one. As they shout – or type in capitals – the words “THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH”, it’s intriguing to remember that chaps like this really fancy their chances at having been able to cope with the blitz. Picture this person, this person who wets their pants and goes full online Braveheart over being asked to wear a mask between Liverpool Street and Holborn. Assuming they didn’t think air raid sirens were part of some “great reset” and ignored them (fatally), try to imagine this person trudging out of the tube station after the air raid. Try to imagine them discovering they didn’t have a street any more, having to remake their lives and those of their family in an anguished instant, by migrating somewhere else in the country in the clothes they stood in. Or try to imagine them having been taken in by friends or relatives, and turning straight back up to the bomb site with a broom to assist in clearing the rubble. I don’t want to be a bitch, but if you lose your mind over being asked to pop on a face covering in Boots, I honestly don’t think you’d be up to a whole lot of the above.
Admittedly, I appreciate that many people would prefer to hear public safety advice from Winston Churchill rather than Boris Johnson. But let’s not kid ourselves the advice would have been massively different, once adjusted for circumstance. For all their constant bleating about the government trying to control them, it’s a shame the poppy-shaggers and online warriors have absolutely zero understanding of how deeply embedded in people’s lives government was in the last world war, in the interests of the wider public good. How would these people have coped with rationing, for years and years on end? Being told by the state how many ounces of basic ingredients you were allowed per week feels a bit more of a pisser than being told to wear a mask while you load up your trolley with pounds and pounds of the stuff in Asda. (I know it’s kilos these days, but I didn’t want to send them really off the dial.) Then again, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe there was a whole section of British society in 1941 that was convinced the war was not actually real or happening, but was merely part of some great reset cooked up by various international powers. There were certainly enough profiteers at work to make elements of conspiracy theorising understandable, if not remotely excusable. And maybe that’s also the case in our own day and age. You can see where at least some of the suspicion has crept in. In the first days of the pandemic, when retailers were selling £3 hand sanitiser for £40, and bumping up the price of essentials just because they could, Johnson declared in parliament that there should be laws against this kind of thing. There weren’t any in the end. But we now know that another deeply distasteful type of profit-seeking was in fact directly licensed by the government – and that it resists scrutiny of it to this day. As well it might. Contracts for PPE were handed out to friends, donors, cronies, firms Owen Paterson worked for, Tory councillors, Matt Hancock’s publican … the list goes on. Much of this happened via VIP lanes and WhatsApps that have now mysteriously disappeared. Billions in taxpayers’ money were spent – but many of those billions were wasted. Individuals made staggering profits, often on items that ended up being unusable. Yet instead of being regarded as social pariahs, these people sail on regardless. Some of them are even in the House of Lords. It’s not a huge stretch to see how this kind of naked opportunism – some of which was straight profiteering – is a big part of why many ordinary people now feel they too can opt out of the idea of even minimal national effort. Pulling together should come from the top. If our overlords are so obviously out for themselves, how can we really all be in it together?

134660,commentisfree/2021/nov/30/obstetrician-pregnant-vaccinated-covid,Opinion,"As an obstetrician, here's my advice to pregnant women: get your vaccine and stay safe | Lucy Chappell",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/30/obstetrician-pregnant-vaccinated-covid,"As an obstetrician, I know first-hand the highs and lows that women experience when having a baby. It can be hugely rewarding for many and a daunting experience for some. Over the past months, the pandemic has added a great deal of uncertainty to the experience of pregnant women and those considering becoming parents. We know how dangerous the virus can be for pregnant women. The data published over recent months has been heartbreaking. Between July and October in England, one in five Covid patients receiving NHS treatment through a special lung-bypass machine were pregnant women who had not had their first jab. Around one in five women who are hospitalised with the virus need to be delivered preterm to help them recover – and one in five of their babies need care in the neonatal unit. New data from England shows that of those pregnant women in hospital with Covid, 98% are unvaccinated. Senior doctors and healthcare professionals from across the health system, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives, have been clear that the Covid vaccines are the best possible way pregnant women can protect themselves from the virus. Real-world data from the United States, where the vaccines have been given to more than 177,000 pregnant women, has also been reassuring that they’re safe for this group. Now, we have even more evidence to back the safety of the vaccines – with new data from the UK Health Security Agency showing there is no impact on newborns. The rate of stillbirths, low baby-birth weights and premature births is very similar for vaccinated women as it is for all women. It’s also incredibly reassuring to see the proportion of women giving birth who had received the vaccine increasing steadily over time – from 3% in May to 22% in August. Given that most pregnant women would have become eligible for the vaccine around June, in line with advice from our independent experts, this shows that more and more pregnant women are taking up the offer. Vaccine coverage at birth is expected to increase even further over the coming months. Boosters are also available six months after a second dose to pregnant women who are aged 40 and over, are health or social care workers or are in an at-risk group. We know there is more to be done, though – particularly to make sure that we reach pregnant women from all ethnic groups and from all backgrounds, as vaccine uptake varies by ethnicity and deprivation area. The government and the NHS are continuing to work closely with experts from medical organisations and community and faith leaders to provide information and advice at every possible opportunity to those in these groups, as well as pregnant women more widely. Every contact counts between a pregnant women and a healthcare professional. This new data on pregnancy outcomes provides important information to help pregnant women feel more confident about having the vaccine. The message I want to give is this: if you’re thinking about pregnancy, already pregnant, a new mother, or know someone who is pregnant or concerned about fertility, get your vaccine and stay safe.

134740,commentisfree/2021/nov/29/the-guardian-view-on-vaccines-and-omicron-upping-the-antibodies,Opinion,The Guardian view on vaccines and Omicron: upping the antibodies | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/29/the-guardian-view-on-vaccines-and-omicron-upping-the-antibodies,"It is by now fairly well known that the most serious cases of Covid-19 in the UK, and other rich countries, are increasingly concentrated among unvaccinated people. Between January and September, there were 34,474 deaths from Covid in England of unvaccinated people aged 10 or over, compared with 4,308 deaths of those who had received two vaccine doses (an alternative set of figures, also published by the Office for National Statistics and based on a different dataset, gives the totals of 40,966 unvaccinated deaths, compared with 5,104 double-vaccinated). The UK Health Security Agency has been careful to stress that the data “do not show causal links between vaccines and risks of mortality”. Other differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups could contribute to their differing death rates. But the contrast is dramatic, as are data relating to hospitalisation, with one recent analysis showing that of 40,000 Covid patients hospitalised, 84% were unvaccinated and just 3% double-vaccinated. Already, the relatively low take-up of vaccines among some groups was a cause for concern, not least among doctors who have described their distress when confronted by dying people who have deliberately avoided vaccines. Among 12- to 15-year-old children in England, the vaccination rate is 39.1% (compared with 80.4% of adults aged 18 and over who have had at least one dose, although the risk posed to children by Covid-19 is lower). But concerns associated with the arrival of the Omicron variant, against which the current vaccines may be less effective, make the issue of vaccine take-up more urgent – and the gaps more alarming. At a press conference led by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer, it was announced on Monday that children aged 12 to 15 would now be eligible to receive second doses 12 weeks after their initial jab. A decision on whether to vaccinate younger children is likely to be made before Christmas (in the US, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been approved for those aged five to 11). All adults will be offered boosters, where a fortnight ago these were mostly reserved for over-40s. Those with suppressed immune systems are also eligible for an additional (fourth) booster jab. Advice to pregnant women to get vaccinated has been belatedly strengthened. The purpose, as Prof Van-Tam and others have explained, is to try to “get ahead” of the mutating virus, and behave according to precautionary principles (around a dozen Omicron cases have been detected in the UK so far, with hundreds more expected). New rules about mask-wearing, including in secondary schools, are sensible in this context. Ventilation has been overlooked in the past and requires further attention. It is possible that the Omicron variant may turn out to be no more dangerous than the Delta variant. But ministers should seize this moment and use it to improve their vaccine messaging, starting with the prime minister himself. With vaccines now compulsory for care home workers, and causing problems where staff have left jobs rather than be jabbed, it is incumbent on senior politicians to set an example, allying themselves with scientists instead of the libertarians on their backbenches. They must also do more to combat vaccine misinformation online, both by demanding in public that Facebook and other platforms clamp down on the dangerous anti-vaxx propaganda that they allow to spread unchecked, but also by countering the lies with their own words and actions. The pandemic is not over. Once again, the level of danger may be on the rise. Along with delivering boosters, boosting the vaccination rate must now be the government’s domestic priority – while internationally, it should do everything it can to promote efforts to vaccinate the world. • This article was amended on 8 December 2021 to clarify that the vaccination rates given for 12- to 15-year-olds and for adults who had had at least one dose were for England only; and to correct the figure for the latter to 80.4%, not 67.4%, which was the figure for all people who had had at least one dose.",2021-11-29 19:07:23+00:00,134741,2
134810,commentisfree/2021/nov/29/england-covid-measures-clinically-vulnerable-masks,Opinion,England’s new Covid measures still leave clinically vulnerable people out in the cold | Frances Ryan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/29/england-covid-measures-clinically-vulnerable-masks,"Faux ruffled hair. Solemn tone. Boris Johnson’s emergency address this weekend about the new Omicron variant felt like a return to the old days of the pandemic. The measures announced, though, were hardly significant: for example, introducing mandatory masks in shops and on public transport only brings England in line with what the other home nations have long been doing, and hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants aren’t included in the new rules. This is far removed from the long discussed “plan B” – including working from home guidance and Covid passports – that some leading medics have been calling on ministers to implement for more than a month, but that is being resisted by Tory backbenchers. Perhaps most worryingly, protections for those most at risk from the virus, such as older and disabled people, were not even mentioned. There is no government advice as yet on how clinically vulnerable people are meant to live throughout the winter. Previously, 3.7 million clinically vulnerable people in England were asked to shield in their homes, and were given some government support to do so. Now they are effectively on their own, left to navigate having to go into the office, or meet friends at Christmas in a pub with no masking rules. Even before the discovery of the new variant, people with underlying health conditions were being widely ignored, despite case numbers remaining high. Months after the official shielding programme ended, Office for National Statistics data from October showed almost one in four clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people were still shielding, while 68% were leaving the house but taking extra precautions. Many CEV people tell me they’re bracing against the cold and only socialising outdoors, while others aren’t seeing loved ones at all. As one young man with cerebral palsy and asthma, who is not leaving his flat other than for vaccine appointments, told me: “I feel like a hamster on a wheel. If anything, the isolation of shielding is getting more entrenched than ever before by the rest of the population returning to ‘normal’.” Ministers have only made matters worse. Over the past few months, the government has removed many measures that would have helped clinically vulnerable people. In England, the legal requirement to wear a mask ended as far back as July, apart from in healthcare settings and care homes. Once furlough ended in October, clinically vulnerable people had fewer options to shield themselves. Many were sent back to packed offices or public-facing roles, without the legal right to work from home or still be paid if they couldn’t. Since August, close contacts of people in England who test positive for Covid haven’t had to self-isolate if they have been double-vaccinated. The government appears to have little interest in either preventing or tracking non-hospitalised Covid cases – a strategy that is dangerous to even vaccinated clinically vulnerable people in the UK, who must try to avoid contracting Covid in a population where 1 million people currently have the virus. The government clearly believes vaccines – and the booster programme in particular – can form its main line of defence, but while the rollout is providing huge relief, it is not a silver bullet. More than 100,000 extremely vulnerable people are yet to have their third jab after confusion over who is eligible. Medication or certain health problems mean two in five people who have impaired immune systems have a “low or undetectable” antibody response after being double vaccinated, meaning they in particular require a “vaccine plus” strategy – such as masks and increased distancing – to feel safer. The consequences of all this can’t be ignored: millions of people with underlying health conditions are being shut out from public life. The government’s new strategy is a step in the right direction, but to get through the winter and protect clinically vulnerable people we need to take further low-cost measures. Reintroducing “work from home if you can” guidance would have the biggest individual impact on reducing Covid transmission, according to scientists. There also needs to be greater support for workers who need to self-isolate. Statutory sick pay isn’t sufficient for people to pay their bills, while many insecure workers say they’re afraid they won’t be given hours in the future if they take time off to isolate. Unless the government provides better support, employees will turn up sick, increase transmission and infect vulnerable colleagues. There needs to be more focus on ventilation and regular lateral flow tests, particularly in schools and large venues. It makes little sense to bring back masks in shops, but not offices. But the real issue will likely be inspiring compliance. It is natural for pandemic fatigue to be setting in, and the government’s contradictory messaging has only compounded this. The same prime minister who was photographed without a mask in hospital now expects to command public trust on mandating them in Asda. There needs to be an emergency public health campaign, particularly over the high effectiveness of masks in reducing transmission. The public acted with solidarity early in the pandemic because the message was that measures would protect not only ourselves but others – there should be no reason why we can’t rediscover that sense of community. The government’s framing around “saving Christmas” suggests anyone who asks for more Covid measures now is the Grinch. But this is surely backwards thinking. As Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, puts it: Applied “correctly and consistently”, preventive measures “allow us to go on with our lives, not the opposite”. With rising cases in Europe resulting in new lockdowns, and the NHS facing its regular winter crisis, it’s long been in all of our interests to reduce transmission. It is a stain on Johnson’s government that it took the emergence of a new variant to spur the preventive action we already needed. Ministers have a duty to do more to protect the public this winter – and that includes clinically vulnerable people.

134840,commentisfree/2021/nov/29/developing-nations-wto-vaccine-patents-covid-britain,Opinion,Developing nations may give up on the WTO for good if it won’t budge on vaccine patents | Nick Dearden,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/29/developing-nations-wto-vaccine-patents-covid-britain,"Late on Friday, with only days to go until its 12th summit was due to commence, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that its most important meeting of the year couldn’t proceed. With alarm spreading about the Omicron Covid-19 variant, the WTO’s host country, Switzerland, closed its borders to southern Africa and introduced quarantine restrictions for visitors from Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong, where cases have been detected, making travel for many government delegations impossible. The summit, billed as critical for an institution in crisis, is now indefinitely postponed. The irony, not lost on many delegates from Africa, Asia and Latin America, is that global trade rules overseen by the WTO are actually at the heart of the dreadful situation the world is now confronting. Well over a year ago, India and South Africa called on the WTO to suspend part of an intellectual property agreement known as Trips, which allows pharmaceutical corporations to monopolise medical knowledge. Even though many Covid-19 vaccines and treatments were paid for from the public purse, Trips, the brainchild of a former big pharma executive, effectively means that the resulting medicines become the highly profitable property of a handful of the world’s biggest businesses. India and South Africa’s proposal is backed by pretty much every southern government. They are also joined, in a somewhat lacklustre manner, by the United States and a smattering of wealthy countries, who are at least prepared to countenance the need for radical action in the face of staggering levels of vaccine inequality. But the proposal is being blocked by Britain, Switzerland and the EU, defending big pharma and refusing to accept the need for change. These governments successfully grabbed as much of the limited supply of the vaccine doses as they could, achieved some of the highest vaccination rates in the world, and are now even throwing hundreds of thousands of doses in the bin. It’s no wonder that countries still struggling to vaccinate their frontline workers aren’t in the mood to be told “there’s really no problem, just wait a while longer”. The Omicron variant is the inevitable result of European strategy. Experts have been warning for months that failure to vaccinate most of the world is the best way to ensure the spread of new and potentially dangerous Covid-19 variants, some of which could undermine even the vaccines we have created. It is in this very real sense that none of us are safe until we’re all safe. But the WTO stands at the apex of a trade system which rules that nothing should get in the way of “the market”. An unhindered market is all we need, so the dogma goes, to get food to the hungry and medicine to the sick. Covid-19 is the proof that this is a fallacy. It has shown us that the market cannot solve a crisis. In fact, the market has ensured the rich and powerful get many times what they need while the poorest get virtually nothing. Meanwhile, two medicines alone – the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines – are making the companies behind them $1,000 (£749) per second in profit. Will Britain and other countries blocking the waiver learn their lesson now? Don’t hold your breath. If the WTO meeting had gone ahead, these countries would, in fact, have pushed a quite separate “solution” to the Covid-19 pandemic: more trade liberalisation and even more market freedoms. The measures they back include limiting export bans, lowering tariffs, promoting the deregulation and privatisation of services, and otherwise closing the space which countries have to respond to this or indeed future pandemics by making it harder for countries in the global south to nurture their own pharmaceutical industries. When the rules of the system have failed so badly, countries need more room to manoeuvre, not less. And while no one is arguing that export bans are the solution to a pandemic, in a context where rich countries are trying to grab vaccines from countries with much lower levels of protection, they can, unfortunately, be necessary. Just ask poorly vaccinated South Africa, which was forced to export Johnson & Johnson doses to a heavily vaccinated Europe. Or India, which sent millions of AstraZeneca doses to Britain even when it faced a catastrophic upsurge of cases itself.
If we want to recover from Covid-19, and approach the next pandemic better prepared, we need to share the knowhow behind essential medicines and build research, development and manufacturing capabilities around the world outside the control of big pharma. The WHO is trying to kick-start such a project in South Africa, reverse engineering Moderna’s vaccine so they can share it with the world. Far from helping these efforts, WTO rules are a major impediment. Across the board, whether on Covid-19 or agricultural policy, WTO rules have removed governments’ ability to protect their citizens, stretched supply chains to breaking point and undermined small producers. For many, the WTO’s legitimacy expired a long time ago. But the failure to agree a Trips waiver in the past 12 months is the final straw in the eyes of many African, Asian and Latin American governments. If the WTO fails to reform, they will simply have to begin doing things differently. The next steps should be clear. The WTO doesn’t need a physical meeting to recognise the disastrous failure of allowing the global marketplace to manage a pandemic. On Friday, President Biden spoke out again in favour of an intellectual property waiver, albeit one more limited than South Africa and India would like. Earlier in the day, Norway, a previous opponent of the proposal, said it was moving towards support. It’s time for free-market fundamentalists like Britain to move out of the way. If they don’t, the WTO’s time could finally be up. Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now",2021-11-29 12:00:01+00:00,134841,2
134983,commentisfree/2021/nov/28/omicron-covid-variant-britain-southern-africa,Opinion,How bad will the Omicron Covid variant be in Britain? Three things will tell us | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/28/omicron-covid-variant-britain-southern-africa,"Omicron, the name of the new Covid-19 variant that is sending worrying signals from southern Africa, sounds like something from Transformers. It has caused panic across the world, among governments, the public and the stock markets. After adding a number of southern African countries to the red list, the UK government has reimposed mandatory masks in England from Tuesday, and will require anyone travelling to the country from abroad to take a PCR test. Omicron is probably the first variant to have scientists worried since Delta became the predominant strain in every country last summer. But how bad is it? What does it mean for future lockdowns – and future deaths? Scientists are waiting on three pieces of data before they will be able to tell what effect this new variant will have over the next six to 12 months. The first is how infectious Omicron is. Can it outcompete Delta? Earlier this year we saw another worrying variant, Beta, that luckily faded away as a result of a selective advantage in Delta that allowed it to transmit faster between people. Limited data from South Africa shows that Omicron is very infectious, but whether it will become the predominant strain remains to be seen. The second thing scientists are waiting for is data showing the impact of this new variant on health outcomes – both in terms of hospitalisations and deaths. The reason governments impose lockdown measures is because hospitals fill up; limiting social mixing helps to slow the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on health services. In an optimistic scenario, Omicron may cause less severe disease and become more like the common cold. In a more realistic scenario, it could cause the same disease levels that we’ve seen with Alpha, Beta and Delta. The third and most concerning piece of data is the potential for Omicron to erode the immunity afforded by vaccines. Crucially, this wouldn’t necessarily mean that our current vaccines would stop working against Omicron. It would mean they would be less effective at stopping transmission – and, most worryingly, at stopping people from going into hospital and dying. This is based on a virological analysis of the sequencing of Omicron’s genome, and we don’t yet know the implications it will have in the real world. Companies such as BioNTech, which developed the Pfizer vaccine, are already trying to gauge the impact their vaccine will have on this variant.
So what does this mean for each of us? Right now, we need to continue to do all the things we should already be doing to get through the harsh winter months: getting vaccinated, and boosted, to protect ourselves; using the free home-testing kits to ensure we’re not infecting others, whether in friends’ homes or in pubs and restaurants; wearing masks in crowded places such as public transport and shops; and being attentive to how many close contacts we have. For governments, it means having to plan for several scenarios. The first (and best) would be that Omicron can’t outcompete Delta, or results in milder forms of the disease, or vaccine effectiveness remains high. The worst would be that an updated vaccine is urgently required (scientists could theoretically deliver one in a matter of weeks), followed by a massive vaccination campaign to get this variant-specific booster out to populations as quickly as possible. Governments have learned that it’s better to move earlier with precautionary measures rather than waiting and watching a crisis unfold. Scientists are increasingly cast in the role of “bad guys”; we’re the ones who convey difficult messages and uncertainty to the public, and are transparent on what we know and don’t know. Right now, everyone just wants Covid to be over and normal life to resume. Yet “when will this end?” is the wrong question to be asking – a more appropriate one is: “How do we manage this infectious disease in a more effective way so we get back more of our normal life?” Last winter was particularly bad. This winter will be bad, but not to the same degree. The hope is that by the spring, and definitely by next winter, we will be in a strong position to manage this disease through testing, vaccines and antiviral therapies. But, if nothing else, Omicron has shown that all humans on this planet are in the same boat (albeit in different cabins with differential access to vaccines), and the pandemic will only be over when it’s over in all parts of the world. Not just in Britain. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh",2021-11-28 15:40:29+00:00,134984,2
135051,commentisfree/2021/nov/28/scientists-sharing-omicron-date-were-heroic-lets-ensure-they-dont-regret-it,Opinion,Scientists sharing Omicron data were heroic. Let’s ensure they don’t regret it | Jeffrey Barrett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/28/scientists-sharing-omicron-date-were-heroic-lets-ensure-they-dont-regret-it,"One of the positive experiences during two years of pandemic gloom has been the speed of scientific progress in understanding and treating Covid. Many effective vaccines were launched in less than a year and rapid large-scale trials found a cheap and effective drug, dexamethasone, that saved thousands of lives. The global scientific community has also carried out “genomic surveillance” – sequencing the genome of the virus to track how it evolves and spreads at an unprecedented level: the public genome database has more than 5.5m genomes. The great value of that genomic surveillance, underpinned by a commitment to rapid and open sharing of the data by all countries in near-real time, has been seen in the last few days as we’ve learned of the Covid variant called Omicron. The surveillance requires a remarkable amount of cooperation between scientists to build compatible laboratory protocols, software systems and databases. Many of these scientists are not directly paid for this work and do it in addition to their existing jobs. They are motivated by a belief that sharing data relevant to public health, especially in a pandemic, can help speed up scientific understanding, aid in decision-making and contribute to the next generation of medicines. This commitment to rapid data sharing has deep roots in genomics. At a 1996 summit in Bermuda, the leaders of the Human Genome Project established a set of principles to release a new DNA sequence to public databases within 24 hours. This approach departed from the established convention that experimental data only needed to be released when a study was published, months or years later. Sir John Sulston, founding director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “All of this [genome data] should be in the public domain... I think we need a public social welfare attitude to the use of this information.” That attitude now prevails around the world, as evidenced by the rapid sharing of more than 1m Sars-CoV-2 sequences by the Sanger Institute since March 2020. On 23 November, scientists in Botswana uploaded 99 Sars-CoV-2 genome sequences to this database. Like most submissions that day, nearly all the sequences were the dominant Delta variant. But three of them looked different from anything seen before. Later the same day, an independent team in South Africa uploaded seven nearly identical genomes. These teams noticed that the new variant contained an eye-watering number of mutations in the part of the virus’s genome that encodes the spike protein, which it uses to infect human cells. Most concerningly, nearly half of these mutations had previously been seen in the earlier variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) or predicted in laboratory experiments to increase the virus’s ability to latch on to human cells. They notified health authorities of their concerns and began an immediate investigation into how widespread this new variant might be. While these scientists worked around the clock, the fact that they had shared the sequences with the world as part of their routine process, before they even knew what they were, meant that other scientists, thousands of miles away, could study them as well. Within just a few hours of the sequences being shared, a post was made on the pango designation forum, a corner of the internet where virus genome experts discuss new sequences and assign name that makes it easier to refer to specific parts of the Sars-CoV-2 family trees. The mutations in the new variant also alarmed the international scientists. It was quickly dubbed B.1.1.529 and prioritised for further study. Once additional evidence gathered by the local teams in South Africa had been presented, the World Health Organization (WHO) made it the fifth variant of concern, Omicron. Just 72 hours had passed since the original discovery.
The scientists who sounded the alarm because they are committed to the moral imperative of rapid data sharing knew that in the midst of the pandemic it would have consequences. Tulio de Oliveira, one of the leaders of the South African genomics team, announcing the variant, tweeted: “The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it! By protecting and supporting it, we will protect the world!” By the next day, dozens of countries, including the UK, had announced new travel restrictions on countries in southern Africa. Some restrictions may have been unavoidable to buy time to understand this new threat, but travel bans come with serious consequences for people and economies in affected countries. Previously, they have delayed, but not prevented, the spread of new variants. There is some chance in this situation that they may be more effective, precisely because of the excellent work done to share information so rapidly. Genomic surveillance in India when Delta appeared was less comprehensive and the seriousness of that new variant did not become apparent until weeks after it had been circulating widely, and exported around the world. While scientists around the world are scrambling to understand Omicron, and national governments are making response plans, we must also find ways to reward the critical early warning provided by South Africa. Less than 25% of South Africans are fully vaccinated, and while that may be due to complicated reasons involving both supply and demand, it is not for us in the rest of the world to determine what would be most helpful. Countries with an abundance of vaccine doses and other resources should offer whatever is asked for by countries now at the front edge of the confrontation with Omicron. The pandemic has emphasised that we are a single global community and our policy responses must reflect that reality. It would be a disaster if the global response to this heroically open science sent the message that the reward for such bravery is isolation. • Jeffrey Barrett is leading the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute",2021-11-28 09:00:21+00:00,135052,2

In the Home Office, this law is more prevalent than anywhere else. The tragedy of 27 deaths in the English Channel last week illustrates horribly how true this is. Some of my colleagues on the Conservative backbenches agree with the section of the public that believes the government is not being, in some undefined way, “tough enough” on the issue. This is palpably unfair on the home secretary in particular, and the government as whole. They want a solution as much as anyone for political as well as normal decent humanitarian reasons. There is no single act that works in this instance, but there are a series of options. These divide into short-term measures which should be implemented immediately, and more long-term plans which will take months and in some cases years to come to fruition, but will be needed to give a sustainable hope that this crisis will not be permanent.
For the immediate future, the only remedy lies on the beaches of northern France. The policing effort put in to stopping this activity, which is of course organised by some of the world’s nastiest criminal gangs preying on the most vulnerable people, may have been considerable, but it is not enough. For a start, the use of drones and other aerial surveillance would give the authorities a chance to know immediately where a particular operation was gathering, and therefore the ability to deploy police there in time. Whether this is done by French or British officers is a second-order issue. If the French police don’t have the resources, the UK can and will help out. Both countries already allow each other’s immigration officers to check passports on the other side of the Channel, so this is legally possible. Sovereignty should not be an issue here. What this would require is a greater willingness to act together than is currently available. The wider background of Anglo-French coldness, which is currently severe and getting worse, needs to be reversed, in the interests of both countries. The last couple of days have been a diplomatic disaster. Now is not the time for displays of wounded amour propre, in either language. Careless talk costs lives. For the longer term, the idea of adapting the Syrian scheme, where refugees came to Britain legally from the area to which they had originally fled, is a good one. There is no reason why this cannot be applied to other countries suffering turmoil and would provide the other side to the coin of new restrictions on illegal entry in the borders bill currently before parliament. It would demonstrate that the UK was not shirking its responsibilities as a global player and would therefore justify tighter rules in terms of refusing entry to those who were trying to break or ignore the existing laws of the country. This kind of strategy, which combines a realistic and compassionate approach around the world with greater protection of our own borders, will be needed. Most importantly it will save lives, but it will also lower the political temperature around immigration more generally. It will also be needed because of a fact that I almost hesitate to point out to more delicately minded Observer readers. This is that Britain – post-Brexit, Tory-voting Britain, Boris’s Britain – is a greatly attractive place to live. People who have reached France or other prosperous western democracies are still desperate to come to the UK. Because we live here too, we don’t want that desirability to change. So let’s have an asylum system that can cope.

135082,commentisfree/2021/nov/28/observer-view-on-omicron-variant,Opinion,The Observer view on the Omicron variant | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/28/observer-view-on-omicron-variant,"Scientists have always warned that the biggest risk to the UK at this stage of the pandemic is the emergence of a more infectious, virulent and vaccine-resistant variant of the virus. It remains to be seen whether Omicron, the new variant of concern identified by the World Health Organization last week is that. But the structure of Omicron – the number of concerning mutations in its spike protein – and the preliminary evidence that there is an increased risk of reinfection with this variant have rightly prompted a global response to try and contain its spread as much as possible. It will be weeks before we understand just how much a risk Omicron presents. If it is much more infectious than the Delta variant of Covid, its global spread is to some degree inevitable, though it will of course be slowed by vaccines and travel restrictions. It is a relief that the government acted far more promptly to impose travel restrictions on South Africa and other affected countries than it did in the case of Delta and India, where a delay of weeks undoubtedly contributed to the speed at which Delta became the dominant variant here in the UK. But it is concerning that the government has not been testing all arrivals from South Africa in recent days in the same way as, for example, the Dutch government has. The emergence of Omicron should serve as a reminder of some key lessons in this pandemic. The first is the importance of genomic sequencing, which tracks the genetic structure of the virus. Omicron was spotted early thanks to South Africa’s huge investment in sequencing, which has allowed swift action to be taken. This could be valuable in terms of developing updated vaccines if needed. But this action takes the form of punishing travel bans, so there is a case for South Africa receiving global compensation in order not to disincentivise countries with similar sequencing capabilities from being transparent about their findings. Second, as highlighted yet again by former prime minister Gordon Brown in the Guardian last week, Omicron is a reminder that no one is safe until everyone is safe. By the end of the year, enough vaccines will have been manufactured to have vaccinated the whole world against Covid. Yet too many countries are facing this winter with low vaccination rates as a result of wealthier nations hoarding unused supplies. Only 3% of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated, compared with more than 60% in high-income countries. This gap is not only ethically wrong – it increases the likelihood of a vaccine-resistant strain developing. High-income countries need to develop far more efficient and timely systems for delivering unused vaccinations to developing countries well in advance of their expiry date. Third, the importance of the precautionary principle has been proved over and again in this pandemic. With a virus that spreads so rapidly, less restriction action sooner can prevent the need for more restrictive action for longer later. Britain’s vaccination programme has been a success and means that unless we see another more vaccine-resistant variant, whether that is Omicron or another, we should be able to avoid the sorts of invasive lockdowns that were required in the first and second waves. The government was right yesterday to introduce stricter requirements around travel, self-isolation for those who have been in contact with Omicron and compulsory mask wearing in shops. As we have argued throughout the pandemic, it needs to boost sick pay in order to ensure people with symptoms can afford to take the time off work to self-isolate if they test positive. Clive Dix, the former chair of the vaccine taskforce, has sounded the alarm about the government’s lack of preparedness for a vaccine-resistant variant, as we report today. Hopefully, Omicron will prove to be less of a risk than some fear. But if so, we should treat it as a lucky escape. It is a warning that this pandemic is far from over and that the UK and other rich nations should be doing more to combat the spread of the virus in other parts of the world.",2021-11-28 06:30:18+00:00,135083,2
135090,commentisfree/2021/nov/28/trump-covid-red-state-america-blue-anti-vaxxers-robert-reich,Opinion,Trump stoked Covid in red states – but there are blue anti-vaxxers too | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/28/trump-covid-red-state-america-blue-anti-vaxxers-robert-reich,"Is there a relationship between Covid and politics? Sure seems so.
By the end of October, 25 out of every 100,000 residents of counties Donald Trump won by wide margins had died from Covid. That was more than three times higher than the Covid death rate in heavily Biden counties, of 7.8 per 100,000. Counties where Trump received at least 70% of the vote had an even higher average Covid death toll than counties where Trump won at least 60%. Presumably, this is because Trump counties also have the highest unvaccinated rates in the US. Almost every reliably blue state now has a higher vaccination rate than almost every reliably red state. There are some obvious reasons why Trump voters have been hesitant to get vaccinated. Trump politicized the issue – making the jab a hallmark of his peculiar form of rightwing populism. He and Fox News spread false rumors and conspiracy theories about the vaccine. By the time Trump finally called on people to get vaccinated, the damage was already done. In other words, it’s the same trifecta of rightwing media, inadequate education and rejection of science that gave us Trump in the first place. But this isn’t the whole story, because the US as a whole trails every other advanced country in the rate of vaccinations. Why? In recent weeks I’ve discovered that several anti-vaxxers live around me – in the bluest region of the bluest county of the bluest state in America. I’ve known several for years. They are well-informed and well-educated. But they’re as opposed to getting a shot as any Trump anti-vaxxer. Some are ex-hippies, now in their late 60s and early 70s, who regard their bodies as “sacred” and don’t want anything or anyone to “invade” it. One, who grows her own food and lives by herself in a cabin not far from here, told me she didn’t want anything going into her body that she didn’t control. When I asked whether she had been vaccinated against smallpox, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, she told me she assumed so but had been too small to have had knowledge or control. Others – also in their late 60s and early 70s – don’t trust big pharma. They see Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson as greedy global corporations in search of people to exploit and tax havens to park their exorbitant profits. “Why in hell would I trust a fucking thing Pfizer says or does?” one of them asked me. None of these people trusts the government. Their generation (which is also mine) came to political consciousness during the Vietnam war – a time when the American flag became an emblem of fascism, particularly in lefty coastal enclaves. They now believe the government has been so corrupted by big money that they don’t trust agencies charged with protecting the public. I’m sympathetic to their distrust of both big pharma and big government. But this doesn’t mean the science is wrong. One of them referred me to a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association which found that about a third of the drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2001 and 2010 had safety problems after reaching the market. I checked and he’s correct. But he left out a critical fact: as soon as the FDA discovered the problems it forced manufacturers to pull the drugs or issue warnings. Deep down, I think these blue anti-vaxxers are motivated by something different from mere distrust. When I pointed out that they could well be endangering others (including me), they remained unmoved. When I suggested that their concerns, however valid, had to be weighed against the public’s overall interest in conquering this epidemic, they said they didn’t care. My conclusion: They’re infected not by Covid but by a narcissism that refuses even to consider the risks and costs they’re imposing on others.
I can’t say for sure that Trump anti-vaxxers share this narcissism, although the leader of their cult surely does. And, of course, my sample size was so small I can’t even generalize to all blue anti-vaxxers. If we blame Trump and the culture that produced him for the relatively low rate of vaccinations in the US, we’re missing a character trait that may offer a fuller explanation. This trait is found among Democrats and independents in blue America as well as Republicans in Trumpland. In fact, I think it’s been near the core of the American personality since before the founding of the nation – a stubborn, selfish, me-first individualism.

135303,commentisfree/2021/nov/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-b11529-covid-variant-caution-needed,Opinion,The Guardian view on the Omicron variant: caution needed | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-b11529-covid-variant-caution-needed,"Hearts are sinking. Many had hoped the worst of the pandemic was over, enjoying a return to quasi-normality despite warnings that this winter could prove punishing. Now Covid cases are surging across Europe; rates are rising in the UK again after a half-term dip; and the new Omicron variant detected in South Africa is ringing alarm bells across the world. At present we have a limited understanding of how much of a threat this variant poses, though the World Health Organization has classified it “of concern”. The fear is that its multiple mutations – 32 on its spike protein, the key it uses to unlock our body’s cells – could mean antibodies from previous infections or vaccination may not counter it so well. Scientists are also looking at its interaction with another aspect of the immune system: T-cells. A surge of cases in South Africa’s Gauteng province is increasing anxiety about its transmissibility. We do not yet know whether it may cause more severe disease. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser of the UK Health Security Agency, described it as “the most worrying we’ve seen”, while the health secretary, Sajid Javid, warned: “It may be more transmissible than the Delta variant and current vaccines may be less effective against it. It may also impact the effectiveness of one of our major treatments.” This is the case for swift action – even if it ultimately proves unnecessary. We have repeatedly seen that precautionary actions have relatively low economic and social costs and can easily be scaled back, while a delayed reaction costs lives and increases the risk that severe restrictions will be needed – as last winter. The question is which measures are appropriate. Though the UK and others have halted flights from several southern African countries, the variant has already spread beyond them: Belgium announced one case on Friday; Israel has found at least three. Some feel that cutting off transport links is simply punishing South Africa for its expertise and transparency, in finding and disclosing a variant which may have originated elsewhere, and suspect that action would have been slower had the variant emerged in Europe or the US. But while suspending travel cannot stop the variant’s spread, some believe it may buy precious time to get more doses into arms, improve public awareness and introduce stronger disease control measures. That time should be used wisely. Mandatory masking should never have been a plan B; the government should reintroduce it now, along with vaccine passports for large events and adequate financial support for the sick or isolating. At the same time, South Africa and neighbouring nations must be given all the support they need. In poorer countries, people will be additionally susceptible due to malnourishment, existing health problems, overcrowded conditions and healthcare systems that already fail to meet their basic needs. This variant is a powerful reminder that failing to distribute vaccines equitably is a failure not only of ethics but of self-protection: the more the virus circulates, the greater the risk of new variants. South Africa, Botswana and others have long called for the waiving of intellectual property rights on Covid vaccines, tests and treatments. Though the US has backed that call, the EU, UK and others still hold out – while the west fails to share existing doses. South Africa’s current problem is not one of supply but of vaccine rollout, with a high degree of vaccine scepticism. But its delayed start did not help, and other African nations with much lower rates of vaccination are still struggling to obtain doses. Though the pandemic is far from over, it will end one day; and though humans cannot determine its course, our actions do have an impact upon it. The dedication of scientists, medical staff and other key workers has mitigated its worst aspects. The rest of us must do our part too.",2021-11-26 18:43:42+00:00,135304,2
135350,commentisfree/2021/nov/26/new-variant-covid-b11529-testing-masks-vaccines,Opinion,The new variant is worrying – but it doesn’t change how we tackle Covid | Kit Yates,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/26/new-variant-covid-b11529-testing-masks-vaccines,"Many of the world’s leading Covid-19 experts are raising the alarm about a new variant which has been described as “horrific” and “the worst ever”. Authorities are understandably worried. But it’s important to place their concerns in context. We have detected variants before that looked worrying but never took off. It’s early days for a variant that wasn’t on anyone’s radar until only last week. Much about the new variant is still unknown. The very fact we have detected this new variant early is good news, and shows that the global surveillance system is working. But the high number of mutations detected in its genome are concerning. This is the primary reason scientists around the world are warning it must be taken seriously. Every time a virus replicates, it has the opportunity to mutate. The more opportunities the virus has to replicate, the larger the number of mutations, and the higher the chances of new variants emerging – that much is simple mathematics. Most mutations will go unnoticed and have a neutral or negative impact on the resulting virus. Occasionally we will see mutations that fundamentally change the nature of the virus and what it is able to do. There are typically three things that dictate how worried we should be about an emerging variant: does it spread faster? Is it more deadly? And does it evade our existing immunity? We are still at the beginning of the race to understand this new variant, B.1.1.529, which was first detected in southern Africa. But if the answer to any of these questions is yes, then it could be a serious threat – and we will need to do whatever we can to limit its spread. Based on preliminary data, this variant seems to be out-competing other variants, growing faster even than Delta, which quickly rose to global dominance earlier this year. This assessment is based on a small numbers of cases in South Africa, and there is still a great degree of uncertainty over how transmissible it is. Some of the mutations that B.1.1.529 has acquired have been previously associated with higher transmissibility in other variants. This has scientists worried about its ability to spread. Beyond the relatively limited case data, the small number of sequenced genomes are perhaps a bigger cause for concern, due to the sheer number of mutations that have been discovered in this new variant. As well as mutations associated with increased transmission, some of the mutations in B.1.1.529 have been associated with changes to the spike protein that might make it unrecognisably different to the version of Covid our vaccines were designed to target. This potential for immune evasion is the most worrying aspect of all. It’s why nations are currently scrambling to prevent the variant from arriving on their shores. Despite being among the first countries to limit travel from southern Africa, Israel has already found a case of the new variant in a traveller returning from the region. Whether this will tip over into community spread remains to be seen, but Israel is taking few chances: it has already quarantined two other returning travellers who are suspected to be infected with the variant. The new variant is also believed to have reached Europe, with Belgium confirming the continent’s first case. As the situations in Israel and Belgium demonstrate, it is possible that the variant is already here in the UK. As of yet, no cases have been detected. The government has reacted quickly, placing Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe on England’s red travel list. Managed hotel quarantine, however, does not come into force until Sunday, and arrivals between now and then are asked to undertake the less reliable measure of isolating at home. And even with managed isolation from listed countries in place, there are still concerns about the variant being imported from countries that aren’t on the red list, where it has spread but not yet been detected. The potential for loopholes, including people travelling via a third country in order to bypass quarantine measures, also presents a possible route for the new variant to spread. These loopholes need to be tightened quickly. Moreover, if and when the variant starts spreading among people in the country, we will need enhanced contact testing and tracing – including the testing of those who have come into contact someone who is Covid-positive before or after their infection was detected . This would help to stamp out potential outbreaks as they emerge. Surge testing should also be on standby in case the variant is found to be spreading in the community.
The new variant doesn’t change the fundamentals of how the UK should be tackling Covid. We should still be encouraging people to get the vaccine and their booster shots. As the winter draws in and people spend more time socialising indoors, we need to focus on better ventilation in communal spaces. We should be taking mitigation measures to prevent spread in schools, where pupils are again seeing the highest rates of Covid among any age group. We should be updating our messaging on Covid symptoms so that people know when to get tested, and we should be redoubling our efforts to get in touch with close contacts of infected people so they know to get a test themselves. Masks should be made mandatory again in enclosed public spaces, on transport and in supermarkets, and businesses should be encouraging people to work from home where they can. In short, we must be doing all the things that we should have been doing all along to prevent the spread of Covid-19. What the emergence of this new and potentially dangerous variant highlights more than ever is that we, in the UK, are not immune to Covid in other countries. It doesn’t make sense for the UK government to talk about being first to exit the pandemic. By its very definition, the pandemic is a global problem that will only truly be solved with global solutions. Worldwide vaccinations will be vital in order to reduce Covid cases around the world and limit the potential for novel variants that could undo all our hard work. Up to this point, rich nations have not been doing enough to achieve this goal. The emergence of this new variant reinforces the message that should have always been the overriding mantra of our pandemic response: nowhere is safe until everywhere is safe.

135353,commentisfree/2021/nov/26/new-covid-variant-rich-countries-hoarding-vaccines,Opinion,A new Covid variant is no surprise when rich countries are hoarding vaccines | Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/26/new-covid-variant-rich-countries-hoarding-vaccines,"Despite the repeated warnings of health leaders, our failure to put vaccines into the arms of people in the developing world is now coming back to haunt us. We were forewarned – and yet here we are. In the absence of mass vaccination, Covid is not only spreading uninhibited among unprotected people but is mutating, with new variants emerging out of the poorest countries and now threatening to unleash themselves on even fully vaccinated people in the richest countries of the world. On Thursday, the UK’s Department of Health, which has placed a travel ban on southern Africa, warned that the B.1.1.529 “Omicron” variant was the most “complex” and “worrying” seen so far. And yet with 9.1bn vaccines already manufactured and 12bn expected by the year’s end – enough to vaccinate the whole world – this was the “arms race” that we could have won. No country should be facing yet another winter with the uncertainty of a new wave of Covid hanging over us. On Monday, the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, will meet in a special session. They will hear that vaccination rates in the six countries now subject to UK travel bans are still dangerously below the 40% target that was set for December. In Zimbabwe, only 25% have had a first vaccine and just 19% of the population are fully vaccinated. In Lesotho and Eswatini, which have had the Johnson and Johnson single-shot vaccines, just 27% and 22% respectively have been vaccinated. In Namibia the figure is even lower: 14% vaccinated with only 12% fully vaccinated. While South Africa has achieved 27% vaccination rates, its rural areas are often in single figures, and the whole of the continent is justifiably angry because their own efforts to vaccinate have been impeded for months by the neo-colonialism of the European Union. Even as the gap between the vaccines haves of Europe and the vaccine have-nots of Africa mushroomed, the EU insisted on commandeering millions of South African-produced Johnson & Johnson one-shot vaccines and sending them out of Africa into Europe. In June, Boris Johnson promised he and the G7 countries would use their surplus vaccines to immunise the whole world. In September, at a summit chaired by President Biden, a December target of 40% vaccination was set for the 92 poorest countries. Two and a half months on, there is little chance of this target being met in at least 82 of them. By Thursday the US, which to its credit has been responsible for half the vaccines donated, had still delivered only 25% of the vaccines that it promised. The arithmetic of failure in the rest of the world is even more embarrassing. According to Airfinity, the European Union has delivered only 19%, the UK just 11% and Canada just 5%. China and New Zealand have delivered over half of what was promised, but their pledges amounted to just 100m and 1.6m respectively. Australia has given just 18% of what it offered and Switzerland just 12%. The result is that even now only 3% of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated, while the figure exceeds 60% in both high-income countries and upper-middle-income countries. Every day, for every vaccine delivered as first vaccines in the poorest countries, six times as many doses are being administered as third and booster vaccines in the richest parts of the world. This vaccine inequality is the main reason why the WHO is predicting 200 million more cases on top of the 260 million so far. And after 5 million deaths to Covid, another 5 million are thought to be possible in the next year and more. What’s most galling is that this policy failure is not because we are short of vaccines or manufacturing contracts to secure them. The problem is not now in production (2 billion doses of vaccine are being manufactured every month), but in the unfairness of distribution. The stranglehold exercised by the G20 richest countries is such that they have monopolised 89% of vaccines, and even now, 71% of future deliveries are scheduled for them. As a result, the global vaccine distribution agency, Covax, has been able to secure only two-thirds of the 2bn vaccines promised to poorer countries. The good news is that our medical genius has ensured that the new Omicron variant has been identified quickly; is being sequenced at speed; and, if it proves not only more transmissible but immune to current vaccines, a new vaccine could potentially soon emerge. But given the contrast between the success of our scientists and the failure of our global leaders, only a herculean effort starting this week can allay fears that new mutations among unvaccinated people in the least-protected places will take Covid into a third year – with even fifth, sixth and seventh waves. We can act quickly. As of today, 500m unused vaccines are available across the G7. By December, the figure will rise to 600m, and by February, it will be 850m vaccines, which can be sent to the countries in greatest need. At the last count, the US has 162m vaccine doses it could immediately deliver to the rest of the world, a figure that grows to 250m next month; Europe currently has even more: 250m, which by February could exceed 350m. The UK has 33m vaccines – expected to rise to 46m over the next three months. The alternative is too awful to contemplate; vaccines are being destroyed while lives are being lost through lack of them. According to the data research agency Covax, around 100m of western countries’ vaccines will pass their use-by dates in December and could easily go to waste. Of course, there will be issues of absorption in Africa, but the bigger problem is that too many of the vaccines gifted to the poorest countries are within 12 weeks of their “use-by-dates”. These short lead times between donation and expiry show why a strengthened G20 and a month-to-month delivery timetable is now urgent; and why the expeditious transferring of delivery dates, from rich to poor countries – as has happened with Switzerland’s recent transfer to Covax – is the best way of speeding up the transfer of unused vaccines to where they are needed most. Nothing so dramatically illustrates the urgent need for what might be called a pandemic non-proliferation treaty . A new and binding international agreement that the World Health Assembly will consider next week must improve our surveillance and early warning systems, ensure the early transfer of medical supplies to countries in need, and finally agree sufficient funding of a worldwide effort to deliver what is clearly the most important global public good of all: cross-border control of infectious disease. Only when we reject vaccine nationalism and medical protectionism will we stop outbreaks becoming pandemics.

136113,commentisfree/2021/nov/23/unvaccinated-people-boosters-covid-jab,Opinion,Getting jabs to the unvaccinated has never been more critical | Andrew Pollard and Brian Angus,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/23/unvaccinated-people-boosters-covid-jab,"More than ever before, we must look behind the reported Covid-19 numbers in hospitals and communities to understand what is happening in the pandemic. We also need to better understand how the pandemic is playing out among unvaccinated people, and those who have been vaccinated. To the public, the pandemic was and still is a silent pestilence, made visible by the images of patients fighting for their next breath and reporters at intensive care units talking about the fear of patients and the exhaustion of doctors and nurses from behind their fogged visors. This ongoing horror, which is taking place in ICUs across Britain, is now largely restricted to unvaccinated people. Generally, Covid-19 is no longer a disease of the vaccinated; vaccines tend to limit this suffocating affliction, with a few exceptions. If the protection that vaccines offer against severe Covid-19 began to wane, given that tens of millions of people are now vaccinated in the UK and only a fraction of the population have not received the jab, ICUs would be filled to the brim with vaccinated people. But they are not. Vaccines still seem to give almost complete protection against this form of life-threatening cases of Covid-19. The latest wave of the virus in the UK – with cases rising rapidly in parts of Europe – will directly translate into a stream of mostly unvaccinated patients entering ICU. In the short term, boosters and social restrictions will help prevent Covid-19 from spreading among people who are unvaccinated this winter. But in the long run, the pressure of Covid-19 on ICUs won’t be solved through these measures. The virus will eventually reach unvaccinated people. To prevent serious illness, these people need first and second doses of the vaccine as soon as possible. It is therefore obvious that governments with doses to spare should be making every effort to ensure vaccines urgently reach people who are undecided and unvaccinated. Some countries are already hoping to drive uptake among this group by imposing social restrictions or introducing vaccine mandates. But understanding and dealing with people’s underlying objections to vaccinations would be a visionary project to secure the public’s health, during the pandemic and beyond. In countries with lower vaccination rates, the impact of the current wave on hospital ICUs will be far worse than in Britain. As a proportion of the whole population, vaccination coverage in the UK is 69%, but in Bulgaria it is only 24% and in Slovakia 43%. It is also important to address pockets of unvaccinated people in countries where vaccine uptake is otherwise high. In the US, for example, fewer than 50% of people have received both jabs in certain states. In other states, the rate is 70%.
In this context, it is shameful that in some low-income countries only 5% of the population have received at least one dose, almost a year since the first licensed dose was given in Britain. The director general of the World Health Organization expressed his deep concern last week that there are now six times more booster doses being administered every day than first doses. We are still not doing enough to end the pandemic for the world’s unvaccinated, and governments and manufacturers urgently need to work together to get doses to those in low-income countries, keeping an eye on the long-term gains of global vaccination, despite the challenges posed by the current Covid spike in Europe. For those of us fortunate enough to have already been vaccinated, the story now seems very different. For the most part, we are protected from very severe cases of Covid-19. But it is now clear that even the fully vaccinated can get mild infection with the virus: the effectiveness of two-dose vaccines against mild symptomatic infection now ranges from 44% to 63%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This lower level of protection is partly a feature of waning immunity against mild infection. It’s also a result of the Delta variant, which is better at infecting people than its predecessors, even when they have vaccine immunity. For most vaccinated individuals, these mild infections are little more than an unpleasant inconvenience. But for those who are very frail, immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions, these infections are enough to destabilise them and lead to hospital admissions, which is what happens every winter with other viruses, including flu. For some, these are serious, life-threatening health problems that add to the pressure on the NHS. But this situation is not the same as the one we faced last year. It’s also worth remembering that while daily hospital admission data includes people with Covid-19, these numbers may also include people admitted for an unrelated illness, an accident or indeed for elective surgery who happened to have tested positive for Covid. It is difficult to know the true burden of disease in hospitals when the background rate of infection in the community continues to be high. Booster doses drive up the antibody levels that are needed to prevent infection. According to recent figures from the UKHSA, they appear to increase protection against Covid-19 to at least 93%. As a consequence, they will help to drive down the number of Covid-19 cases in the community, and reduce the chance that milder infection will occur among vulnerable people that result in hospital admissions. In highly vaccinated regions where the supply of doses is not limited, this is good news. But we don’t yet know how long this boost to protection will last. We need better and cleaner clinical data to understand fully which patients are being admitted to hospital, to improve our assessment of how effective vaccines are at preventing hospital and ICU admission, and to assess who would be most likely to benefit from boosters. It is also important to monitor and assess the duration of the top-up protection afforded by boosters to then inform the best long-term strategy for future control beyond this winter. What this means for people who are vaccinated is that we have our first glimpses of what “living with the virus” might look like, though it will be some time before it is clear where or when this will all level out. There are still questions over whether we will need regular boosters, and who these should target. But the horrors of the pandemic continue unabated for the unvaccinated, who remain at risk wherever in the world they live. We have to do better at delivering first doses to these people by addressing the unequal access to vaccines across the world, and the barriers that exist to vaccine acceptance among some communities.

136231,commentisfree/2021/nov/22/austria-vaccine-mandates-europe-unvaccinated,Opinion,Austria is showing that vaccine mandates are no longer unthinkable | Liam Hoare,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/22/austria-vaccine-mandates-europe-unvaccinated,"In the past few weeks, Austria has hit many new Covid-19 records – none of them good. On 18 November there were 15,145 new cases recorded, the largest number seen since the pandemic began. And the seven-day average for new confirmed cases per 100,000 people is at 1,395, more than double the rates in countries such as Germany, France and the UK. On Friday the Austrian chancellor, Alexander Schallenberg, announced the country’s fourth national lockdown, beginning today and lasting between 10 and 20 days. This makes Austria only the second European country, after Latvia, to impose lockdown measures since vaccines became widely available earlier this year. Going even further, Schallenberg announced that Austria would also be the first in Europe to bring in compulsory vaccination beginning on 1 February 2022.
Schallenberg and his health minister, Wolfgang Mückstein, had previously said that lockdown measures would return only for the unvaccinated. They hoped this might be enough to bring the vaccination rate up and case numbers down. While the percentage of Austrians in receipt of first doses has crept up to 69%, from below 60% at the beginning of August, once intensive care units in the states of Upper Austria and Salzburg became full, another nationwide lockdown became inevitable. And a vaccine mandate – once an unthinkable option – has been broached. Public discussion about a vaccine mandate began over the summer. But the former chancellor Sebastian Kurz resisted the idea, preferring to rely on appeals to responsibility and individual choice. By the summer’s end, however, the country seemed to have stalled at “max vax”, and its share of the population fully vaccinated against Covid-19 had fallen behind the EU average. How a broad vaccine mandate could be enforced remains unclear – though non-compliance could mean a fine of as much as £3,000, cabinet minister Karoline Edtstadler has said – and it may be liable to challenge on constitutional grounds either at the domestic or European level. Recent opinion polling indicates a slim majority in Austria in support of a vaccine mandate. When asked to choose between a potpourri of possible Covid-19 countermeasures, 41% of Austrians plumped for compulsory vaccination – the most popular measure ahead of a lockdown, nightly curfew and vaccine mandate for particular professions. And 53% of viewers of the news channel Puls24 said they favoured a vaccine mandate, with 44% against. But while a majority of citizens may actually support a mandate, Austrian society is deeply divided between those who have accepted vaccination measures thus far, and a hardened, unvaccinated residuum caught up in conspiracy theories and false information, and attracted to far-right politics. On Saturday, demonstrations in Vienna against the new lockdown and mandate announcements attracted 40,000 people, according to police estimates. Convicted neo-Nazi Gottfried Küssel and identitarian leader Martin Sellner were among those taking part. Several demonstrators wore yellow Stars of David or carried placards that compared the mandate to the Holocaust. Austria’s low vaccination rate and lashings of anti-vax and Covid-sceptic sentiment are reflected in its party politics. Austria has not one but two openly Covid-sceptic parties: the Freedom party (FPÖ) and a new movement, the People-Freedom-Fundamental Rights (MFG) party, which won representation in the Upper Austrian state parliament in regional elections in September. The FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl – prone to throwing about terms such as “vaccine apartheid” and “two-class society” – has promoted the horse deworming drug ivermectin as a treatment. Kickl makes a point of his unvaccinated status, and last week revealed that he had tested positive for Covid-19.
But there are also particular political, geographical and cultural differences that account for Austria’s relatively low rate of Covid-19 vaccination. The government encouraged but never at any point attempted to force the hand of the unvaccinated. This was particularly evident during the September elections in Upper Austria, where the unvaccinated formed a large pool of potential voters and a vaccine mandate was perceived to be a vote-losing issue, a hill on which no party wished to die. There are particularly low rates of jab uptake in more isolated and disconnected rural areas and less affluent, outer districts of Vienna in which the proportion of residents born outside Austria is larger. It is also worth noting that Austrians use alternative medicines, from homeopathy to home remedies, much more than in Britain. The health minister, for one, is a GP and a qualified practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. Though Austria’s public insurance-based system produces better health outcomes than the NHS, it is not revered in the same way. Austria has been a harbinger of European Covid-19 policy before. On 8 November, in a vain attempt to bring the case numbers under control, it introduced a so-called “2G” rule at venues such as restaurants, cinemas and gyms, meaning only those who had been double-jabbed or had recovered from Covid-19 in the previous six months could enter. Where Austria led, others followed, including many German states. Nations that continue to struggle with outbreaks and stubbornly low vaccination rates will be watching Austria’s vaccine mandate rollout closely, possibly as a roadmap of things to come.

Apart from a few necessary work events and trips to (vaccinated and tested) friends’ houses, I’ve stayed at home ever since. Coming from a huge New Zealand family, Christmas for me is all about people. I love summer and swimming, and my partner is always surprised by just how much energy I have for socialising in our extrovert v introvert relationship. But when the New South Wales government opened up on the 15th, my world closed down. I have rheumatoid arthritis and a few other autoimmune diseases, so I am on medications that leave me immunocompromised. And the science was clear: with my vaccines completed in early August, I had considerably reduced protection from Omicron.
The last two years have been tough. At the start of 2020, I was living in a sharehouse in Sydney’s Newtown, working in theatre and film, and spending as much time as possible in the US with my partner. When Covid first broke, I wrote an opinion piece about my anger at society’s complacency around the deaths of those in the disability community. It still stings when Covid-related deaths are prefaced with a caveat about “underlying health conditions” – because that is what I have, and I love my life. Just after that article was written I moved out of my beloved share-home, put all my belongings, bar two suitcases, into storage, and moved back to Aotearoa for five months. I never did get to direct that show in Canada, my Sydney Film Festival debut was online, and I didn’t see my partner for more than a year. Lockdown sucks. I get it. But I’m alive. And that’s no small thing. Around 60% of the 148,000 people who died in the UK were part of the disability community. In the United States, where 1 in every 500 people have died, those with underlying health conditions were four times more likely to lose their lives.
Living with an underlying health condition during the pandemic has been incredibly difficult. Despite government claims that people at risk would be prioritised for vaccination, my health providers didn’t know when or how I could get vaccinated, leaving me and many others to roam government websites searching for an appointment. I was eventually allocated to an inner-city hospital with a very low vaccine supply, and I wasn’t able to change this allocation. While I spent hours in vain calling the vaccine hotline begging for a new and earlier appointment anywhere in Sydney, friends my age without health conditions were able to book and get vaccinated before me. I am educated, articulate, mobile and can advocate for myself; it’s troubling to consider how others in the disability community navigated the system without these privileges. Eventually I travelled to Aotearoa again where common sense seemed to prevail: I was finally able to get vaccinated within a few weeks and stayed out of Sydney, my home, for another four months. Despite government promises, Australia moved out of lockdown before vaccine rates for many at-risk communities reached the levels set for the broader community, in what I think is a careless and avoidable decision. The way the Perrottet government has managed the transition from lockdown has been nothing short of bizarre. Ending mask mandates, capacity limits and QR registrations just as a new strain of Covid was hitting, vaccine immunity was waning, and boosters were yet to be rolled out was always going to be the disaster we are currently facing. At the same time, I’m so disappointed by the rhetoric of our state and federal leaders of “personal responsibility”. Wearing a mask is more than an individual protection. It is an act of solidarity and community care. It acknowledges that you have no idea who might be vulnerable around you and that you value the health of others. To not wear a mask is not an act of freedom; it is callous.
Focusing on “personal responsibility” during a pandemic is an elitist and ableist luxury. It also doesn’t work. Beyond personal protection, vaccination availability and acceptance is about community protection. Vaccinations only work when they are available to everyone, creating herd immunity across the community. Furthermore, without financial support, most of us, including people with underlying conditions, need to leave our homes to work and live, even as it becomes increasingly difficult to get any Covid test, let alone one without out-of-pocket costs. Again, our politicians have let us down. More than 18 months after my previous article, I was asked as a woman with disability about how I am feeling about Covid and the end of lockdowns. But my lockdown has not ended; it will continue until there is a coherent plan from our leaders that doesn’t leave people with disability behind. I feel undervalued and forgotten. I feel that my life is seen as less important that those without disability. Ironically, we may well be creating a new generation of people with disability and illness – a new generation with underlying health conditions – through the impacts of long Covid. I hope we treat these people better in the future than we are treating people with disability today. • Anthea Williams is a theatre and film director",2021-12-31 05:51:03+00:00,136587,2
136639,commentisfree/2021/dec/30/running-out-covid-tests-strategy-flawed,Opinion,Of course England is running out of Covid tests – the strategy is a flawed one | Azeem Majeed,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/30/running-out-covid-tests-strategy-flawed,"It has become very clear that there are nowhere near enough lateral flow tests for Covid-19 in England to allow the government’s policy of their indiscriminate use. Even if funding could be found to buy more tests, it is unlikely that the government could source enough tests to meet current and future demand because of the many other countries that are also trying to obtain the tests as they struggle to control the wave of infections from the Omicron variant. The government is in part to blame for the current problems with the increased demand for tests. It has encouraged members of the public to test regularly. For example, before social events such as parties and also before meeting friends and family from outside their immediate household. The very high level of Covid-19 cases in the UK (with around 183,00 cases reported on 29 December) also means that many more people will have been advised to test regularly in line with guidance from Test and Trace. This will include guidance for close contacts of cases who are asked to carry out daily tests for 10 days if they are fully vaccinated and want to avoid isolating. People with a Covid-19 infection can also test themselves on day six and day seven of their illness, and end their period of isolation if they are asymptomatic and the two tests are both negative. What can we do to improve how well lateral flow tests are used? The first step is for the government to publish data on the daily supply of tests. We then need clear guidance from the government on what groups should be prioritised for testing and how frequently they should test. Carrying out several tests in one day is not a good use of these tests. Nor is carrying out daily lateral flow tests after a positive PCR test (other than on day six and seven, as discussed above). Even daily tests are inappropriate in asymptomatic people when there is now such a large gap between the supply and demand for tests. NHS guidance is for staff to test twice a week with a lateral flow test, but many asymptomatic people are testing more frequently than this. NHS trusts and general practices need to review their testing polices and give clear guidance to staff to protect the supply of tests. Once we have information on the daily supply of tests, we can then prioritise who will have access to these tests. This kind of prioritisation is quite normal in healthcare and was done, for example, with Covid-19 vaccination to ensure access was given based on clinical and occupational priority. Groups for priority access to tests should include: NHS staff in patient-facing roles; teachers and other people working in schools; workers in essential parts of the economy such as public transport; and groups such as HGV drivers to ensure that deliveries of essential items continues. It should also include patients who are clinically vulnerable and those following guidance from Test and Trace. We are also facing a shortage of PCR tests and an important question arises for the government: should we use lateral flow tests to give better access to testing for people with symptoms and reduce testing for people who are asymptomatic? If this does happen, we will still need to decide which groups have access to lateral flow tests in place of PCR tests. But successful implementation of this policy could allow many more people to receive a test. Although lateral flow tests are not as sensitive as PCR tests, they will still identify many people with Covid-19. We need to look again at the costs of supplying these tests and to determine what we can afford to spend. Although the tests are supplied at no cost to the public, they are not free and will come at a considerable cost to the taxpayer. Access to diagnostic services and other health services always has to be limited; and based on factors such as clinical need, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. With the country facing record numbers of people with Covid-19, it is important to maximise the benefits of England’s testing capacity. We need the government to act quickly, decisively – and rationally. Azeem Majeed is a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London",2021-12-30 17:45:02+00:00,136640,2
136706,commentisfree/2021/dec/30/christmas-omicron-uk-pandemic-hospitalisations,Opinion,"Now Christmas is over, how bad is the Omicron situation in England? | Paul Hunter",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/30/christmas-omicron-uk-pandemic-hospitalisations,"Public holidays are notoriously difficult for epidemiologists – people may avoid or delay both testing and hospital visits, making for slightly unreliable numbers. But some things are still clear from the latest Covid data released by the government. Omicron is now responsible for more than 90% of all new infections in England (the other three nations haven’t published a full set of data yet), meaning that its particular effects are now driving the pandemic. And its rate of growth versus earlier this month appears to have slowed considerably. It is barely three weeks ago that Omicron infections were more than doubling every two days. If that rate of increase had continued we would be close to 1 million infections per day by now. Even the Christmas holiday cannot explain the difference between that estimate and the most recent reported infection numbers for England of 117,000. On the other hand, hopes from before Christmas that we may have seen the epidemic peak were almost certainly premature. Overall cases are still increasing, and we haven’t seen the worst daily report yet, but the lower rate of increase means a lower eventual peak than previously thought. Drilling down into the data we can see large changes in how the epidemic has moved through different age groups. In mid-December infections increased most rapidly in the 20-to-40 age group, however in the last few days before Christmas there was a dramatic slowing in the rate of increase in that group. By contrast infection rates in the 50+ age group were relatively flat for the first half of December but in the 10 days before Christmas the rate of increase in infection rates in this age group increased substantially. This older age group is far more likely to be admitted to hospital, and so admissions have risen in recent days, as has the number of beds occupied by people with Covid in England: currently 9,546 compared to 6,434 two weeks previously, a 48% rise. But the number of patients with Covid occupying mechanical ventilation beds remains fairly level and is actually below what it was a few weeks ago. The most recent data for England was 758 on 28 December, compared to 795 two weeks previously. Deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test are still falling slightly, but we would not expect to see any impact on the death statistics from the recent rapid rise in Covid for another couple of weeks. How the next few weeks – never mind the next few months – play out in the UK is still far from clear. Even though the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than Delta, and for many the infection is just a mild, cold-like illness, that is clearly not the case for all. Ultimately the amount of pressure on the NHS will depend on how many people become ill enough to be admitted to hospital and that will depend on how high infection rates go, especially in the older age groups. If, as was the case in South Africa, cases increase very rapidly, peak and fall rapidly then the pressure on the NHS may be short-lived and manageable. But the epidemic in the UK may not follow what happened in South Africa. So where does this leave us with knowing how to best manage as we move beyond new year? It all depends on how much pressure Omicron will place on the health service at its peak and how long that period of high demand lasts. We probably won’t know until a week or so after the holiday period what is likely to happen in January and beyond. Interventions and measures that reduce the transmissibility of an infection will reduce the peak but are often associated with a longer-lasting epidemic – people who are susceptible simply become infected later, rather than all at once. In other words, social distancing measures may not prevent but only delay infections. In addition to reducing the height of the peak – and thus the immediate pressure on the health service – there can be other important gains from delaying infections, especially if new treatments or new vaccines are expected that will substantially reduce death or severe disability. This time, though, there is nothing likely to make a big difference expected soon. Another complicating factor is that the effectiveness of the vaccines versus infection declines with time. Recent data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests that the protective effect of the booster shot may be waning after about 10 weeks. Its effectiveness against severe disease is more durable than effectiveness against mild infection, but will still decrease with time. As always, interventions are a matter of fine timing. It is still not clear how this new Omicron-dominant wave will play out. Earlier this week the UK government chose not to introduce new measures before the new year, instead adopting a wait-and-monitor approach as long as hospitalisations remained relatively low. The US CDC recently reduced the recommended isolation period for people with a positive Covid test – but no symptoms – from 10 to five days. This may indicate a new preference for less restrictive policies if soaring infection numbers no longer necessarily mean mass hospitalisation and death.

The case numbers will likely rise when we soon begin to open up. That is inevitable. But our focus needs to be on the rate of people being hospitalised”. Well, he was spot on with respect to case numbers rising. The trouble is, that they have risen much faster than expected.
The University of New South Wales recently reported modelling showing that 25,000 cases a day for NSW were possible by the end of January. With 12,226 cases for the state on Thursday, it not only looks very realistic, but is most likely an underestimate. Even if Omicron is milder than Delta, with thousands of cases a day, hospitalisations and ICU admissions will inevitably rise. We are already seeing this in NSW. And when he wrote about living with Covid, Morrison failed to mention that many infected people end up with long-term health problems, a condition we call long Covid (or post-Covid-19 condition).
Although most people infected with Covid-19 return to normal health after their infection, more than a third may still have health problems three to six months after recovery. Those most at risk of long Covid include people aged over 50, females, and those with chronic health conditions and obesity. Having a psychiatric or an immunosuppressive condition also increases your risk. There is some evidence that the severity of the initial Covid-19 infection doesn’t seem to affect the chance of you getting long Covid, although there are mixed findings on this. If you are unfortunate to end up with long Covid, common symptoms include abnormal breathing, constant fatigue, malaise, sore chest, sore throat, heart abnormalities, headache, muscle pain, abdominal problems, nerve pain, insomnia, dizziness, brain fog, anxiety and depression. In fact, just about any organ in your body can be damaged by the virus. On a more cheerful note, at least one study has found that children are less likely to get long Covid. We are still learning about long Covid and all of the studies referenced above have been on previous variants. Unfortunately, because Omicron has only been around a few weeks, it is too early to know whether the new variant will be just as bad for long Covid. The Australian Medical Research Future Fund is about to fund one or more major studies of long Covid in Australia, so more information will become available in the next two to three years. Like Australia, many European countries have gone through the same route of reopening and trying to live with Covid-19. But Prof Martin McKee, a European public health expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, is critical of the French and UK governments’ responses and disbanding of public health measures. He wants to return the focus to cases, and on bringing cases down to as low a level as possible, rather than simply trying to live with the virus.
This doesn’t necessarily mean lockdowns, although McKee points out that these have been very effective in Austria and the Netherlands, albeit for the Delta variant. He argues that the focus now should be on public health measures like improved air filtration and ventilation. What a sensible idea. Unfortunately, the Australian government rarely learns from other countries. Meanwhile, the elephant in the room called long Covid is still there, but quite invisible to our politicians. • Prof Adrian Esterman is chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia.

137504,commentisfree/2021/dec/24/pandemic-earth-lockdowns-climate-crisis-environment,Opinion,"The pandemic is a warning: we must take care of the earth, our only home | Bruno Latour",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/24/pandemic-earth-lockdowns-climate-crisis-environment,"There is a moment when a never-ending crisis turns into a way of life. This seems to be the case with the pandemic. If so, it’s wise to explore the permanent condition in which it has left us. One obvious lesson is that societies have to learn once again to live with pathogens, just as they learned to when microbes were first made visible by the discoveries of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. These discoveries were concerned with only one aspect of microbial life. When you also consider the various sciences of the earth system, another aspect of viruses and bacteria comes to the fore. During the long geochemical history of the earth, microbes, together with fungi and plants, have been essential, and are still essential, to the very composition of the environment in which we humans live. The pandemic has shown us that we will never escape the invasive presence of these living beings, entangled as we are with them. They react to our actions; if they mutate, we have to mutate as well. This is why the many national lockdowns, imposed on citizens to help them survive the virus, are a powerful analogy for the situation in which humanity finds itself detained for good. Lockdown was painful enough, and yet many ways have been found, thanks in part to vaccination, to allow people to resume a semblance of normal life. But there is no possibility of such a resumption if you consider that all living forms are locked down for good inside the limits of the earth. And by “earth” I don’t mean the planet as it can be seen from space, but its very superficial pellicle, the shallow layer of earth in which we live, and which has been transformed into a habitable milieu by the aeons-long labour of evolution. This thin matrix is what geochemists call the “critical zone”, the only layer of earth where terrestrial life can flourish. It’s in this finite space where everything we care for and everything we have ever encountered exists. There is no way of escaping our earth-bound existence; as young climate activists shout: “There is no planet B.” Here is the connection between the Covid lockdowns we have experienced in the past two years, and the much larger but definitive state of lockdown that we find ourselves in: we are trapped in an environment that we have already altered irreversibly. If we have been made aware of the agency of viruses in shaping our social relations, we must now reckon with the fact that they will also be moulded for ever by the climate crisis and the quick reactions of ecosystems to our actions. The feeling that we live in a new space appears again at the local as well as the global level. Why would all nations convene in Glasgow to keep global temperature rises below some agreed upon limit, if they did not have the sensation that a huge lid had been put over their territory? When you look up at the blue sky, are you not aware that you are now under some sort of dome inside which you are locked? Gone is the infinite space; now you are responsible for the safety of this overbearing dome as much as you are for your own health and wealth. It weighs on you, body and soul. To survive under these new conditions we have to undergo a sort of metamorphosis. This is where politics enters. It is very difficult for most people used to the industrialised way of life, with its dream of infinite space and its insistence on emancipation and relentless growth and development, to suddenly sense that it is instead enveloped, confined, tucked inside a closed space where their concerns have to be shared with new entities: other people of course, but also viruses, soils, coal, oil, water, and, worst of all, this damned, constantly shifting climate. This disorienting shift is unprecedented, even cosmological, and it is already a source of deep political divisions. Although the sentence “you and I don’t live on the same planet” used to be a joking expression of dissent, it has become true of our present reality. We do live on different planets, with rich people employing private fire fighters and scouting for climate bunkers, while their poorer counterparts are forced to migrate, suffer and die amid the worst consequences of the crisis. This is why it is important not to misconstrue the political conundrum of our present age. It is of the same magnitude as when, from the 17th century onward, westerners had to shift from the closed cosmos of the past to the infinite space of the modern period. As the cosmos seemed to open, political institutions had to be invented to work through the new and utopian possibilities offered by the Enlightenment. Now, in reverse, the same task falls to present generations: what new political institutions could they invent to cope with people so divided that they belong to different planets? It would be a mistake to believe that the pandemic is a crisis that will end, instead of the perfect warning for what is coming, what I call the new climatic regime. It appears that all the resources of science, humanities and the arts will have to be mobilised once again to shift attention to our shared terrestrial condition.

Maybe that’s the wrong question | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/23/should-americans-ditch-their-holiday-plans-maybe-thats-the-wrong-question,"When it comes to the surging Omicron variant of Covid, just about all I’m hearing is advice about holiday planning. Should one attend a holiday party? Travel? Meet friends at a restaurant? Much of the answer boils down to how to calculate one’s tolerance for risk when so little is known about Omicron except that it spreads easily. Experts are throwing around a lot of numbers. Columnists are sharing their own personal calculations. I understand. We’re all a bit spooked and don’t know exactly what to do. Calculations offer a degree of reassuring certitude. But why does America need to turn this latest Covid surge — as we do so much else — into a question of individual risk, personal calculation, and self-concerned choice? Personal responsibility is important, of course. But I worry that this hubbub over individual risk assessment is distracting us from what we need to do now as a society to be readier for Omicron than we were for Delta or for the first Covid surge. It also plays directly into the hands of anti-vaxxers who want to believe Covid is only about personal choice. On Friday’s Fox Business, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was asked if he was getting the booster. DeSantis smirked, shook his head no, and then went into a long harangue about why people should make vaccine decisions “for themselves.” This past weekend, at Turning Point USA, the Maga college Republican spin-off (whose founder died from Covid-19 last summer), Sarah Palin said it would be “over my dead body” that she got vaccinated (no pun intended). And Tucker Carlson (perhaps the most harmful person in America these days) railed against those who are urging vaccination, saying they just want to “punish people.” Carlson then praised the “naturally immune” who “earned it.” It’s too easy for the rest of us to respond to this rubbish by telling ourselves that anti-vaxxers will pay the price because they’re putting themselves at much higher risk of being hospitalized and even dying. But this kind of thinking reflects the same dangerous fallacy — that each of us must make such life-or-death decisions solely for themselves. On Friday, Jeff Zients, the White House Covid coordinator, inadvertently promoted this fallacy by telling reporters that while the administration will work to minimize Omicron disruption for the vaccinated, the unvaccinated should expect “a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families....” In reality, all of us are in this together. And so far, all of us together are failing. America’s rate of deaths from Covid is the highest of all advanced nations. Fewer than 62 percent of us are fully vaccinated — the lowest of all advanced nations. Those who continue to refuse to get vaccinated are endangering the rest of us — and not just because they’re increasing the risk of a “breakthrough” infection in those of us who have been fully vaccinated. As Omicron surges, the unvaccinated are likely to overwhelm hospitals throughout the land, making it harder for our entire health system to respond to all health needs and emergencies. The unvaccinated are also incubators for the next variant. Anti-vaxxers aside, the emphasis on individual risk is allowing us to forget the social needs that became exposed when the pandemic first hit in early 2020 — most of which are still unmet. America is still doing almost no contact tracing compared to other advanced nations. Rapid Covid tests are still difficult to find, and too expensive. (The free tests that the Biden administration is touting won’t be available until next month.) N95 masks are still in short supply. There’s still little or no coordination among different levels of government. Biden’s order that large businesses require employees to be vaccinated remains stuck in the federal courts. Hospitals in many places still don’t have enough Intensive Care Units. We could once again face a shortage of ventilators. Too many workplaces are still unsafe. They’re still not required to test employees and report all Covid infections. They still don’t have to provide personal protective equipment. Workers still can’t stay home for fear of getting the Omicron variant at work because we still don’t have a national system of paid leave (thanks to Joe Manchin and senate Republicans). They can’t quit their jobs because extended unemployment insurance has run out. America still isn’t taking the lead in getting vaccines to poor nations around the world, thereby allowing more variants to emerge. I’m unable to advise you about whether you should attend that holiday party or cancel your travel plans. But I can assure you that what we’re facing is not just a matter of personal choice or individual risk tolerance. We’re facing another test of America’s capacity to respond to a public-health crisis. And the safety of every one of us depends on the nation doing better this time than we did before.

137694,commentisfree/2021/dec/23/omicron-covid-19-long-hauler,Opinion,Don’t dismiss Omicron as ‘mild’. Take it from a Covid long-hauler | JD Davids,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/23/omicron-covid-19-long-hauler,"On Wednesday, the New York Times – and others – published what appeared to be good news. “Omicron infections seem to be milder, three research teams report” read the headline. Many readers must have been relieved to see this news, especially with cases sky-rocketing even as the holiday season is in full swing. As someone living with post-viral conditions exacerbated by Long Covid, I read the story carefully. I noted the preliminary nature of the data from South Africa, Scotland and England, and the prediction that the greater infectiousness of Omicron would still likely land many people in hospitals already strained to capacity. But despite these caveats, I felt little relief or reassurance after reading the article. It contained no mention at all of Long Covid. Not one. This is not a benign oversight; it’s a fundamental and dangerous misread of our global predicament and the future that awaits us.
We’ve still got a lot to learn about Covid-19, including this new variant. But one thing we know for certain is that “mild Covid” can be debilitating and lead to long-term or permanent disease and disability. We now know that at least 10-30% of those who survive any Covid infection (from asymptomatic or “mild”to severe) will go on to live with (and sometimes die from) long Covid – a long-term, lifelong, or even life-threatening or fatal, disabling chronic syndrome, the biological pathways of which are still largely unknown. Even before Omicron, the CDC estimates there have been at least 146.6m Covid infections in the United States alone – meaning at least 15 million people are estimated to have long Covid. And now, many formerly healthy people who now have long Covid face the Omicron wave made more vulnerable by conditions known to greatly increase risk of severe or fatal Covid – including long Covid-associated diabetes, strokes and lung disease. As Omicron entered the news in November, early reports from South Africa noted that many cases were mild. In some ways, this was utterly predictable – the nation has a relatively young population, and more severe disease often takes several weeks to develop. But the rapid dissemination of this speculation was not politically neutral. And the potential consequences are not mild at all. The “mild” theme was quickly picked up by leaders who have vowed to never repeat the lockdowns and other restrictions of previous waves. A faster-spreading strain in the lead-up to a holiday travel season in many areas of the world would have drastic economic implications. It also was an opportunity for dog whistles on “herd immunity”, the bot-fueled and misguided notion embraced by some of the same forces promoting climate science denial: that preventing Covid-19 spread would become unnecessary or even harmful by delaying natural immunity or the evolution of a truly globally insignificant dominant strain. But Omicron, more resistant to vaccines and natural immunity, is driving a huge global wave of infection. Thus, even if there’s a higher percentage of mild cases, we expect a terrible toll in mortality and strained health systems. One individual infection can rapidly spiral into a multi-generational tragedy, multiplied on a world scale. Any one young person’s mild infection this Christmas could rapidly become their grandparent’s demise. And few reports on Omicron even mentioned long Covid as a concern. If we were in the early, terrifying days of 2020, perhaps we could forgive the beleaguered general public and frazzled world leaders for not also referencing long Covid as a terrible consequence of a Covid surge. After all, those of us living with post-viral conditions – such as ME/CFS, dysautonomia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (Pots) – are used to being ignored, disbelieved, or misadvised. We were on few radars before Covid; even now, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)‘s Recover Initiative on Long Covid has all but ignored post-viral researchers and sidelined patient advocates. But it’s been abundantly clear for more than a year that even asymptomatic infection brings a significant risk of long Covid – a wide spectrum of more than 200 symptoms and conditions that can appear months after initial infection or apparent recovery, and leave children, adults and elders disabled, chronically ill and desperate for medical care, income, housing or even recognition that their suffering is from real physical conditions.
On 15 December, South Africa’s Dr Salim Abdool Karim, who co-authored Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant: a new chapter in the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lancet, told a global Zoom audience: “I have no idea what’s in store for us as far as long Covid is concerned … It’s a really important question, and it’s particularly so because Omicron is spreading so fast and so widely so quickly – the number of people getting infected is so big that … if it’s a common consequence of even mild infection, you can imagine, even if in 10% of people, there’s going to be a lot of people with long Covid. It’s certainly something we want to keep a beady eye out on.” As comrades in a terrible journey, people with post-viral conditions have shared all we have learned with people with long Covid – like the importance of resting and pacing instead of pushing through ME/CFS fatigue, and the jarring reality that ME/CFS has the lowest amount of NIH research funding relative to the burden of disease in the population. We now shudder to think that more will be joining our ranks. There is nothing mild about the massive wave of loss and suffering washing over our world. As a global community, we parrot phrases such as “the majority of cases are mild” at our peril. We’ve already lost too many lives from the false hope that Covid-19 will become more mild or subside. We’ve gone months without significant investments in indoor ventilation, distribution of effective masks and global vaccine access. We need sustained systems of benefits, housing security and basic income support for avoiding Covid infection or dealing with post-viral illness. It’s time to choose our words, and our policies, much more carefully. Let it begin by including analysis of long Covid and post-viral illness in any reporting, speculation or policies, starting with this Omicron wave.

The national vaccine program – especially boosters – is central to containing Omicron, and will be boosted itself with better funding incentives from the commonwealth to GPs, and pharmacies and the states ramping up hubs once again. But the other two areas of control focus may continue to be inconsistent across jurisdictions – partly due to different infection pressures, but also down to differences in risk tolerance that Omicron has not nudged aside. The package of proven strategies that help contain spread, whether the virus is already circulating in the community or to reduce impact if it is reintroduced, are one and the same; masks, physical distancing, hygiene and managing gatherings safely. These were recognised today as a critical pillar in disease control, but the management of these resides with our states and territories, and there wasn’t agreement on how these should be implemented.
What is critical is how well the advice is adhered to, and whether measures already in place need to be tightened. National consistency would be helpful to convey a clear message on the importance of these measures. If there is high compliance in New South Wales already with reportedly 85% mask wearing in retail settings, then introducing a mask rule is not really an impost. Conversely, if rules in other jurisdictions are not achieving high compliance, then that needs to be looked at too. We are moving to greater consistency in case and contact follow-up, but priorities change as resources are spread more thinly when case infection rates grow, and states with low case numbers want to continue more aggressive case follow-up while they can. QR codes still have a role, whether as an outbreak investigation tool in low infection settings or allowing automatic notification of contact with an exposure site or as a memory prompt of your movements in high transmission areas. Small steps on Wednesday, but at least this may be a platform for greater national consistency as the coronavirus progressively moves through our community and both our goals and our case load become more uniform. • Catherine Bennett is chair in epidemiology at Deakin University ‘Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly’ It seems it is still not a race. There is a clear need to mandate minimally intrusive but highly protective measures such as masks and QR codes anywhere that Omicron is spreading in the community. The lack of action after the national cabinet meeting held on Wednesday is difficult to understand. We need leadership in making mask-wearing indoors mandatory – leaving this to “personal responsibility” is frankly irresponsible. Wearing a mask to prevent Covid is not analogous to putting on sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. No amount of sunscreen I slap on will protect you from skin cancer. In contrast, Covid is an airborne transmissible virus so if you wear a mask it protects me and vice versa. And all of us wearing masks consistently will protect the health system.
We need to ensure high testing and tracing capacity – for the latter, QR codes are the only way to keep up when case numbers are high. We have invested in the infrastructure for digital tracing so it makes no sense to throw it all away. The 3,763 cases in New South Wales on Wednesday will have up to 80,000 contacts, and the contacts are the most likely to become the next cases. If we don’t alert the contacts, the epidemic will explode, health systems will collapse and we may be forced into the lockdown that we never wanted after all. Magical thinking will not stop this – only a smart, layered strategy will do that. For NSW to abandon everything as cases surge during the time of maximal gatherings, will result in avoidable illness and death. But it seems that any national strategy for TTQI can wait another two weeks for the next cabinet meeting. We learned on Wednesday there are 20m doses of mRNA vaccine in Australia. It is fantastic that we have the supply but vaccine in the fridge won’t help manage the Omicron surge. Maintaining the delivery of boosters over the Christmas holidays will save lives but that won’t happen without a plan. Other countries have called in the army. We are giving a $10 a dose incentive. With surging cases, NSW Health is already preparing us to turn our homes into hospitals – they advise if you are under 50, manage your Covid at home, and call your GP if you need help. Most GP practices are operating on skeleton staff over the holidays, so good luck with that. There will be preventable deaths of people at home who were unable to access care. We all need to take responsibility for avoiding the worst-case scenario of the Omicron wave. Our leaders are relying on Australians to act responsibly. Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly as well. • Nancy Baxter is head of the school of population and global health at the University of Melbourne.

137823,commentisfree/2021/dec/22/omicron-covid-restrictions-young-people,Opinion,Public support for lockdown measures is disintegrating - a new approach is needed | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/22/omicron-covid-restrictions-young-people,"Throughout Britain’s Covid emergency, the public have overwhelmingly supported drastic but necessary measures to combat the virus – even at the cost of their personal freedom. As the Alpha variant threatened to cripple the NHS in January, 85% of people supported lockdown – as near universal as you are likely to achieve in a democratic society – with only 11% opposed, and of those just over half opposed strongly. From the beginning, the prevailing criticism among the electorate has been that Boris Johnson’s administration has been too slow and soft in reacting: in the first weeks of the crisis, two-thirds believed it should have acted faster. Yet since Omicron revived the Covid threat, that consensus has collapsed. Last week, just 23% of adults in England supported closing pubs and restaurants, 26% backed not allowing people to meet indoors with people outside their household, and there was an even split on large sporting and entertainment events. Those numbers may shift more in favour of restrictions as cases continue to rise, but the difference from last year is stark. The public’s often militant support for authoritarian measures has disintegrated. This is not to say we should succumb to fatalism and let disillusionment with Covid measures veto any response at all. The core dilemmas of the pandemic remain. How do we keep cases as low as possible, above all else to prevent the NHS from being so overwhelmed by Covid patients that it cannot perform its basic function? There is obviously a point where restrictions would be unavoidable, and the lag between infections and later hospitalisation and death makes determining that point and selling the public on it difficult. But we must acknowledge that the waning support of the wider public cannot simply be dismissed as Covid denialism. Or as conspiratorial delusion and heartless contempt for human life, precisely the sort of perverse crankery epitomised by Piers Corbyn. Indeed, to do so risks abandoning the growing ranks of the disenchanted to conspiracy-mongers who claim drastic measures to preserve public health and human life were always as unnecessary as they were malign in intent. Their exhaustion is understandable. It is no surprise that polling shows young people generally most opposed to new restrictions. They have acted as a cordon sanitaire to protect old and medically vulnerable people. While the threat of long Covid to young people should not be dismissed, the risk to their lives has been very low. Yet the ability to socialise or establish relationships in their best years has been criminalised; their educations have been injured; their mental health more damaged than that of older generations.
On top of more than a decade of austerity policies that disproportionately targeted the young – and a government which believes there is little to be gained electorally from policies that alleviate their distress – they quite rationally believe they have been abandoned. More widely, consider the 8 million people who live alone, condemned to often painful solitude; the low-paid who, unlike middle-class professionals, were compelled to travel to often unsafe workplaces; or the families in overcrowded flats with no gardens where their children can play. The severity of lockdown always depended on your generation and your class. The trouble isn’t that the public no longer want to stop Covid, rather that the social contract underpinning the pandemic has been shredded. Overwhelming support for lockdown persisted for so long because there seemed to be a stable exit route: that mass vaccination of the population would protect the NHS from the menace of Covid-related collapse. Now that certainty has evaporated an endgame no longer seems sure and the prospect of open-ended restrictions looms. That those responsible for designing the rules and demanding public acquiescence did not abide by the rules themselves – while homeless people were being unlawfully prosecuted for breaking lockdown – further damaged the contract. The true threat posed by Omicron isn’t yet understood, and measures to protect the basic functions of the NHS may need to be taken. But whether the public’s overwhelming obedience to restrictions will endure this time round is now an open question, particularly among younger and poorer Britons who have suffered the worst excesses of the pandemic response. That means emphasising approaches to combat Covid that don’t simply rely on universally restricting freedom. Hiking statutory sick pay and other forms of economic support so workers can afford to self-isolate would improve currently dismal compliance rates, for example. There should also be more support for those who want to work from home, and an emergency programme to improve ventilation in schools and workplaces. As well as helping to contain infections, this would send a powerful message that the government isn’t simply waiting for a new crisis point to be reached before once again abruptly curtailing our freedoms in panicked response. More broadly, there needs to be a focus on permanently and dramatically expanding the capacity of the NHS. In “normal” times this would be of great benefit – people could enjoy a much-improved, less-pressured service – but crucially, the NHS would be protected from shocks such as Covid overwhelming it. This isn’t an instant, straightforward solution – training more medical staff takes time – but a public debate on expanding capacity must surely be the focus. One medical consultant suggests that increasing NHS bed capacity by 10% – back to pre-austerity levels – would allow the service to cope with 200,000 Omicron cases a day, noting it would need to be complemented with improved pay and conditions to retain and recruit staff. If yet another dangerous variant emerges, more restrictions might still be needed – but at least the public would be assured that the government has pursued every possible avenue first. Lockdowns were always understood to come with dire social and educational consequences: but they were a lesser evil than allowing a virus to kill hundreds of thousands, and cause the collapse of the NHS. A sizeable minority are content with indefinite suspensions of freedom – a poll earlier this year found nearly a fifth supported a 10pm curfew, and a quarter the closure of all nightclubs and casinos – but most are rightly not. The false dichotomy between harsh authoritarian measures or mass death must be abandoned for good. But that will require the government to fund and support more targeted measures. A new consensus must be built around such an approach because the public are beginning to snap, and nearly two years on from the outbreaks of mysterious pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan, our suffocated reality is no longer sustainable.

137860,commentisfree/2021/dec/22/omicron-scientists-variant-virus-lab-public-health,Opinion,Omicron is exploding – but scientists are better prepared than for any past variant | Manon Ragonnet-Cronin,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/22/omicron-scientists-variant-virus-lab-public-health,"It’s beginning to feel a lot like last Christmas. Case numbers of a new Covid variant are exploding across the UK, and the prime minister is cautioning that restrictions may be called for. But while the threat of Omicron likely surpasses that of previous variants, our tools to track and combat the virus have also advanced since last year. The world was alerted to Omicron by the Botswanan and South African scientists who first sequenced the novel variant on 24 November, and it was designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization two days later. It was immediately obvious to them that they had something alarming on their hands when they saw the large number of mutations in the Omicron genome. More than 20 mutations differentiate Omicron from Delta, the variant that has dominated the pandemic since the summer of 2021. And many of those mutations are in sites that change the way the virus interacts with our immune system or that increase transmissibility. Those scientists realised the mutations meant the new variant would be likely to infect people who had been vaccinated and might even reinfect people who’d already had Covid-19. And Covid-19 cases were rising rapidly in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Because of all these mutations, Omicron sits at the end of a long branch in the Covid-19 family tree – like a rather strange-looking cousin who doesn’t seem to fit in with the rest of the family. There are three possible explanations as to where this variant might have come from and how it has managed to accumulate so many mutations while remaining hidden. It might have evolved in a part of the world that does little virus sequencing – sequencing inequity means that we are missing early opportunities to detect new variants from many places. Or it might have arisen after a human infected an animal population, allowing the virus to mutate in a new environment unmonitored, and then be transmitted back to us. Or, most likely, the variant may have come from a chronically infected Covid-19 patient with a suppressed immune system – a person living with HIV, for example, or a patient undergoing cancer treatment. Such a situation would allow the virus to accumulate mutations without being challenged by a normal immune response. The Alpha variant that ravaged the UK last Christmas is thought to have evolved within a chronically infected patient. The first Omicron infection in the UK was reported on 27 November, just a few days after the variant was first identified in Africa. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Covid-19 Genomics UK (Cog-UK) consortium have been tracking Covid-19 genomes since the beginning of the pandemic. A regular PCR test doesn’t read the entire genetic sequence of the virus, so a proportion of all Covid-19 diagnoses are fully sequenced so as to spot worrying mutations and identify variants of concern, allowing us to track how the virus is spreading and evolving, in order to inform policy. This has served us well throughout the pandemic. As soon as Alpha was identified in December 2020, analyses comparing its spread to previous variants showed it was far more transmissible. It was clear that the restrictions already in place against other variants were insufficient to stall the spread of Alpha, and this finding led to the third national lockdown in January 2021 and a huge drop in daily case numbers. In March 2021, when the Delta variant was detected in the UK, it had mutations in its genome that scientists suspected would make it far more transmissible than Alpha. Analysis coordinated by the UKHSA through its expert modelling group showed that although Delta was even more transmissible than Alpha, the vaccines were also working well against it. Because of this, the UK changed its vaccine policy, speeding up the delivery of second doses. By the end of June, Delta accounted for nearly all Covid-19 cases in the UK, and while the number of cases increased dramatically, deaths didn’t. The discovery of Omicron – and the finding that it is able to evade immunity in people with two vaccine doses – also resulted in a change in policy, this time with the acceleration of the booster programme. The current challenge is trying to determine whether the rapid spread of Omicron is due to the variant being more transmissible in general, or because it is able to infect people who have previously been vaccinated or infected. The balance of these two factors will determine how Omicron will spread in populations that do not have the immunity of South Africa and the UK. Researchers are also trying to gauge how severe Omicron infections are compared to Delta infections, but this will take time as those infected with Omicron this week will not be admitted to hospital for another week or more. These results will enable the UK and other countries to determine the scale and timing of hospital surges, so that we can be better prepared. Even though this pre-Christmas wave may feel similar to last year, we are in a much better position than 12 months ago. Crucially, we have vaccines that significantly reduce the severity of the disease. While case numbers are unprecedented and rising, vaccinated people are so far experiencing symptoms even milder than in previous waves.
And Omicron was detected much faster than previous variants. We were able to quickly assess its risk based on our growing understanding of the virus’ mutations. Finally, we have streamlined processes to aggregate and analyse data, allowing us to make timely and realistic predictions of the impact of policies. Previous epidemics (such as polio, measles or the 1918 influenza) have only been studied retrospectively by epidemiologists. During this pandemic we are in a live arms race against the virus, adapting our tools against it in real time as we decode its genome. Nonetheless, it is a battle that cannot be fought solely by scientists, and it remains essential that we continue to deploy all our defences: by getting vaccinated, avoiding closed and crowded spaces, reducing contacts, testing when recommended, and continuing to wear masks.

138027,commentisfree/2021/dec/21/hospitalisations-rise-circuit-breaker-omicron-nhs,Opinion,We can’t wait for hospitalisations to rise – England needs a circuit breaker now | Christina Pagel,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/21/hospitalisations-rise-circuit-breaker-omicron-nhs,"The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant represents the biggest threat to the NHS since last December’s rise of the Alpha variant. The NHS only managed then by reducing much non-Covid work and by putting a brake on the rise of cases with the second lockdown in January 2021. A year later, the lack of urgency in the government response is a danger to us all. NHS staff are exhausted. They have been working flat out for almost two years. For some of that time they had to struggle with rising numbers of seriously ill patients with Covid-19. When each wave subsided, they turned to the backlog of cases that had built up in the meantime – this enormous backlog started before the pandemic and numbers almost 6 million people. Meanwhile, Covid patients still make up about a quarter of occupied critical care beds. The risks to the NHS come from three sides. First, Omicron has grown faster than any variant seen to date – including the original spread of Covid-19 in March 2020. The UK Health Security Agency reports that cases of Omicron have been doubling every two days in most regions of the UK. A certain percentage of newly infected people will need hospital treatment – even if Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta. Let’s say that the risk of hospitalisation with Omicron is half that of Delta, although the analysis from Imperial College London suggests this may be optimistic. With a variant that is doubling every two days that gives us only a two-day advantage. Whatever the eventual percentage of people with Omicron who will need NHS care, the absolute number seeking care will also double every two days. Because it takes seven to 14 days from infection to needing hospital, this rapid increase in demand for NHS services will not be seen immediately – probably not until after Christmas – but it will happen. Modelling by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group – which reports to the Sage committee – suggests that by the time we see this impact, four doublings may have passed. This means much higher levels of pressure on the NHS which we can’t do anything about if we wait for hospitalisations to rise before we act. Last Thursday, Sage estimated that without reducing transmission further (over and above plan B), there will be at least 3,000 daily admissions to hospital in England (equivalent to the first wave in 2020), and it could be much worse even than last January. So the question is not whether it will be bad for the NHS, but whether it will be just dreadful or catastrophic. The second risk comes from only focusing on the numbers of patients alone and not staff capacity. It is very likely that staff absences due to infection will also have a severe impact. Fortunately, almost all will have had boosters so they are at little risk of serious illness or death, unlike in the early days of the pandemic. But we know that those who have been boosted are being infected and must isolate. And when a neurosurgeon is isolating, their entire team may be unviable. It also exacerbates the strains placed on those who can still work. The NHS in London is already struggling with major staff shortages due to Omicron: Guy’s and St Thomas’ trust has already had to cancel services and the London ambulance service currently has hundreds of staff off sick. The speed with which Omicron is rising makes it inevitable that we will lose many critical staff just as demand surges. The number of NHS hospital beds in England has more than halved over the past 30 years, with the UK being among the countries with the lowest ICU capacity per population across western Europe. And we already have far fewer doctors than other parts of Europe.
The third risk comes from the way we have taken the efforts of NHS staff for granted. Throughout the pandemic, NHS staff have adapted remarkably to unbelievably difficult situations. They have learned new skills. They have created new ways of working, such as remote consultations (with much maligned GPs seeing many more patients than before). They have repurposed facilities, turning conventional wards into intensive care units. They have provided support for one another when things seemed to be getting too much. But at some point they can do no more. Many staff have left and many more are burned out and cannot face the trauma of another winter desperately helping people to breathe. Many have developed long Covid with more than 3% of health and social care staff reporting persistent symptoms from Covid-19 for 28 days or more, the highest across all occupations. After nearly two years of dealing with crisis after crisis, the NHS just does not have the resilience it had at the beginning of the pandemic. This means that pressures are now higher at lower levels of Covid-19 hospitalisations than in previous waves. As a society, we have a duty of care to the NHS, as well as care-home staff, who have looked after us through incredibly difficult circumstances. We are failing them. We need to urgently protect our health and social-care staff with adequate personal protective equipment. We need to provide all staff with high-quality PPE (including FFP2/3 masks), so they can protect themselves and their families, and reduce in-hospital transmission which can cost lives. We need measures that can reverse the rise in cases rapidly. Vaccine boosters are crucial, but they take effect over weeks rather than days. We have lost the opportunity for less severe early action. The only thing that could work in time is a short circuit breaker to limit indoor social interaction (and return the rule of six when outside, while keeping outdoor hospitality, shops and schools open), as proposed by Independent Sage and Sage. New data on severity and spread is arriving by the day and if good news, the circuit breaker can be lifted rapidly. But we need to act now.

So why won’t it be available for all? | Eric Topol,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/21/paxlovid-anti-covid-pill-why-not-available,"What if there was a pill you could take as soon as you test positive for Covid, that stopped the virus in its tracks? A pill that reduced the viral number of copies in your upper airway (known as viral load) by more than tenfold, markedly reducing contagiousness to others? And that reduced the chance of hospitalization by nearly 90%? There is such a pill, called Paxlovid, which was developed specifically for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, derived from a molecule that was effective in the lab against the original SARS virus, and is a potent inhibitor of the main protease of the virus, called Mpro. It’s the chokepoint for preventing the virus from replicating. It has been tested in two randomized clinical trials compared with a placebo, and not only was its potency established, but it proved to be as safe as the placebo. Until now, our main approach to dealing with the virus has relied upon immunity. Vaccines and boosters induce our immune response, and monoclonal antibodies used early inactivate the virus. That along with mitigation measures such as masking and distancing, and the immune protection derived from prior infection, worked reasonably well to contain the virus’s spread in many parts of the world, along with preventing an enormous toll of hospitalizations and deaths. While our hospitals and staffs were overrun at many times and places, that would have been far worse without the more than 8.7bn vaccine doses that have been given throughout the world. But now we are confronting Omicron, which has achieved extensive immune escape from our vaccines, lowering the effectiveness, even with a booster, to 75% instead of 95%, with the Pfizer shot, against symptomatic infection. That will result in five times as many breakthrough infections compared with prior variants, which is the pattern we are now seeing. Further evidence of Omicron’s immune evading feature is that most of the monoclonal antibodies are no longer effective, since the hypermutated variant does not look enough like the earlier versions of the virus to the antibody response that we mount. That also explains the high rate of reinfections among people with prior Covid, ranging three- to eightfold in South Africa and United Kingdom reports. These were unusual before Omicron and tell us that infection-induced immunity alone is not adequately protective. But it’s not just the immune escape property of Omicron that is the problem. It is the profound rapid growth of cases, doubling in two to three days, in many countries throughout Europe, southern Africa, North America and soon enough throughout the world. There is a definite sense that the cases are less severe than prior variants, but the extent of this and a full explanation for it is unknown. It could be the immunity walls that have been built from prior vaccination and infections, and possibly less virulence of the virus per se. No matter, the transmission onslaught will, at the very least, induce tens of millions of new infections around the world. Already the Netherlands and other countries are starting to lock down, universities in the United States have abruptly closed. This is just the beginning of what can happen when there’s much further spread, particularly in countries like the United States where Delta is still on the rise. With more than 130,000 new confirmed infections a day, health systems will get overrun from inadequate staffing of healthcare workers, many of whom are absent with Omicron infections. The good news about Paxlovid is that it is expected to work well against Omicron because it is the first potent treatment that is not dependent on our immune response. There is only one mutation in the variant in its main protease, indicating this is not a region of the virus that has been prone to undergo mutations. Paxlovid has been highly effective against Omicron in lab studies. That gets us to the vital need for the Paxlovid five-day pill pack (two pills a day, and one other pill, a low dose ritonavir to help raise Paxlovid’s blood level) to be available everywhere. But there is a grossly insufficient supply of only 200,000 treatment courses now, and only 80 million expected by the end of next year. If we had an unlimited supply of these pills, it could have an extraordinary impact on preventing illness, preserving our healthcare workforce, staving off spread, eliminating the need for lockdowns and school closings. Paxlovid intervention might also reduce the toll of long Covid, a disabling symptom complex that can occur with even mild cases. In the days ahead, Paxlovid will gain emergency authorization use by the US Food and Drug Administration. That’s good, but it doesn’t get us where we need to be. We must find a way to rapidly scale pill pack production for wide accessibility and use throughout the world, whether that involves enacting the Defense Production Act in the United States or other bold measures. It is not appropriate at this juncture to rely on a single company to mass produce a small molecule which companies throughout the world are fully capable of making with the highest manufacturing standards. This anti-Covid pill has all the features of a breakthrough intervention at the time when we absolutely need it. It’s a sign of light in a very long tunnel. But its extraordinary promise will not get realized unless we pull out all the stops to quickly get it made and distributed at mass scale.

138062,commentisfree/2021/dec/21/omicron-spreading-milder-virus,Opinion,"Omicron is spreading at an alarming rate, and there's no solid evidence it's 'milder' | William Hanage",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/21/omicron-spreading-milder-virus,"Once again we have seen a new variant of the Covid virus emerge, and health officials are warily eyeing the data from around the world. With Omicron, a key question is whether infections are as severe as those caused by previous variants. Many are speculating that it could be inherently milder, especially after several preliminary reports from South Africa seemed to suggest fewer hospitalisations and less severe symptoms. In my opinion this judgment is premature. Especially in such a rapidly changing situation. Accurately estimating the severity of a new infection is a nightmare. Especially at such an early stage. However, there are some things we should keep in mind when evaluating the numbers coming in. Looking at the severity of infections in South Africa, it is important to remember differences in populations. South Africa has a younger population overall, and Covid in younger age groups has been consistently milder than in older ones. There is also the issue of time, and how long it takes for people to fall ill and get sick enough to require care, and for those numbers to be reported. We are still only a few weeks into this newest wave. Similarly, we do expect infections in a highly vaccinated population such as that of the UK to be milder overall, because vaccination is expected to protect against severe illness. However, that is little comfort to those who have been unvaccinated for various reasons, or otherwise unable to mount a robust immune response after vaccination. The surge of Omicron makes it more likely such people will be exposed. Indeed, because Omicron appears to spread even more quickly than previous variants, we need to be cautious even if breakthrough infections are only occasionally severe, because there are going to be so many breakthrough infections. The ultimate number of severe outcomes is determined by the number of opportunities the virus gets to cause them, which is the result of infectiousness. This is one reason why the Alpha variant wreaked such havoc last winter.
You cannot simply compare Omicron with Delta by adding up the numbers of cases and hospitalisations for each over a short timeframe. The numbers of Omicron cases have been growing faster – much faster – than those of Delta, and it takes time for people to become seriously ill. To accurately gauge the severity, we will need to compare the numbers of cases that end up in hospitalisation or death. Mortality is often assessed as death within 28 days of diagnosis, and Omicron was reported to the WHO less than 28 days ago. We cannot afford to wait to find out exactly how dangerous it is. There is a widespread belief that infectious diseases evolve to become less virulent, leaving many hopeful that Omicron will be less severe for everyone, regardless of age or vaccination status. This is false. Viruses do not necessarily get selected to be milder or more severe. If virulence (the severity of the disease) is not connected to transmission (the factor that makes a virus successful or not) there’s no real link between the two in most real situations. The great majority of Covid transmission occurs before people become seriously ill, and so the virus has already moved on. We should remember that Delta was actually more virulent than Alpha, which itself was more virulent than the original virus. Remember the issue with Covid has never been its virulence. It’s the number of people infected. Everyone wants to believe Omicron is milder. I would like it to be milder myself, but I am very careful to not allow what I want to colour the way I interpret the data. The growth rate of Omicron is such that even if it is milder in most cases, cases can still rapidly add up and threaten the NHS. The UK has a healthcare system already struggling with decades of underinvestment and which was teetering on the brink after months of Delta. People seem to forget that nearly 20,000 people have already died from Covid in the UK since “freedom day” in July. The virus has been much more manageable, but that attrition has not been without consequence. The most definitive estimate of severity that we can expect will come in a few weeks when the UK Health Security Agency (which has done a phenomenal job in terms of analysis in a dizzying turnaround time) reports on the comparison of the outcomes of infections with Delta and Omicron over the same time period. Before then, the South African data should start to become informative on longer-term outcomes. Very early data suggest hospitalisations in Guateng have peaked at a lower level than previous waves. But this is the first wave to have taken place in the presence of immunity of previous infection, which makes things more complicated to interpret. Epidemics of rapidly transmitting viruses are not kind to overstretched healthcare systems, especially ones that have been fighting a pandemic bear for nearly two years already. Boosters will help, but Omicron will be infecting a lot of people receiving boosters now before the doses have had time to act to prepare the immune system. This is why Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust was right, even before Omicron, to propose “vaccines plus” rather than relying solely on the jabs to preserve healthcare. Even if, and it is an exceedingly big if, Omicron is milder than Delta, that is no reason to relax. The transmission properties alone make this serious. The difference between a caress and a slap is largely in the pace with which it is given.

Covid-19 should not have been a surprise – and, since viruses always mutate, neither should Omicron have been. Just as Omicron replaced Delta, something else will replace Omicron. It might be a fresh variant of Covid; it might be something completely new.
“[A]nother pandemic is coming,” says Debora MacKenzie in her book Covid-19: The Pandemic That Never Should Have Happened, “and no one can predict which pathogen will cause the next one.” That doesn’t mean we can’t prepare. Even as we deal with Omicron, we need a long-term strategy, so that we’re not caught unawares countering each fresh outbreak. Here are four necessary (though perhaps not sufficient) slogans to arm ourselves with. 1. Make vaccines free, everywhere and for everyone In the 1950s, when a journalist asked virologist Jonas Salk who owned the polio vaccine, he replied, “Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” Humanity eradicated smallpox by treating vaccines as a public good, created (for the most part) by publicly-owned agencies and distributed on the basis of need. But that was before big pharma, in what journalist Alexander Zaitchik calls “a profoundly undemocratic expression of concentrated corporate power”, pushed for the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) of 1994, an agreement that transformed vaccines into private intellectual property. Thanks to Trips, the horror of Covid-19 delivered a massive payday for pharmaceutical corporations like Pfizer and Moderna, even as they declined to license the technology to manufacturers in developing nations, arguing, controversially, that the lack of expertise, resources and manufacturing capacity in those regions makes doing so pointless. To date, the world’s poorest nations have received only a woeful 0.6% of available Covid vaccines, an obscene disparity and one that creates a pool of permanent illness in which the viral mutations can develop. As the People’s Vaccine Alliance (an organisation backed by Amnesty International and a stellar array of former and current world leaders) says, no one’s safe until we’re all safe.
A pandemic in which more than two million people have died should not be a cash grab. Patents must be abolished. If the corporations can’t deliver vaccines to everyone, they should be nationalised and replaced by institutions that will. 2. Rebuild health and science The Covid-19 crisis revealed the international consequences of underfunded and neglected health services. Medical staff have performed heroically during the pandemic but everywhere they are burnt out and exhausted. Governments must invest massively in medical resources, reversing the austerity of the last decades and creating the specialised facilities – from purpose-built quarantine centres to emergency wards to stockpiles of protective equipment – that will be needed. That means more frontline staff in every setting from hospitals to old age homes; it also means more researchers and scientists. In Australia, the university sector continues to collapse, having lost a staggering 20% of its pre-pandemic workforce. Ongoing budget shortfalls threaten both teaching and research. Medical expertise and research capability can’t be created overnight. We must start rebuilding now. 3. Create community-driven, health-focused responses Pandemics disproportionately affect the poor, the marginalised and the oppressed. The people most at risk from viruses tend, in other words, to be those who fear or distrust the authorities. That’s why the response to a medical emergency should not centre on police and soldiers. Many governments reacted to the emergence of Covid-19 with punitive measures such as curfews, military patrols and new criminal laws. But a health crisis is neither a war nor a policing operation. There’s a much better model to follow. The remarkably successful campaign against HIV/Aids was spearheaded by activists from communities directly affected by the pandemic. It was they who disseminated information, offered services and induced behavioural change, even as they fought against prejudice and discrimination. With a frightening disease spreading, agency and outcome can’t be separated. A population that takes charge itself, that translates health messages into its own idiom, that collectively decides on what to do and how, will deliver far better results than the sternest policeman.
Because a pandemic exposes social inequality, the best responses will necessarily entail a fight for social justice – and, as such, they will be led by the oppressed themselves. 4. End the war on nature We can and should plan to mitigate the effects of novel viruses. But we will only reduce their frequency if we curtail the ecological destruction that contributes to pathogens crossing into human populations. As cities expand into previously uninhabited wilderness, habitat loss brings animals and birds into unnatural proximity with people, allowing viruses to find human hosts. The impoverished fringes of sprawling metropolises, and the industrial agriculture associated with them, provide an ideal setting for mutations – and in a globalised world, an infection in one place becomes an infection everywhere. That’s why scientists worry so much. As MacKenzie warns, there are lots more coronaviruses out there – and plenty of fresh horrors we’re yet to encounter. We can’t keep playing whack-a-mole with each new crisis. We know what’s coming. If we don’t plan to counter it, tomorrow will be like today, except much, much worse. Indeed, Covid-19 should be understood not as an additional disaster piled upon a calamitous heap of fires, floods, heatwaves and tornadoes, but as a specific manifestation of a broader environmental emergency.In a way, that might even be good news (or, at least, as close as we get now), since the fight against the pandemic isn’t a distraction from the fight against climate change. Rather, the two represent two facets of the same campaign, an increasingly desperate struggle to salvage the future.",2021-12-21 04:05:46+00:00,138098,2
138151,commentisfree/2021/dec/20/public-questions-about-covid-evidence,Opinion,Pity a public that has so many questions about Covid. Who should be believed? | Simon Jenkins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/20/public-questions-about-covid-evidence,"British politics this week faces an intellectual crisis. It is one of whom to believe. With yet another wave of Covid at full throttle, the cabinet is reportedly split on whether to rely on its one “winner” from the pandemic, vaccination, or whether to return to mass lockdown. There is no disputing that the Omicron variant is highly infectious. There is bitter argument about how to contain it. On one side is a prime minister, Boris Johnson, and much of his party, pleading for no lockdown. Vaccination, they say, is the one sure defence against this disease. What matters is hospitalisations and, at about 1,000 a day, they are far behind the 4,200 of January this year. Deaths are still further behind. Lockdown would savage the economy, even if relieved by state subsidy. It would bring back social and psychological isolation and devastate not just elderly people but often young people, too. The costs would be enormous. These, mostly Tory, politicians, believe the new outbreak should be dealt with via health policy. The NHS coped a year ago, but the service remains desperately inefficient. Only now is it apparently looking at how to expand care of elderly people to relieve hospital beds. Only now is it proposing to treat more patients at home, while making greater use of GPs, pharmacies and private testing clinics. The NHS is there to absorb pressure. That it may need more money cannot justify a return to lockdown. To these politicians, we should bank on vaccination and take a risk. On the other side are the massed ranks of what is called “the science”. While frontline doctors and medical staff face a sudden rise in patient numbers, scientists on the Sage committees face a nightmare. It is that of a relentlessly mutating virus that nobody yet knows whether vaccination can contain, let alone a vaccination that is readily available to all. They are backed by a strident train of statisticians, modellers, researchers and drug corporations. Each of these groups is a lobby with a vested interest in caution. Their motto is protect the NHS; or – by implication – the NHS will fail to protect you. Don’t take the risks, they cry. This year may not be as bad as last, but you don’t know. When you are racing the devil, you do not stop to ask if he is tiring. Lock down now. Both sides in this argument are political because both are playing a political game. They are exploiting fear and toying with risk. The public’s only sensible reply is constantly to demand evidence for what is claimed. Just now we are being told that the Omicron variant may be a weaker and possibly final form of the virus. Some scientists say it is, some say not. Professor of social psychology Stephen Reicher, who sits on a Sage subcommittee, says alarmingly that by 2022 it will be too late for an effective circuit-breaker lockdown, but how and why? What sort of lockdowns are most effective in reducing infection? Why might shops and schools be left open but indoors pubs and restaurants forced to close? Is that a cost-benefit equation? How many more lives are saved by 2-metre distancing compared to 1 metre? What is the real effect of a two-week “circuit breaker”, or is it just a macho gesture? These seem reasonable questions to which the coronavirus bureaucracy must have answers if it is so sure of the solutions. The public should be now be deluged with evidence if it is to trust government with renewed infringements on its liberties. Yet all it gets are bland, unqualified statistics that have lost any shock value. This is now a political battleground, one of lives lost, devastated and diminished, of costs collateral and unseen, and of ever-dwindling faith in authority. The British government is taking the power to apportion those costs across the nation. Its one duty in return is to present evidence. It must give reasons, reasons galore.

With this new plan, we can control Covid | Gordon Brown",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/20/money-medicines-vaccinate-world-rich-countries-gordon-brown,"Time and again throughout history, perpetrators of injustice have absolved themselves and justified miserliness and inaction by blaming the victim. Amid allegations of African culpability for the Omicron outbreak and complaints from the global north about vaccine hesitancy and low take-up in the global south, 2021 has seen this shameful story being told anew. But the new variant is not Africa’s fault. Responsibility starts with the governments of wealthy nations that stockpiled hundreds of millions of vaccine doses and that, even when warned about the failure to vaccinate more vulnerable parts of the world, did too little as the virus mutated. It is not Africa’s wariness about vaccines that is the decisive problem. It is a lack of African access to them. Of course, anti-vaxxers sow havoc everywhere but the more accurate picture I have, from my visits to various places in Africa and Asia, is of the mother and her family who walk miles, queue for hours, even wait for days for vaccines to be delivered, because she knows from her experience of polio, diphtheria and tuberculosis that the best chance of her family surviving is getting the shots into their arms. Her determination – her faith in the power of medicine to save lives – is a moral summons to respond. But the latest outbreak also reminds us of a practical imperative: that if we fail her, so too we fail our own families and communities by allowing the virus free rein to mutate and return to haunt even fully vaccinated people. With the World Health Organization forecasting 200 million more cases by next September – and potentially another 5 million preventable deaths – the grim truth remains that until no one anywhere lives in fear, then everyone everywhere will have to live in fear. Instead of lurching from Covid crisis to Covid crisis, we must resolve that 2022 will be the year when we finally bring the virus fully under control. Ours is not a fraught choice between boosters and vaccinating the world. We are manufacturing enough vaccines – 11.2bn doses already, 19.8bn by June – to immunise the whole world. But it is an inescapable and unacceptable fact that of the billions of doses of vaccine administered, only 0.6% ended up in low-income countries, while over 70% have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Of tests, only 0.4% have been administered in low-income countries, and even basic medical equipment such as oxygen and oral therapeutics remain a luxury, let alone ventilators. An estimated 500 million people who are already poor are being pushed further into extreme poverty because of payments they have to incur for healthcare and the pitifully low 4% full-vaccination rate for low-income countries and 8% rate in Africa are a grim reproach that we appear to value human life in the south far less and far more cheaply than in the north. These inequalities are not just a medical failure but a moral lapse, a stain on our global soul. The great global challenge of 2022 must be to wipe away that stain by finding the money to bridge the yawning divide between the world’s protected rich and unprotected poor – and in so doing end the indefensible but perennial underfunding of global health. I know from my experience of the 2009 financial crisis, when the world economy was underpinned with $1.1tn (£830bn) of support that, in the words of Keynes about a previous emergency, “anything we can actually do, we can afford”. In the first weeks of 2022, we need to achieve for the world what Britain is attempting for our own citizens: to deploy every available nurse, enlist every available community health worker, provide every available test and treatment, commandeer every known distribution agency and summon up the support of the military where necessary. We must show that just as Coca-Cola can get to faraway places not listed on maps and Pfizer can deliver vaccines by drones then so too must we get jabs into arms across communities that have never before known adult vaccinations. So the richest economies should immediately underwrite the urgent request for $23.4bn – which includes $1.5bn to finance the WHO – from ACT-Accelerator, the coordinating agency for vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. It may sound like a huge sum, but is more than 200 times smaller than the $5.3tn the IMF estimates will be the Covid- induced loss of economic output by 2026. The $23.4bn breaks down to just 10p a week to be paid by every citizen of the wealthier countries and would not only save next Christmas but be the best investment the world could ever make. Surely making the difference between life and death is worth more than the price of the cheapest biscuit? There are four potential sources of sustainable long-term funding to cover this $23bn, an additional $25bn to build in-country capacity to administer tests and treatments and the $10bn required annually, as recommended by three independent reviews, to prepare for and prevent future pandemics, all of which could be pledged at the vaccines conference to be recalled by the US president, Joe Biden, at the outset of 2022. First, the international community should agree a formula to share the costs fairly between countries in the same way that we fund UN peacekeeping, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and in the 1960s levied countries to eliminate smallpox. We can no longer rely on the ad hoc, piecemeal lottery of global health funding that is more akin to a whip-round at a charity fundraiser than a serious attempt to move beyond begging-bowl politics. The purest public good of all – control of infectious disease – should be first on the list for a multilateral burden-sharing agreement to finance the WHO and global health, with the US and Europe each offering around 25% of the costs and the rest of the world contributing based on capacity to pay. Second, we must rectify the profound failure of the global system that Covid has exposed. The WHO and those with the global remit to act have the least resources, while the IMF and the multilateral development banks command the most resources, without a specific mandate to act. Another $10bn of World Bank resources, a new IMF vaccine facility and $100bn of the new international money – special drawing rights – should be immediately deployed to build health systems in low-income countries Third, we need to be more innovative by using guarantees from the global north to source the funds we need. Just $2bn of guarantees can be leveraged to create an international financial facility for health that, with $1.5bn of grants, could raise $10bn of additional resources for poorer countries. Finally, we should consider how we can increase the proceeds from Unitaid’s solidarity levy, which since 2006 has raised $1.25bn from hypothecating airline taxes to global health and, with big pharma now admitting it has not done enough, companies that will benefit from the resumption of trade should be asked to join with foundations in our mission to make Covid history. Hope is resilient, but it is also fragile. Hope dies when countries hoard vaccines that others desperately need, when the richest fail to honour solemn promises made to the poor and when we place profit before people. But hope can come alive in 2022 making what once seemed impossible possible. This will begin with first one wealthy country, then two, then half a dozen, then all uniting together, resolving to stop the march of this lethal disease – not only to save lives but to affirm we value all human lives equally. By these acts of solidarity, thousands of mothers, like those I have met across Africa, who are today waiting to see whether a world that fell apart in 2020 and 2021 will come together in 2022, will discover to their relief that we do indeed feel the pain of others and that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.

138248,commentisfree/2021/dec/20/nurse-covid-vaccination-centre-proud-fix-pandemic,Opinion,As a nurse I see people worried about vaccines: that doesn’t mean they’re anti-vaxxers | Heather Randle,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/20/nurse-covid-vaccination-centre-proud-fix-pandemic,"I started working as a nurse in 1987. I’m coming up for my 35th year: I knew it was an anniversary, but I had to count which one. Sometimes I feel I’ve been doing this for too long. But the Covid vaccination programme has been amazing. We have seen how, when we want to do something, we can pull it off. I work as a vaccinator at a centre in Coventry where we get through 440 a people a day, usually between five vaccinators; about 80 people each. The mobilisation of this workforce and the rollout has been outstanding. The camaraderie is the best bit of the job for me – that we’re working together and it’s positive when so much is doom and gloom. We’re doing something to fix the pandemic, and fixing things is what nursing is about. I find myself smiling under my mask; I’ve realised people can see it in my eyes, even if they can’t see my mouth. Our centre is in a clinical setting, but there are many in other places like Sikh temples and mosques, which is great, I think, to get to people more hesitant, to allow people to have their vaccine in a more comfortable, or familiar setting – and to reach all communities. I notice the loud person, the quiet person, the person who may be scared. One went pale when I drew up the vaccine – my colleague was administering – and I thought, “He’s about to faint.” I gave him what we call in nursing “the reassuring arm”. I spoke to him, about nothing in particular; I held his hand. The colour came back to his face. Afterwards, my colleague said I’d acted fast, but that’s what we do. As a nurse, I’m always looking around to see what is going on: who may need more care. I see a lot of fear in people’s faces, people are scared. Some come in who have lost family members. I’ll never forget the young mum with lung disease right at the beginning of the vaccine drive, last winter, who said, “I think I might actually survive this.” I always well up in this job. Nurses in GP surgeries, which is my background, often feel invisible. But we are the first people you talk to when you want to set up a vaccine clinic: we run them all the time in general practice – for flu, HPV, baby vaccines. It’s as much about the logistics of running a service – getting the staffing numbers right, ensuring adequate PPE for the team, the safe disposal of needles and syringes – as it is about delivering vaccines.
Vaccinators work swiftly, but I have seen cases where people do hurry, and we say to them to take their time. I’ve learned to spot the people who might have concerns; I try to build trust with them and ask them to look at the science. It’s hard in a fast-moving environment, I have to build a relationship with someone in three to four minutes. But I think it’s important vaccine-hesitant people are not labelled anti-vaxxers: I would say to anyone who has doubts about having their vaccine, ask questions. People always apologise to me for asking, but they’re the ones I want to spend the time with. Two extra minutes could mean they come back for their second jab or their booster. Occasionally someone will walk out and decide not to get the vaccine, and that’s fine. It’s a personal decision at the end of the day, but it’s important to leave the door open so they know they can come back and get it another time. We vaccinate people in their homes, too. We work with people’s carers. We’ll go to any length to provide people with the support they need. Nurses have helped and responded like this throughout the pandemic, going the extra mile. Colleagues are burning out, of course, but when we’re asked to do more we will. That’s in our nature as nurses. And I want Christmas dinner with my parents, who are in their 70s, as much as the next person, so I know how important it is to deliver vaccinations. It’s a real undertaking, but I’m proud to be involved.

But we must keep going | Nesrine Malik",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/20/tired-of-fighting-covid-pandemic-exhaustion,"During the past two years, each stage of the pandemic has brought with it a new species of tired. The first was a heady sort of tiredness, all jittery over-vigilance when the first lockdown happened. The memory of that time has an almost lunar quality: it felt like being marooned in a pod on a hostile deserted landscape but with your lights and radars still blinking, still whirring, powered by adrenaline and restlessness. It was a short, sharp fear, in anticipation of a crisis that would be intense but soon over. And it was soon over. Sort of. And then it wasn’t. Then it was over again, then around Christmas last year, it wasn’t. And now, after a brief late-summer of almost normal, the emergence of the Omicron variant means that Covid is threatening the holiday season for the second year in a row, as restrictions tighten around Europe and scientists advising the UK government turn up the volume on their demands for more curbs before the new year. The British experience is distinguished from much of the world by the in-plain-sight element of our government’s incompetence and corruption. But the uncertainty, the stop-starts, that marooned feeling of waiting to be rescued, the anticipation of life changing overnight, has been a global experience that is still ongoing. Once again, borders are sealed and airports shut down. Once again, infections are rising and as many start planning to travel home for holidays, a ripple of rumours has started. I have heard them from Nairobi to Norwich, predicting another lockdown, another domestic travel ban, another last-minute intervention by authorities who wait too long and act too late. With the dashing of each raised hope and resurrected plan, a new tiredness sets in: a turbulent kind of tired, hot with anger towards politicians whose reckless behaviour claimed your loved one; a confused, self-berating tired, when you don’t seem to be able to complete the most simple of tasks. It’s a glass-eyed tiredness, endlessly scrolling but not absorbing, trying to become animated by force-feeding yourself the news and images of a world you can’t experience. And now, creeping in, is a sloppy tiredness. If you haven’t felt it you will recognise it in someone who has. The kind of tired where – after months of following every single rule, from the sensible to the unreasonable – you are tempted to skip a test and go about your business if you’re feeling poorly. You might cancel your Christmas party, but still make a couple of what you know are not strictly wise visits to the pub. You might not do other small things that do not seem worth the effort, you might let your mask slip on a journey home, you might, as I have often done on a long commute, take the packed train because you are too tired to wait for the next one an hour later. Multiply that tiredness by a thousand if you live in a country where there are not only no boosters, but barely any vaccines at all; where the only means to combat Covid are cyclical lockdowns and curfews, all of which merely keep calamity at bay rather than eliminate it. I have written over the past year of family and friends across the African continent clubbing together to pool resources in the absence of public health support, but now I can see their resolve weakening with every death, with every economic blow. Their efforts at social distancing and mask-wearing have been effaced by time and the realisation that without vaccines and proper healthcare, their trials will not end. There is now only resignation, both to the virus and the poverty and corrupt governance that have allowed it to spread. We tend to think of our pandemic behaviour in binary terms: compliance with the rules or rebellion. But the reality is that in the middle there is drift: metaphorical knees buckling after two years of carrying the weight of responsibility for your safety but also your family’s – and, in fact, every single stranger with whom you share airspace. And this is where the jeopardy comes in. Despite the cartoonish antics of a government branding lockdown easing as “freedom day”, the big victories don’t come in one heave, one big push in the right direction that will deliver normal life. They come in the small moments of perseverance and resolution. And those are harder to muster because they are solitary and unrewarded.
Whether you are in Africa or Europe, whether you are well-off or struggling, your efforts to maintain good pandemic manners and protocols will appear trivial, dwarfed by epic systemic failings of governance and mocked by the hypocrisies of those who make the rules but do not follow them. Whenever I reach what I am sure is rock-bottom, I try to purge this jeopardy of defeatism by reading the words Seamus Heaney gave to a graduating class in 1966. “Getting started, keeping going, getting started again – in art and in life, it seems to me this is the essential rhythm not only of achievement but of survival, the ground of convinced action, the basis of self-esteem and the guarantee of credibility in your lives, credibility to yourself as well as others.” The key, I think, is to acknowledge the fatigue and make allowances for it – to view it not as a catalyst or a moral failure, but as a place from which to make a recovery. The end of a year offers the temptation of neat resolutions and trite pledges for the future. But as we find ourselves grappling with a new variant and a new wave – once again making grim calculations and weighing up risks to elderly people, steeling ourselves for the prospect of new restrictions and searching for the willpower to follow them – I am just shooting for survival. My only hope and ambition is to make peace with the fact that being tired and being tempted to give up is part of the essential rhythm of life. My hope for you is the same, that your year-end is one of respite and replenishment. If it isn’t, keep going. Get started again.

Like a novice outplayed by a grand master, policymakers have conceded to the forever virus. But on economic matters, platitudes about “building back better” notwithstanding, the fault lines exposed by Covid-19 do not seem to have registered. First is the abject lack of preparedness. The pandemic was predictable. Recent outbreaks (Sars, Mers and bird flu) were ignored. Governments failed to take the threat seriously. The focus on immediate savings ignoring later costs has meant chronic underinvestment in public health, preventive healthcare and related services, all central to the problems of managing Covid-19.
Strategies, including the current “learning to live with the virus” formula, have been haphazard, rarely surviving the briefest contact with reality. While a vaccine was developed quickly, vaccination programs, testing and supplies, such as PPE, doses or rapid antigen tests, have been blighted by repeated failures. It is not a shortage of funds but the lack of competence in building capacity, acquiring and training staff and procuring essentials. Second, Australia’s dependence on personal mobility is evident. Travel restrictions exposed reliance on immigration, foreign workers, educational services and tourism. In recent years, growth has been driven by immigration (at around 1.5% annually among the highest in developed countries). Net arrivals have predictably fallen sharply. Loss of international students and inbound tourists has reduced demand and export revenues, especially affecting some regional economies. Loss of skilled foreign workers and low cost itinerant labour have impacted many sectors, including hospitality and agriculture. A rapid reversion to the pre-Covid status quo remains unlikely. Third, Australia’s service-based economy, focused around health, wellbeing, hospitality, entertainment and leisure, is problematic. This sector, which provides over 80% of all jobs, is vulnerable to social distancing and limits on movement. Even without formal prohibitions, uncertainty, caution and isolation requirements can cripple demand and workforce availability. Few personal services can be delivered virtually. They are also non-storable, perishable products. A hairdresser who has to close for a month may find it difficult to make up the entire lost revenue. In contrast, a manufacturer can meet demand for physical goods where the buyers are willing to wait. This permanent reduction of income makes services more exposed to disruptions of operations. Fourth, the pandemic re-emphasised Australia’s dependence on global supply chains. Decades of outsourcing and offshoring have lowered costs of products, but even essential supplies (food and medical) and strategic products (defence equipment and refined fuel products) must now be imported. As empty shelves and the scramble to secure anything and everything during the pandemic showed, limited onshore manufacturing diminishes policy choices and sovereignty. Fifth, there is little acknowledgment of the accelerant role of inequality in the pandemic. Today, over 40% of the “uber-ised” Australian workforce are casuals or contractors, effectively piece workers. Most small businesses are sole proprietorships or familial concerns, effectively a form of self-employment. Lacking paid leave, continuity of income and adequate financial resources to weather a downturn, they are unable to stop working and act as vectors for transmissible diseases. Health, aged care, food production and many essential services rely on marginalised workers. Low incomes condemn them to sub-standard, often crowded accommodation and long commutes on public or shared transport making infection control and avoiding economic interruptions difficult.
Reduction of financial support measures increases vulnerability. Sixth, the pandemic showed that Australia is actually eight municipalities – the states and territories . Differences in economic structure and cultures led to inconsistent health responses and border rules. The constitution and division of powers is not fit for purpose and a barrier to dealing with national issues in a coordinated manner. Finally, the pandemic highlighted the deficit in international cooperation. As of late 2021, around 54% of the global population had received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose. The rate for low-income countries was around 6% due to developed country vaccine nationalism and hoarding. Compounding the problems, Australia is now seeking to poach medical professionals from developing countries denuding them of vital trained resources. Australia, alongside high-income nations, faces human and economic backdrafts from their choices. The continued circulation of Covid-19 increases the risk of further mutations, new waves and disruptions. Poor countries may incubate future public health crises, like new viruses or antibiotic resistant infections. All sides of politics, wary of becoming wedged into electorally damaging positions, avoid confronting these challenges. Emollient slogans – ‘we are in good place’ or ‘push through’ – cannot address these problems. These issues vital to Australia’s future may not even make it onto the election policy agenda. • Satyajit Das is a financier and author of A Banquet of Consequences – Reloaded (March 2021) and Fortune’s Fool: Australia’s Choices (forthcoming March 2022)",2022-01-29 19:00:07+00:00,138785,2
139472,commentisfree/2022/jan/26/mathematicians-covid-projections-modelling,Opinion,Why mathematicians sometimes get Covid projections wrong | Kit Yates,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/26/mathematicians-covid-projections-modelling,"Official modelling efforts have been subjected to barrages of criticism throughout the pandemic, from across the political spectrum. No doubt some of that criticism has appeared justified – the result of highly publicised projections that never came to pass. In July 2021, for instance, the newly installed health secretary, Sajid Javid, warned that cases could soon rise above 100,000 a day. His figure was based on modelling from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, known as SPI-M. One influential SPI-M member, Prof Neil Ferguson, went further and suggested that, following the “freedom day” relaxation of restrictions on 19 July, the 100,000 figure was “almost inevitable” and that 200,000 cases a day was possible. Cases topped out at an average of about 50,000 a day just before “freedom day”, before falling and plateauing between 25,000 and 45,000 for the next four months. It is incredibly easy to criticise a projection that didn’t come true. It’s harder, however, to find out which were the assumptions that made the projection wrong. And, of course, it’s harder still to do that before the projection has been shown to be incorrect. But that is what we ask our modellers to do, and we are quick to complain when their projections do not match reality. Much of the criticism they have received, however, has been misplaced, born out of fundamental misunderstandings of the purpose of mathematical modelling, what it is capable of – and how its results should be interpreted. Mathematical models are predicated on assumptions – how effective the vaccine is, how severe a variant is, what the impact of imposing or lifting whole rafts of mitigations will be. In trying to put a number on even these few unknowns, let alone the tens or even hundreds of others needed to represent reality, modellers are often searching in the dark with weak torches. That is why broad ranges of scenarios are modelled, and why strict caveats about the uncertainty in the potential outcomes typically accompany modelling reports. Mathematicians will be the first to tell you that the output of their models are “projections” predicated on their assumptions, not “predictions” to be viewed with certainty. To be fair to him, when Ferguson suggested the figure of 200,000 cases a day, he placed it in the context of the substantial uncertainty surrounding the projection. “And that’s where the crystal ball starts to fail,” he said, “… it’s much less certain.” Unfortunately, such caveats often get lost when modelling is simplified and turned into attention-grabbing headlines. One accusation levelled at UK modelling is that projections are often presented in the media with insufficient accompanying context. While it isn’t always possible to expect modellers who are working flat-out to find time to do media rounds, the resulting communication vacuum can leave results open to misinterpretation or exploitation by bad-faith actors. Critics of modelling also fail to acknowledge that highly publicised projections can become self-defeating prophecies. Top of the list of the Spectator’s “The ten worst Covid data failures” in the autumn of 2020 was “Overstating of the number of people who are going to die”. The article referred to the fact that Imperial College modellers’ infamous projection – that the UK would see 250,000 deaths in the absence of tighter measures – never came to pass. The Imperial model is widely credited with causing people to change their behaviour and with eventually ushering in the first UK lockdown a week later, thus averting its own alarming projections. Given that the UK has already passed 175,000 Covid deaths, it isn’t hard to imagine that upwards of 250,000 could have died as the result of an unmitigated epidemic wave. There have been scenarios in which modellers have taken missteps. Modellers often attempt to answer questions about subjects on which they are not experts. They need to collaborate closely with individuals and organisations who have relevant expertise. When considering care homes in the first wave of the pandemic, for instance, a number of salient risk factors – including the role of agency staff covering multiple care homes – were known to industry practitioners but were not anticipated by the mathematicians. These considerations meant that recommendations based on the modelling may have been unsound. There were more than 27,000 excess deaths in care homes during the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales. Data sharing between modelling groups has also been identified as an area that needs improvement. Early on in the pandemic, unequal access to data and poor communication were implicated in modelling results that suggested the UK’s epidemic trajectory was further behind Italy than it was, possibly contributing to a delay in our first lockdown. In these respects the pandemic has been a very public learning process for mathematicians. Every time someone interprets data – from professional mathematicians and politicians to the general public – they are using a model, whether they acknowledge it or not. The difference is that good modellers are upfront about the assumptions that influence their outcomes. If you don’t agree with the underlying assumptions then you should feel free to take issue with the projections – but dismissing conclusions because they don’t fit a worldview is naive, at best. Despite these reservations, modelling remains the best tool we have to predict the future. It provides a framework to formalise our assumptions about the scenarios we are trying to represent and to suggest what might happen under different policy options. It is always a better option than relying on the gut feelings, “common sense” or plain old wishful thinking that would replace it.

139982,commentisfree/2022/jan/24/britain-covid-how-pandemics-end,Opinion,Reaching for military metaphors won’t help Britain learn to live with Covid | Philip Ball,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/britain-covid-how-pandemics-end,"The Covid pandemic has entered a perplexing phase, challenging our beliefs about what the best responses are and how we should behave. Is Omicron now “just like the flu”, meaning we can relax – or does that overlook the continuing crisis in hospitals, the record hospitalisation rates for children, the continuing deadly danger for elderly and clinically vulnerable people, and the lengthening shadow of long Covid? Is it time, as the government has decided in England, to throw away our masks and perhaps to abandon self-isolation rules, or is that recklessly optimistic (if not just politically expedient for the prime minister)? Our pandemic narratives are splintering. Once, aside from a handful of noisy libertarians who insisted that lockdowns and mask mandates were violations of civil liberty, most people accepted that restrictions were necessary to prevent the health system from imploding and to reduce the risks for vulnerable people. Now, even some experts who previously advised caution and criticised lax and tardy government strategy, such as the public health expert Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University, have suggested that the virus has been largely “defanged” and that it’s time to “move forward” with our lives. Others react to such suggestions with horror, pointing out that this isn’t an option open to all. There’s much talk of the virus having become “endemic” – but that notion of a “persistent, low or moderate level of disease”, generally in a specific geographical region, is a long way from the exponential rise, and now fall, that we have just seen nationwide. It’s likely that it’s where we’ll end up eventually. But the eagerness to reach for the term now reflects an increasing sense that, one way or another, we will have to learn to live with the virus, as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said last week. All of this shows how unwise it is to try to tell a simple story about where we are. As Mark Honigsbaum concluded from his magisterial historical survey The Pandemic Century, the way pandemics end is “never quick and never neat”. Yet, he argued, we yearn for “narrative closure”: hence the allure of “herd immunity”, floated even by the government’s chief scientific advisers as the promised land in the early days of the pandemic and subsequently advocated with misplaced confidence by the Great Barrington declaration. The fantastical nature of such narratives is now coming home to roost. That deluded dream of closure is encouraged, too, by the military narrative the government has adopted. From the outset, as the sociologist Franziska Kohlt of the University of York has written, “government and its representatives ‘declared war on coronavirus’, framed themselves as a ‘wartime government’, and described their response as a ‘battle plan’”. Boris Johnson evidently fancied himself as the pandemic’s Churchill, although his promise in July 2020 that it would all be over by Christmas recalled instead the misguided belief voiced in 1914 about the first world war. Blind to warnings of the harm that warfare metaphors can wreak in medicine – “war on Aids”, “battle against cancer” – politicians have clung to them; even last week Javid insisted that the Omicron variant is “in retreat”. All this jingoistic battlespeak, Kohlt says, is not only distinctively British – the pandemic narrative in Germany was framed more in terms of building dams, for instance – but dovetails perfectly with the exceptionalist ideology of Brexit. Among other things, it enabled the deaths of health workers on the “frontline” to be framed as a noble sacrifice by “heroes” in the line of duty, rather than the avoidable cost of negligence and neglect. As NHS doctor Roopa Farooki has said: “We’re not soldiers. We signed up to care for people.” The wartime rhetoric reached surreal proportions with the government advice to “stay alert”, as though we should be on the lookout for sneaky viruses lurking in the shadows. This war narrative also encouraged the idea that there would eventually be a victory: an armistice day when the foe was vanquished. Hence the full relaxation of restrictions on 19 July last year being dubbed Freedom Day (and how did that turn out?). Now that we are forced to accept that – as experts always knew – there will never be a triumphant declaration of “herd immunity”, much less of “surrender” from a virus perfectly capable, as far as we know, of still generating variants worse than Omicron, we are left casting around for new ways to tell the story. The favourite candidate seems to be “living with the virus”. It’s equally flawed. For Javid and others who believe “personal choice” should be society’s guiding principle, the phrase carries an implication that it’s time to get real, man up and stop hiding behind masks. “Sadly people die of flu as well,” Javid said. “In a bad flu year you can sadly lose about 20,000 lives, but we don’t shut down our entire country.” Indeed not, but this doesn’t mean we eschew other preventive measures and simply take it on the chin. Perhaps instead we might accept that routine mask-wearing to reduce any airborne infection is not just a weird thing people do in Asian countries, and that maybe mild, minimally inconveniencing measures like better ventilation and some degree of social distancing at the height of the flu season might reduce that death toll too.
The idea we should just be getting on with our lives plays along with the narrative that, if victory isn’t an option, we need to be more stoical. That’s all very well if you’re not on chemotherapy, or compelled to cram on to trains every morning, and won’t lose income when you’re off work with the virus. Yet by the same token, lockdowns and other restrictions also hit disadvantaged people hardest. In short, there are no perfect solutions or tidy endings while inequality persists; pandemics are political, and we’re evidently not all in this one together. We need to reject simplistic stories about where we are with Covid. None can be universal and none capture the whole picture: they may conceal and mislead more than they illuminate. We’ve been living with the virus for two years, and we’ll keep doing so as best we can. But spare us the slogans. Philip Ball is a science writer.

In the UK, and many other parts of the world, getting back to work as quickly as possible after sickness is what the neoliberal culture tells everyone to do (and workers indeed may have little choice in the matter in the world of the gig economy and zero-hours contracts). There is little societal value placed on convalescence – itself a tellingly old-fashioned word. Despite the efforts of the medical profession, there are occasions when patients, once their immediate problems have been patched up, feel themselves set loose to recover as best they can on their own. Most of us know how difficult this process can be – even the recovery from trivial complaints can be a trial, let alone that from serious disorders. Sometimes, indeed, a full recovery may not be possible, and the goal may be to regain a measure of dignity and autonomy while living with pain or disease. The large number of people suffering from long Covid is now forcing societies to try to understand, and have compassion for, recoveries that are especially long and fraught, with no clear outcomes. Recovery is not only a physiological matter but, like disease and illness, is shaped by culture and ideas and expectations of the body, as Gavin Francis points out in his new book, Recovery: The Lost Art of Convalescence. It is also a matter for the mind. “We fall ill in ways that are profoundly influenced by our past experiences and expectations, and the same can be said of our paths to recovery,” adds Dr Francis, who works as a GP in Edinburgh. As a society, we are not, he argues, giving recuperation proper consideration: it is something that requires space and active attention to be fully effective. “I often remind patients that it’s worth giving adequate time, energy and respect to the process of healing,” he writes. As for individuals, so with the nation. England’s Covid-19 restrictions will be over at the end of March, and there is a faint glimmer of hope that the end of the acute phase of the pandemic could be in sight. But the UK’s recovery will take much, much longer. Even as the dangers of the Omicron variant are on the wane, the country is teetering on the brink of a cost-of-living crisis and is in the midst of others. And that is just the start. There can be no notion of the country simply snapping back to full health. There are psychological wounds – borne heavily by the very young and the very old – that run deep and will take time to heal, and indeed, may have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. There will be economic, cultural – and, yes, political – recoveries to attend to. The nation may one day be nursed back to health. This sort of long-term recovery will require not just hope and a prayer, but care and a communitarian spirit. “Give time, space and respect to convalescence if you can,” writes Dr Francis. “It’s an act that we need to engage in, giving of ourselves; a work of effort and endurance, and to a certain extent, of grace.”",2022-01-23 17:23:12+00:00,140104,107
140712,commentisfree/2022/feb/27/im-learning-to-live-with-the-guilt-of-my-organ-donors-death,Opinion,I’m learning to live with the guilt of my organ donor’s death | Carly-Jay Metcalfe,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/im-learning-to-live-with-the-guilt-of-my-organ-donors-death,"On New Year’s Day 1998 – the day after my 21st birthday – when I go on the list for a double lung transplant, I’m conscious of three certainties. The first is that without a transplant, I will die, and I will die soon. More than once, I’d felt the breath of my friends’ departures, the timbre of their spirit winding down and the sad predictability of history repeating. Ever since I can remember, I’ve known that this is how my life would be – sitting with the dying, seeing out the living, watching over the dead. The second certainty is that organ donation is the ultimate act of love. It’s peak altruism, kindness on the grandest scale; it’s all that is good about humanity. The third thing I know is that I will be atoning for the rest of my life. This uncomfortable truth might not be what people want to hear.
People often think that once you’ve had a transplant, you’re cured: this is not the case for people like me who have cystic fibrosis. For me, transplant is an ever-changing landscape: the threat of infection, rejection and cancer simmers in the background – a less-than-holy trinity I’ve experienced and might experience again. It’s also often assumed that life after transplant goes on “as normal”, but despite it making no logical sense, at some cellular level, I’ll always feel a disproportionate degree of culpability for my donor’s death; a crushing sense of guilt for simply being alive. I even repent as I commit these words to the page, and nothing will ever assuage what I can only describe as my “dark passenger”. With days to live, I get the call, and for reasons I can’t divulge, following my transplant, some rudimentary details are shared with me about my donor. This is rare in Australia, where it’s nationally mandated that the process of donation remain anonymous. But recipients are encouraged to write letters of thanks, and while I know my letter will be censored of all identifying information, one does hear stories of donor families and recipients writing in code so that they can unravel each other’s identities. Some even meet, become close friends, have barbecues and go to the beach together.
In my first letter, I thank my donor family and acknowledge that thanking them will never be enough. I tell them a little about how I couldn’t walk or shower myself before my transplant, and of my plans for the future; that they have given my family and me a reason to hope. But committing this to paper seems at odds with the sorrow I feel at the loss of their daughter, which I know was sudden and brutal. It almost seems like an exercise in cruelty. Here I am. I am alive – your daughter is not. A few years after my transplant, I’m told that my donor family has moved, with no forwarding address. Someone says it’s their way of moving on, but I disagree. One does not move on from loss. You learn to live as best you can around the shapelessness of your grief, but you don’t move on. I didn’t. I’m certain they would not have. There is a well-worn quote about organ donation: “Without the organ donor, there is no story, no hope, no transplant. But when there is ... life springs from death, sorrow turns to hope, and a terrible loss becomes a gift.” Novelist Kate Kruimink learned this first-hand after her family chose to donate her mother’s organs. That her mother had made her wishes so explicitly clear meant the decision was a simple one.
“Aside from the obvious life-saving act of donation itself, I see talking about your wishes as a service to your loved ones,” Kruimink says. “It gives them that certainty and that hope and meaning. I feel real love when I think of the recipients of her donations out there, still with us, and that’s enough. I love to hear from them if they’re able, but they don’t have to be grateful, other than just getting on with their lives.” As a recipient, knowing my donor wanted to donate her organs might have helped me to accept such a profound gift with less guilt. But regardless, because of selfless decisions made in their most wretched moments, donors and their families give perfect strangers – who they will most probably never meet – the gift of life. Through me, my donor lives on. Through the people she loved and the people who still love her, she lives on. I can only hope that I have made her proud. After nearly 24 years, through a practice of radical self-acceptance, I have finally come to realise that by living – and striving to live well – I too am participating in the ultimate act of love. • Carly-Jay Metcalfe is a Queensland-based writer.

140990,commentisfree/2022/feb/25/covid-changed-britain-uk-pandemic,Opinion,Time to look at ourselves as a nation and take stock: Covid has changed Britain | Gaby Hinsliff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/covid-changed-britain-uk-pandemic,"When the pandemic started, most of us naively assumed it would have an end: if not a formal declaration of victory over Covid-19, with pubs running dry and strangers kissing in the street, then at the very least surely a sense of relief. We would know it was over, and could then make sense of how this collective near-death experience had changed us as a country. Unfortunately, life is never quite that neat. This week’s scrapping of England’s last remaining Covid restrictions is a choice that vaccines, antivirals and a milder Omicron variant have, arguably, allowed us to make, although it’s by no means clear that future variants will be so obliging. But the virus isn’t over, and we’re some way from making sense of anything. A much-loved face missing at dinner; an emptiness that cannot be filled. The changes wreaked by these extraordinary past two years are painfully obvious to the bereaved, those who lost livelihoods in lockdown and medical staff who saw things they won’t forget. Many parents also sense something different in their children, from the shyness of toddlers reared in lockdown to the social awkwardness of teens who spent too long interacting mainly through their phones. And too many formerly active older people are now visibly scared to go out, or hobbled by chronic illness that worsened during lockdown. But when the Pew Research thinktank asked ordinary Americans to explain in their own words how Covid had changed them last spring, what came back was a confusing mishmash. Some had positively enjoyed hunkering down at home, while others felt frustrated and lonely. Some had saved money but others piled up debt. Some loved home working and were gleefully never returning to the office, while others never left. Almost nine in 10 people described at least one change for the worse in their lives and three-quarters an unexpected upside, but most experienced both at once. The overall pattern was that there wasn’t really a pattern; the pandemic, researchers concluded, had “affected Americans’ lives in a variety of ways, of which there is no ‘typical’ experience”. But the one thing almost everyone felt was that society had gone downhill, with responses describing how Covid brought the best out in people so rare they couldn’t be reliably measured. While it’s natural to imagine that seismic social change must follow epoch-defining events, all the most dramatic predictions have so far been wrong. Employment did not collapse, triggering another Great Depression. People didn’t riot in the streets over being told to stay home. But nor did we “build back better”, constructing a greener and fairer future from the ashes. An analysis of the post-lockdown mood in Britain published this week by the authoritative social research body NatCen concludes bluntly that it “cannot be said that the pandemic has left a legacy of a public that is looking more intently to government to create a more equal society”. Support for raising taxes to spend more on health or education has fallen slightly, with no surge of enthusiasm for redistribution from rich to poor. In times of threat and hardship, people typically feel more inclined to hang on to every penny they’ve got. But if there has been no “great reset” moment, NatCen did identify a gentle acceleration of shifts that have quietly been under way for years.
Back in 2010, the year they voted in the austerity government of David Cameron, 56% of Britons agreed that “if welfare benefits weren’t so generous, people would learn to stand on their own two feet”. By last summer, that was 36%. People aren’t blind to their neighbours’ struggles. Hostility to immigration has faded too, with 53% now agreeing it’s good for the economy and 49% that it’s enriched Britain culturally – up from a miserly 21% and 26% respectively a decade ago. Focus groups run by More in Common (which campaigns for social cohesion) found an enduring warmth towards NHS staff, supermarket workers, delivery drivers and people who got vaccinated to protect others. There is a better country in here somewhere trying to get out, but it needed moral leadership from a government that has repeatedly provided the reverse. (A separate study from King’s College London this week finds public trust collapsing over the past year; by the beginning of December, 62% weren’t sure they could believe what their government said.) And the angels of our better natures are struggling against the only other defining post-pandemic trend: a widespread sense of cynicism, even gloom. Even before police began investigating lockdown-busting parties at No 10, NatCen found two-thirds of Britons thought there was “one law for the rich and another for the poor”. More in Common found only 26% of Britons agreeing last November that “in this country we look after each other”, down from 46% in the summer of 2020; most now think the national mood is “everyone for themselves”. More Britons also now believe society is rigged in favour of the rich and powerful, the kind of pervasive hopelessness that fuels populism. If the past two years were sometimes frightening, it’s the next five that scare me. The lesson of the banking crash – when dramatic predictions of cashpoints running dry and society descending into anarchy also proved thankfully unfounded – is to beware the aftermath, not just the immediate crisis. It was the ensuing decade of spending cuts, stagnating wages and soaring assets that really hurt, breeding resentment, division and a politics of extremes. The looming post-pandemic cost of living crisis, which is only likely to be deepened by the fallout from Russian aggression in Europe, looks like following a worryingly familiar path. Britain is still a calmer and more pragmatic country than it sometimes looks. But while the rabble of anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists and far-right agitators brought on to the streets by Covid remains a tiny minority, it’s a warning sign of something bubbling under the surface, which will find new grievances to latch on to now that restrictions have been lifted. The earthquake may be over; the aftershock, unfortunately, has still to begin. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",2022-02-25 11:00:14+00:00,140991,2
141524,commentisfree/2022/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-covid-plan-political-survival-is-its-point,Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s Covid plan: political survival is its point | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-covid-plan-political-survival-is-its-point,"There can be few people who don’t want to return to the happy-go-lucky days before Covid-19. It’s only human to hanker for a time when one could hug a friend or sit next to a stranger without fear of spreading a deadly disease. But the measured judgments of the government’s top scientists on Monday evening confirmed that going back to the norms of the pre-pandemic world remains some way off. Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance warned that infection rates remain high; that there are still significant numbers of people in hospital with Covid; and that a viral resurgence could “lead to [more] hospitalisations than Omicron”. This makes Boris Johnson’s decision to end all remaining Covid restrictions in England, including the legal requirement to self-isolate, baffling. Also gone by Thursday will be the self-isolation support payments of £500 for those on low incomes, and routine contact tracing. Next week Covid tests will no longer be free for most people including, bizarrely, NHS staff – which will inevitably leave vulnerable patients worried about a risk to their health. While restrictions are being relaxed in other parts of Britain, they have not been as dramatically swept away as in England. Mr Johnson’s decision is reckless. Ending self-isolation and testing will increase infections. Perhaps his gamble is that the effect will be so small that no one will notice. The government is not following the science, but its political instincts. Mr Johnson wants the support of a handful of Tory MPs amid the ongoing partygate scandal. In return for their votes, he is prepared to throw caution – and reason – to the wind. The moves are at odds with the public mood. For all the talk of restoring “freedoms”, polls indicate only 17% think people shouldn’t legally have to isolate. Mr Johnson’s claim that he is letting people exercise “personal responsibility” hides a policy where options are limited to those who have the means. Without proper support for isolation, many will go to work ill and spread Covid. The prime minister’s exhortation that British workers should imitate their German counterparts by staying at home when feeling unwell is undermined by the fact the UK has far lower levels of statutory sick pay. His claim that “anyone who wants to can buy a test” exposes an indifference towards people who cannot afford them. Mr Johnson’s message is that the pandemic is over and life can get back to normal. This is dangerous as it undercuts a public health message, when nearly a third of adults are unvaccinated. Covid is being checked but not eliminated. To help to keep the virus under control, it would be better to ease self-isolation at a slower pace and retain free tests. Mr Johnson frames this as being too expensive, a thinly veiled attempt to panic voters about the state of the public finances. For all the suffering, Covid also revealed new possibilities. The ability of the government to spend vast sums of money demonstrated the economic power it has to address a threat deemed serious enough. The pandemic functioned as an object lesson in what is possible. Maybe it was that hope Mr Johnson feared spreading – even more than the virus.",2022-02-22 19:06:32+00:00,141525,2
141617,commentisfree/2022/feb/22/johnson-personal-responsibility-living-with-covid-inequality,Opinion,Johnson wants us to take personal responsibility for Covid – but England is left exposed | Christina Pagel,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/johnson-personal-responsibility-living-with-covid-inequality,"On Monday the government announced its “living with Covid” strategy, including a phasing-out of free access to rapid lateral flow tests, reduced access to the more accurate PCR tests for most of those with symptoms, an end to legal requirements to self-isolate and an end to financial support for those on low incomes needing to self-isolate. Announcing the changes, which will come into force on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the time to “compel” people was over. Now “people will be asked to exercise personal responsibility” to look after each other, he said. Health and education leaders and scientists are concerned about the wisdom of phasing out both testing and self-isolation measures at this stage of the pandemic – but given that it is happening, what will the shift in policy mean in practice? What will things look like in the UK over the next year, and how will it affect our ability to deal with Covid-19? Supporters of relaxing the measures have often appealed to individual responsibility – whether that’s to voluntarily self-isolate if positive, or to assess our own appetite for risk and behave accordingly. But this misses the point: there is a limit to what the individual can do with a highly infectious disease. Many might choose to isolate if positive, but that relies on knowing you are positive in the first place, on being able to resist pressure from employers to go in to work, and on being able to afford to stay home (both financially and practically). All three aspects will become much more difficult from now on, and will necessarily put others at risk. And measures individuals can take to protect themselves, such as reducing social contact or wearing high-quality filtering masks (such as the FFP2 grade), depend on knowing what the risk of social contact will be. The government indicated some aspects of Covid surveillance will remain, but with less reliable local data on infections and not having the ability to ask others to test before meeting, such personal choices are taken away from individuals. Once infected, lack of testing will ultimately reduce timely access to antivirals to prevent severe illness (which need to be taken as soon as possible after infection) and to long-term care if long Covid develops. The Sage group believes that part of the reason the peaks in July with Delta and this winter with Omicron were not higher is because people voluntarily restricted their behaviour over and above what was required by legislation. However, this “responsible” behaviour on the part of the public as a whole relies on everyone being able to see that there’s a potential problem. As testing, surveillance and reporting of infection rates are scaled back, this will be much more difficult, and it will be much less likely that enough people will change their behaviour at the same time to dampen down future waves. Almost a year ago I wrote about the danger of Covid becoming a disease of poverty. Under the new policies this danger is exacerbated. A vicious cycle will come into play: those in more deprived areas will be less able to afford to test; less able to afford to voluntarily self-isolate; more likely to live in poor, overcrowded housing and more likely to be exposed outside the home thus more likely to infect others; less likely to be vaccinated but more likely to be in existing ill-health, and so more likely to fall seriously ill and die from Covid and develop long Covid. Ill-health then worsens families’ financial situation again and the cycle perpetuates. Despite the constant comparison to the flu, coronavirus is more infectious than flu and has worse health outcomes (both in terms of death and long-term ill-health). Simply adding it to our population without any policy adaptation may return us to what feels like normal life – but it will be a shorter and sicker one. There is also no doubt that Omicron is not the last variant. As the virus continues to mutate, vaccine efficacy against infection wanes and public health measures are abandoned, it is likely that many people will catch it once or twice a year. This is likely to ultimately reduce overall life expectancy, where the steady gains seen over the last 70 years had already stalled between 2011 and 2018. Sudden waves of infection, like those seen last December and January, will put pressure on the NHS as we add a whole new disease to already challenging winter season. A sizeable percentage of the workforce getting sick at once will also – again – cause significant disruption across education, hospitality, transport and other work places. As for any communal problem, lasting remedies must be communal ones. Societies around the world did just this when they tackled passive smoking through anti-smoking legislation, pollution through environmental legislation and car accidents by drink-driving and road safety legislation. For coronavirus, this means research into better vaccines and treatments, understanding and preventing long Covid, infrastructure investment to support cleaner air, tackling inequalities across their whole range to improve population resilience, and a well-oiled national and global public health strategy that can spring into action when needed. The latter three will be effective against any future airborne pandemics. If we don’t want a world with more illness and death, we need to actively do something to prevent it.

141742,commentisfree/2022/feb/21/boris-johnson-covid-restrictions-england,Opinion,"Johnson’s decision is political, but it’s right to end Covid restrictions in England | Simon Jenkins",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/21/boris-johnson-covid-restrictions-england,"Boris Johnson’s use of apocalyptic demons to aid his survival in office knows no limit. Since his near-death experience of “partygate”, he has shamelessly exploited war, floods and pestilence. All have responded. Pestilence is now his greatest ally. The decision announced today to end all remaining pandemic restriction measures in England goes flatly against his more cautious advisers and appears highly political. That does not make it wrong. The prime duty of government is to protect people from death and disease. After two years of Covid, the most basic measure of that protection is the “excess death rate” from all causes. In England this is now negative, that is, running below the seasonal norm, while Covid-related hospitalisations across the entire UK are falling fast. The crisis is over. Were Covid not in the air, mass testing for, say, infectious flu would seem an excessive precaution, given the government’s claims that it costs an astronomical £2bn a month. Whether this continues apparently remains a matter of argument. It is true that excess deaths also fell a year ago before the return of Covid via the Omicron variant, a return not remotely as serious as previous variants. It was countered by the clearly effective remedy of vaccination. Nonetheless, the return was enough for “the science” to challenge Johnson’s decision to end quarantine requirements and scale back mass testing. He is determined to “return to normal” after two years of national disruption, leaving individuals and organisations to make their own judgments on caution, as with other diseases. Yes, he says, it is a risk, but his job is to judge risks, and sometimes to take them.
In this case Johnson is surely right. Leaving aside vaccination – unquestioned hero of the hour – the external cost of the Covid lockdown has been unquantifiable but appalling. In medicine alone, cancers have gone unreported, with other illnesses untreated and mental health neglected. The money spent on lockdown compensation, much of it reckless and some even corrupt, has been denied to other welfare uses. The cost to child welfare is inestimable, as has been the cost to education. It is, of course, possible that ending mandatory self-isolation may lead to another upturn, though whether this should justify a return of lockdown must be doubted. Support for the clinically vulnerable should remain, and be shored up with new resources. More to the point is that the government – and the country – should now be able to turn its resources and attention to recovering from Covid’s wider damage to the nation’s welfare caused over the past two years. It is worrying how rarely those pleading for continued lockdown refer to this damage. It is as if because a cost is unquantifiable in the short term it does not exist. Too often scientists sound like just another interest group out to protect its reputation and budget. As Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College London modelling group were quoted as admitting: “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression.” It is why Sweden’s decision to avoid a draconian lockdown merits serious analysis. Its GDP fell by 2.9%, Britain’s by 9.4%. In the European league tables Sweden falls around the middle in deaths per capita, still well below Britain. Experts should be on tap, not on top. They should be listened to but not obeyed. We vote for politicians to rule us and no one else, thank goodness. Now Johnson can get back to his other demons, still dancing attendance at his door.

141944,commentisfree/2022/feb/20/tories-death-misery-spending-cuts-covid-labour,Opinion,A post-Covid world is coming into view  – but where is the payback for two years of death and suffering? | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/tories-death-misery-spending-cuts-covid-labour,"This week, England arrives at a moment that will fit the Boris Johnson era to perfection. Even if the pandemic is not quite over – something symbolised by news of the Queen testing positive – everything is being arranged to convince us that it is. On Monday, the prime minister is expected to explain his government’s “living with Covid” strategy, and on Thursday, most remaining Covid rules and restrictions will be lifted. Although Northern Ireland seems to be taking a similar route, Scotland and Wales are once again sticking to more cautious policies, but that is presumably the way Johnson likes it. Here is an opportunity for him to show the libertarian, Brexity backbench hardcore which seems to now run the Conservative party that their home country is blazing a trail towards the dazzling uplands of freedom and easy living, and all is once again well. Clearly, it isn’t. This latest set of moves only highlights a basic fact of life in early 2022 that has been strangely overlooked. Thankfully, the pandemic is winding down, but after two years of sacrifice, bereavement and hurt, there is no sign of any political payback for what people have suffered. The worsening situation in Ukraine may make such talk look rather misplaced, but we were chivvied through the worst of the Covid crisis with endless comparisons to wartime and the supposed glories of the Blitz spirit, our equivalent of “peace” is impossible living costs, cuts to public spending and the inertia of a government completely consumed with its own problems. If the public mood feels almost numb, this is a big part of the reason why. As ever, the everyday state of things is highlighted by the position of city and local government. A new financial year looms, and any extra money from Whitehall does not meet the rising need for the most basic local services, nor cover financial deficits caused by the Covid crisis (a good example is the loss of town and city centre parking charges). So, Nottingham city council has to hack £28m from its spending, and is shutting children’s centres and youth services. In Sheffield, they are reviewing library services and considering cutting vulnerable people’s home care; in Croydon, the council is about to get rid of the council tax support worth up to £29 a week to thousands of the borough’s most vulnerable people. Tory-run Hampshire, meanwhile, is trying to somehow save £80m over two years, which means cuts to children’s social care, work with young offenders, education services and school transport. Through 2020 and 2021, the government endlessly employed a slogan that had been in sporadic circulation for at least 15 years, and was soon adopted by Joe Biden: “Build back better”. Now, at the very point you might have thought those three words would be more ubiquitous than ever, they are nowhere to be seen. We all know that Covid infections and perhaps death rates were made worse by poor and overcrowded homes, but the Conservative approach to the one thing that definitely needs to be built remains as standoffish as ever. Between March 2020 and April last year, about 6,000 homes for social rent were delivered in England, amounting to roughly one for every 190 households stuck on waiting lists. Our Covid death toll highlighted the often appalling state of public health in the UK, but that issue seems to be simply grinding on. During our three national lockdowns, it was briefly fashionable to focus on the huge sacrifices made by children and young people and imagine some kind of programme of reparations, but nothing has materialised. All told, the government’s pandemic story seems to be yet another case study in that very English habit of undergoing trauma and misery, being reminded that everything rests on the ricketiest of foundations, and then pretending nothing has happened. More than ever, Johnson says whatever he thinks suits the moment and then moves on to something else. But even if he was halfway serious about using the state to radically rebalance the economy and society, Rishi Sunak’s Treasury would balk at the kind of spending involved – and in any case, an ideological shift is afoot in the Conservative party that looks likely to jettison even the meek kind of interventionism laid out in the recent “levelling up” white paper. Johnson’s new chief of staff, the MP Steve Barclay, says that the prime minister is now “taking a close look” at how the government can be hacked back, and that “it is a priority to restore a smaller state – both financially and in taking a step back from people’s lives”. For these Tories, the pandemic’s sudden burst of interventionism and collectivist thinking was terrifying: now they are reaching for the rewind button.
Labour clearly has different intentions, but still risks being complicit in Westminster’s state of willed amnesia. Keir Starmer currently seems to be deep into the “I’m not Jeremy Corbyn” stage of his leadership, which is understandable but is also getting in the way of him convincingly speaking to the moment. His three watchwords are “security, prosperity and respect”, all abstract nouns, presumably chosen because they come up in focus groups, but not exactly brimming with meaning or topicality. In a technocratic lingo reminiscent of the 1990s, Labour’s plans for the economy promise a “learning”, “investing”, “innovating” and “trading” Britain, too often omitting the moral aspects of life and work that Covid has pushed to the surface. From time to time, Starmer talks about what we have all been through, but there is still no real sense of a centre-left party confidently speaking to a country reeling from the loss of 180,000 people, and the experience of every aspect of its collective life being upended. If you want to instantly understand the normality we are returning to, consider the weekend’s reports in the Sunday Times about the Conservative party’s “advisory board” of 14 unbelievably wealthy donors, and allegations that some of them lobbied ministers to prematurely relax “measures designed to stop [Covid] transmission”, as well as voicing their opposition to “higher tax for the ultra-rich”. When I read that, I thought straight away of something George Orwell wrote in 1941, about the kind of Tory who believed that when the second world war was over, the country could be pushed “back to ‘democracy’, ie capitalism, back to dole queues and the Rolls-Royce cars, back to the grey top hats and the sponge-bag trousers”. England is a country with a tragic habit of simultaneously being obsessed with tradition and forgetting its own history. It says something about where we have arrived that those words sound less like a blast from the past than a very urgent warning.

141991,commentisfree/2022/feb/20/its-time-to-consider-natural-immunity-to-covid-19-as-equal-to-one-shot-of-the-vaccine,Opinion,Why one-shot after a Covid-19 infection should suffice to be considered fully-vaxxed | Eric Topol,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/its-time-to-consider-natural-immunity-to-covid-19-as-equal-to-one-shot-of-the-vaccine,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has failed to recognize that people with confirmed Covid infections, also known as “natural immunity,” have achieved some level of protection against subsequent infections and severe disease. This has unnecessarily fueled divisiveness, particularly when vaccines are mandated without acknowledgement that prior Covid is an alternate path, albeit with some limitations, for protection of the individual and helping to build the population’s immunity wall. While there has been a body of data supporting a robust immune response to Covid infections, that evidence has recently been substantially bolstered. In the very large trial on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine single shot compared with placebo, among over 2,000 participants with prior infections, as documented by positive antibody status, their protection against moderate or severe disease was 90%. That’s much higher than the vaccine efficacy of 56%, yet the CDC recognizes 2-shot of this vaccine as “fully vaccinated” but ignores these data, and many other proof points, of natural immunity protection. A recent CDC report for Covid in California that included the Delta wave, the cumulative hospitalization rate for the vaccinated was 0.7% among vaccinated and 0.3% unvaccinated with prior infection. Notably, a 10-fold lower risk of subsequent infection was found in the people with natural immunity compared with those vaccinated in the Cleveland Clinic health system’s study of over 52,000 employees. These reports convey a high level of protection of natural immunity, at times comparable to 2-shot vaccines. Multiple studies following people at least 15 months out from Covid infections have shown persistent antibody levels and memory B cells. Reinfections among those with natural immunity throughout the pandemic, until the recent Omicron wave, have been very low, less than 1%. A United Kingdom study of about 9,000 people with prior infections demonstrated higher than 90% protection against subsequent infections, even among those who had Covid more than 18 months previously. If there is good protection from infections, then why is one-shot of a vaccine necessary and sufficient? A new report of nearly 150,000 people with Covid infections in Israel, with about half vaccinated, compared to the others left unvaccinated, there was an 82% lower risk of reinfection for people aged 16 to 64 years, and 60% for age 65 or older. There was no difference for the protection with more than 1-dose of vaccine. The same was found in another study. Both of these were performed during the Delta wave, but now we have data with Omicron, the strain of the virus with the most substantial evasion of our immune system. Substantiating that, In Qatar, while the protection of natural immunity was about 90% for previous Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants, it dropped to 56% for Omicron. In the United Kingdom, the risk of reinfection for people with prior Covid spiked to a level 16-fold what had been seen previously. Yet an Omicron wave study from Cleveland Clinic in about 8,000 people with natural immunity, 1-shot of vaccine markedly reduced the risk of infection and 2 or 3-shots had no incremental protective benefit. That same finding was consistent in the Israel and UK studies: 1-shot did the trick, no added protection from 2 or 3-shots. Indeed, the waning of protection after 1-year in the UK study was averted with one dose of vaccine. Past critique of natural immunity protection is still relevant. These studies have survivor bias—they only include people who survived their infections. We know that the symptoms of Long Covid can be reduced by vaccines, which is an important added feature of the controlled vaccine approach compared with the unpredictable chronic duration sequalae of an infection, which can be disabling, even when they are mild. Although about 90% of people with infections develop antibodies and memory B an T cells, that leaves some without an immune response, which appears to be more of an issue when a person did not have symptoms, or they were very mild. Since we do not assess antibody levels, especially those capable of neutralizing of the virus, and do not measure T cell responses, there is a blind spot in knowing about an individual’s level of protection, be it by infection or vaccination. Which brings us to hybrid immunity. It would be reckless to ever recommend someone get purposely infected with Covid. However, for those who have sustained an infection their immune response was directed to the whole virus whereas our vaccines are specific to the spike-protein. The result of combining the different immune responses is synergy, more than additive, a powerful and durable protection, 25 to 100 times more antibody response and broader against variants of the virus. Note that we do not have the same evidence for the opposite order: vaccination prior to breakthrough infections. It is now clearly overdue for the United States and the CDC to acknowledge natural immunity as a partial path to protection, as has been previously done in several countries. The term “fully vaccinated” needs to be redefined. For people who have received 2 mRNA vaccine shots, without prior infection, a third shot, booster, is needed to protect against symptomatic and severe disease. On the other hand, for people with natural immunity, with proof of a positive PCR test, one-shot is all that is necessary to be considered “fully vaccinated.” By providing immunity certification in this way, the polarization between natural and vaccine-induce immune camps will be bridged, at least to some extent. The evidence has become overwhelming and its adoption as policy will likely help get the low American vaccination rate of 64% , ranked worse than 60 countries in the world, to a much higher level, further building the immunity wall for the whole population. It’s also about sticking to the science when a large and ever-increasing body of data can no longer be ignored. One can fully understand why vaccine mandates would be repudiated when there was evidence of protection conferred by infection. Now, as the virus evolved, we are at a time when natural immunity alone is not sufficient, but with a single shot it’s as good as three.

142217,commentisfree/2022/mar/31/the-guardian-view-on-falling-satisfaction-with-the-nhs-broken-promises,Opinion,The Guardian view on falling satisfaction with the NHS: broken promises | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/31/the-guardian-view-on-falling-satisfaction-with-the-nhs-broken-promises,"To start with, the good news: the British public does not want the NHS to be replaced with an insurance system. Of those questioned for the latest British Social Attitudes survey, 94% support the existence of a health service that is free at the point of delivery and 86% think it should be funded mainly through taxes. But beyond this striking support for the principles that are the service’s bedrock, there is little or no comfort to be found in these results. At 36%, overall satisfaction with the NHS is at its lowest level since 1997. A 17 percentage point fall between 2020 and 2021 in the number who are satisfied is the steepest ever. Troubling though it is to be confronted with such numbers, and the painful reality to which they point – of people not getting the treatment that they need, including for cancer – the crisis now facing the country was not only predictable but predicted. With 7.4 million people on waiting lists for treatment in England, Scotland and Wales, a huge proportion of the population is now being directly affected by delays. Coupled with the publication of Donna Ockenden’s distressing report into failings in maternity care by the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, the research is rightly prompting widespread alarm. The crisis engulfing the system due to long-term underinvestment must not, of course, be elided with the specific events in Shrewsbury. The Ockenden report uncovers appalling failures of management, culture and practice, and concludes that the lives of 201 babies and nine women were needlessly lost. That the investigation took place at all was only down to the courage of the families, in particular those of two babies who died soon after birth – Pippa Griffiths and Kate Stanton Davies. Their parents began the work of collecting other cases. Poor care in Shropshire was compounded by a deadly unwillingness to admit to mistakes, while the hospital became gripped by an erroneous belief in its own success based on a low rate of caesarian deliveries. An adversarial culture, with midwives and doctors in opposing camps, contributed to multiple errors, including a lack of foetal heartbeat monitoring. But while it is essential to note what is distinctive about these findings, resemblances must also be heeded – for example, to failings in maternity care at Morecambe Bay and East Kent. Poor training, staff shortages and weak management are all cited as contributory factors by the Ockenden report. There is no suggestion that all patients face the same risks as pregnant women in Shrewsbury did. But nor are these problems the unique features of a handful of maternity departments. While the current shortage of 2,000 midwives in England is particularly acute, there are rising numbers of vacancies across the NHS and in primary care as well as hospitals. Making it easier to get a GP appointment was the single most popular answer to the question of how the NHS could be improved, cited by 48% of respondents to the British Social Attitudes survey. Boris Johnson fought the 2019 election with a raft of promises to improve the health service. While new investment is being made following years of cuts, specific pledges have not been met. Waiting-time targets that are supposed to be legally binding are broken as a matter of course. Covid is of course a factor in all this, as the public understands. But it is not the only one. With a 184-bed private hospital due to open shortly in London, while the number of NHS vacancies skyrockets, ministers are – through their actions if not their words – showing a preference for the kind of tiered health system that the public rejected in the 1940s. Conservative MPs were whipped to vote against an amendment to recent health legislation that would have made workforce planning a legal requirement. With millions of people queueing for treatment, and suffering while they do it, ministers must support the NHS to meet the needs of the public – as the public demands.",2022-03-31 17:45:17+00:00,142218,16
142365,commentisfree/2022/mar/31/charging-covid-tests-england-infections,Opinion,Charging for Covid tests in England just as infections surge? This is an act of national self-sabotage | Frances Ryan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/31/charging-covid-tests-england-infections,"They call it April Fools’ Day for a reason. From tomorrow, 1 April, Boris Johnson’s government will end the provision of free lateral flow and PCR tests for the majority of people in England. Ministers have announced that only a limited number of groups will now have access without having to pay. That includes symptomatic hospital patients when it is required for their care, and people living or working in “high-risk settings” such as care homes and prisons. Free asymptomatic testing will remain available for care home and patient-facing staff in the NHS, but only when there is a high prevalence of the virus and it is determined that infections may spread quickly. By ending free testing just as coronavirus infection rates soar – and a cost of living crisis leaves people without spare cash – the government is creating a perfect storm for illness. People will now be in the dark as to whether they have the virus, unless they can afford a test or choose to buy one, and could go into public spaces while infected, spreading the virus to people they would previously have protected by self-isolating. The public health messaging is clear enough: don’t worry about Covid any more, but if you insist on bothering, you can pay for a test yourself. Or as Sajid Javid, the health secretary, put it: now that free testing has ended, people with Covid symptoms should “socialise a bit less”.
With the partygate scandal back on the political agenda, it may be in Johnson’s best interests to pretend that coronavirus is old news, but it is in no one else’s. Scientists have been all too clear on the likely consequences of ending free testing: increased infection rates, extra pressure on an already struggling NHS, more people getting long Covid, delays in detecting new variants. Also bear in mind that ministers have just axed funding for our world-leading infection tracker system. The government claims that its testing plan will at least still protect the most vulnerable to coronavirus – but it appears that the majority of clinically vulnerable people, and the people they come into contact with, will not be eligible. Some high-risk people who need to have Covid treatments, such as antivirals, will be granted free tests, but government guidelines say they are only to be used once they are ill and already showing symptoms. It’s the public health equivalent of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. This fundamentally misses what has been so valuable about large-scale testing over the past two years: it’s not that high-risk people can see if they have Covid, but that those they’re due to come into contact with can. It is good news that ministers have relented and will not just test NHS and care home staff when they have symptoms, but it’s concerning that asymptomatic frontline workers will be left untested outside times of vaguely defined “high prevalence”. Public sector workers enduring real-term pay cuts can hardly be expected to pay for regular tests themselves, and it is negligent to tell patients they should be treated by an untested medic. Roughly a third of people who have coronavirus don’t show any symptoms, and hospitals – which are by their nature frequented by sick and vulnerable people – will always be areas of high risk of infection. It is not enough for an asthmatic mum to worry about catching Covid in the shops, bus and classroom – now she has to risk it from her respiratory nurse. The government’s plan commits to testing care home staff, but there is little word on carers and personal assistants who work in the community, many of whom go into multiple disabled and older people’s homes each day. Nor is there any help for unpaid carers, despite them largely living in poverty and already worried about going out and bringing back germs to their vulnerable family member. Putting the financial burden of testing on to disabled people and their families during an energy crisis, which will itself hit people with disabilities hard, is outright cruelty. In the coming weeks, vulnerable care users will be forced to choose between buying an LFT to keep well and paying energy bills to keep warm. There is also little help in the plan for people visiting elderly or disabled relatives in care homes, except a pledge that asymptomatic testing will remain available to “a small number of care home visitors who provide personal care”. Care home visitors may end up having to pay about £73 a month just to see loved ones, according to the Alzheimer’s Society, or else risk walking in being potentially contagious. Ministers’ infamous “protective ring” around care homes seems to have cracked once again. From the very beginning of the pandemic, there have been voices seeking to downplay the threat of the virus to falsely suggest that protective measures are both restrictive and unnecessary. In many ways, the end of free testing is the ultimate example of this narrative. Not content with low sick pay, no mandated masks or ending the legal duty to isolate with Covid, England is about to abandon a public health tool that has undoubtedly saved many lives in the pandemic. That this is being done just as hospital admissions from Covid rise again is a national act of self-sabotage. Some will say “we can’t afford testing”, but common sense says we cannot afford not to. The cost of increased hospitalisations as well as the fallout of long Covid will probably dwarf any testing costs; lateral flow tests make up a tiny fraction of the £2bn testing budget. Others will praise ditching LFTs as a sign of liberty restored, although it’s unlikely that this cohort will include the clinically vulnerable. Those who want their “freedom” will need to explain what it is exactly about access to universal healthcare that is so restrictive. Ultimately, there is a choice: embrace the low-restriction, preventive measures that enable us all to get back to normal life as safely as possible, or accept uncontrolled transmission of the virus. The path taken reflects the extent to which the government really believes that every life matters. When it comes to that particular test, they have certainly failed.

142561,world/commentisfree/2022/mar/30/long-covid-coronavirus-covid-pandemic-health,Opinion,We need answers to these four long Covid questions | Charlie McCone,https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/mar/30/long-covid-coronavirus-covid-pandemic-health,"Hi. My name is Charlie, and long Covid has destroyed my life. Before my “mild infection”, I was a healthy, fit 30-year-old, biking 10 miles a day with no prior health issues, the type of person the CDC says should bounce back after two weeks. Well, it’s been two years and I’ve yet to bounce back. I can’t work or leave the house, and I rely on my partner as a full-time caretaker. I still can’t breathe right. It is a living nightmare. Writing this piece would have taken me an evening before I was sick, but now this level of cognitive exertion takes an entire week to complete. There are millions suffering through this every day, stuck in a twilight zone of never-ending debilitating symptoms for months, and now years, after infection. And with a reported 10-30% of infections leading to this condition, we are witnessing the greatest mass disabling event in human history – the scale of which demands the same “Operation Warp Speed” type of urgency that was given to acute Covid and the development of vaccines. This is still a new disease, and it will take time to understand everything. However, research is quickly unraveling the disease process, and it is no longer a “complete mystery”. So while we can only push science so fast, here are my four questions about the treatment, support and prevention of long Covid. 1. Why don’t we have diagnostics yet for microclots? “Great news – all your labs look normal” is the dreaded phrase long Covid patients hear repeatedly from their medical team, and often leads to a minimization and dismissal of their symptoms. Current clinical diagnostics have proven insufficient for the diagnosis and treatment of long Covid (along with other longstanding post viral illnesses such as ME/CFS). However, the latest research is developing dozens of new diagnostic methods that have identified explicit biological abnormalities in the long Covid disease process. Among the most promising is the detection of amyloid microclots using fluorescence microscopes. In research studies so far, they have been detected in 100% of patients tested for them. This is a simple blood draw that could provide a critical biomarker for millions, and it has immediate implications for treatment. In fact, the process is so simple that patients are sneaking into labs after hours to have technicians run the test for them. Why can’t long Covid clinics begin incorporating this simple lab draw into their suite of services? If you run a clinic and are reading this, email this link to your lab director right now, and ask them: “Can we run this test?” There is a good chance they will say yes. When this research around microclots was published last summer, I was optimistic we’d have some form of treatment option by early 2022, or at least a new diagnostic. We can’t continue to go through this health crisis with significant scientific breakthroughs sitting on the shelf for six months and more without any attempt at replication, trial or action. We need to prioritize expediting these newly discovered diagnostics into the clinical setting now. 2. Why is there still no public health warning? We’ve known for well over a year how prevalent and severe long Covid is, yet the public remains largely uninformed around its risk. While the likelihood of someone developing the condition after infection has ranged from 5% or 50% (a recent meta-analysis pins it to 20-30%, and 10% if vaccinated), the most conservative estimate still amounts to one in 20 people. A “medically rare event” is one in 1,000. As the Mayo Clinic research team recently said, regardless of where the final number ends up, “this is a condition that is not rare.” So why are we not warning the public? If public health institutions want to establish trust with the public, they need to be honest about what the science is telling us. Right now they are not – and their silence around long Covid can be described as misinformation around the risk of infection – which is no different than anti-vaccination misinformation around the risk of vaccines. In addition, studies demonstrate informing the public about long Covid encourages them to follow public health guidelines, and reduces vaccine hesitancy. So what’s going on? Let me take a guess: it would be difficult to promote a policy of “endemic infection that resembles a mild seasonal flu” while simultaneously warning the public that one in 10 infected will go on to develop a chronic illness, regardless of infection severity. In other words, it doesn’t fit nicely with a strategy of unmitigated spread where we are “living with Covid”. Any decision that ignores long Covid at the cost of a humming economy and “returning to normal” is not only immoral and craven, it’s severely flawed. Long Covid is already having a devastating impact on the economy: in the US, the most conservative estimates are that 1.6 million are already out of the workforce due to long Covid, and in the UK, a quarter of employers cite it as a leading reason for long-term absence. So if we want folks to participate in a working economy and retain a normal way of life, we need to protect them by informing them about the risk of infection. It’s long overdue to acknowledge and count long Covid, and begin measuring this pandemic in deaths, hospitalizations and disability. 3. Why haven’t we started meaningful treatment trials for long Covid? I am enrolled in the “Recover” trial led by the National Institutes of Health, and during the orientation, they informed me that “the first few years will be observational, and then we hope to begin considering treatments after that”. Do we have time to wait two years or more until meaningful treatment trials begin for a disease that is affecting 10-30% of the globally infected population? There are already dozens of promising case studies that have identified treatments in response to clear biological abnormalities: viral persistence, immune dysregulation, endothelial dysfunction, auto-antibodies, and the aforementioned microclots – all of which should have already prompted trials. This is where patients are genuinely confused. Lack of action doesn’t make sense economically, politically, or medically. We have enough data and research on the disease process to begin fast-tracking small-scale trials today. Multi-year observational studies are not going to cut it. Patients continue to go to their doctors and share the promising case studies being published every month, and the only response is: “We need trials before we can consider this treatment.” OK, where are the trials? 4. What is the plan to support those who’ve lost their jobs & housing due to long Covid? My short-term disability runs out soon, and I have no clue what I’m going to do – and I am fortunate enough to have a supportive job and family, good health insurance, and a team of doctors who understand the severity of this condition. Many are not so fortunate. We know long Covid is destroying careers, pushing teachers and first responders into homelessness, and completely upending the financial security of families across the globe. Long-term disability is now being flooded and is denying benefits to the majority of patient applicants. This is a disaster. Nobody asked for this condition, nor were they warned about its possibility, and now sufferers are being hung out to dry with no support from one of the greatest fallouts of this pandemic. We know pandemics disable people, and policymakers should have been prepared for this. What is the plan here? So while we can only push the research so fast, that is not stopping us from addressing the most immediate needs of those suffering from long Covid or to protect others from developing the condition. It’s clear we’re waiting for our governments, medical and public health institutions, and the media, to catch up with the science. What are we waiting for?

142619,commentisfree/2022/mar/30/nhs-satisfaction-no-10-covid-pandemic,Opinion,There has been a huge drop in NHS satisfaction levels – but don’t let No 10 blame Covid | Andy Cowper,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/30/nhs-satisfaction-no-10-covid-pandemic,"If you’re making a list of Things That Are Not Surprising, then today’s news that public satisfaction with the NHS has fallen to its lowest level since 1997, as revealed in the 2021 British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey, might be near the top. Satisfaction with the health service has plummeted, with just 36% declaring they are content. In the previous year’s survey, this figure was 53%. Such a 17-point drop is unprecedented over the history of this multi-decade census. More people (41%) are now dissatisfied with the NHS than satisfied, and this holds across all ages, income groups, sexes and political persuasions. It’s worth pointing out that you almost didn’t know about this. As part of the coalition government’s disastrous health reforms of 2010-12, Andrew Lansley removed the Department of Health’s funding for this survey. You don’t have to be politically partisan to wonder why a government department would want less public knowledge about satisfaction with its remit. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the health economist Professor John Appleby and colleagues, this source of data wasn’t lost: the independent King’s Fund thinktank stepped in to sponsor it. In any case, the causes of the collapse in NHS performance, which the public has clearly noticed, are not mysterious. But here’s the key thing: they can’t be entirely attributed to the pandemic. Clearly, Covid-19 didn’t help matters, with its huge impact of fatigue and trauma on the staff who battled through its waves. But it is a matter of fact that at the end of 2019 (ie before the pandemic), the NHS waiting list in England was 4.4 million people long. It is currently 6.1 million and rising, having grown from 2.4 million in 2015. The point is that Covid did not help with a pre-existing trend. The single biggest cause of the fall in performance is a lack of resources. The decade from 2010-19 saw the lowest increase in NHS funding since the first decade of the service’s history. The Cameron-Osborne austerity era has been very costly. The most important resource is, of course, NHS staff. The fact that the workforce shortage recently hit 110,000 (after having hovered around 100,000 for several years) is not reassuring; neither is the government’s continuing unwillingness to accept former health secretary Jeremy Hunt’s proposal to mandate a regular independent publication of NHS workforce needs, and the progress being made to meet them. When the current health bill returns to the House of Commons later this week, expect to see battle resume on this issue. The willingness of doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff to work overtime in evenings and at weekends to tackle the backlog (which happened under New Labour too) is also being hit by pension tax changes introduced by Osborne to offset the costs of making family homes worth up to £1m free of inheritance tax. This means that NHS staff working overtime can become liable for unpredictable and huge tax bills, which must be paid immediately, and which can exceed the extra money earned. So what is the government going to do to fix all this? The answer is, frankly, nothing. The NHS elective recovery plan recently announced by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, will not fix the backlog. It is a masterpiece of evasive language, characterised by lots of “ambition”, “guidance” and “best practice”. So creating 30% more NHS elective capacity over pre-pandemic levels by 2024-25 is an “aim”. Other aims include to “make progressive improvements on long waits, with a goal to eliminate waits of over one year by March 2025, and waits of over two years by July 2022”. All this allows for a lot of wriggle-room, obviously. In the same vein, there are commitments that by March 2025 (which lies beyond the latest date for the next general election), there will be no 52-week waits for elective care. But, again, we soon get to caveats: “These ambitions are important for improving outcomes for patients, but they of course depend on returning to and maintaining low levels of Covid-19, enabling the NHS to restore normalised operating conditions and reduce high levels of staff absence”. Covid-19 is still very much with us, along with restrictions on NHS capacity because of infection control measures. The BSA survey has some good news: the vast majority expressed high levels of support for the founding principles of the NHS: that it is free of charge when you need it (94%), primarily funded through taxation (87%) and available to everyone (84%). And we know from the New Labour health reforms of the 2000s that the NHS is perfectly capable of delivering on increasing access and reducing waiting lists, if it is adequately resourced. Let’s end with a prediction: expect some on the political right to come out shroud-waving that the NHS just can’t deliver. For all of the above reasons, we can safely ignore such foolish assertions. The NHS is in its current bad state of health because of the culmination of political choices, over the past dozen years, made by Conservative-led governments. The next general election, which the chancellor’s promised 1p income tax cut effectively guarantees will be in 2024, will be a referendum on many things: the state of the NHS will be high up on that list.

142684,commentisfree/2022/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-pandemic-the-price-of-zero-covid,Opinion,The Guardian view on China’s pandemic: the price of zero-Covid | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-pandemic-the-price-of-zero-covid,"More than two years after China imposed the world’s first Covid-19 lockdown, in response to the virus’s emergence in Wuhan, tens of millions are stuck at home once more. With cases at their highest since early 2020, the leadership is wedded to its zero-Covid strategy. For much of the pandemic, it allowed most people to live without restrictions within the country’s borders, and it certainly saved countless lives. Officially, mainland China’s death toll has remained under 5,000, despite a population of more than 1.3 billion; the UK, with 67 million inhabitants, has seen 165,000 deaths. But vaccines have offered an alternative, the transmissibility of Omicron makes it less feasible in the long term, and the economic and human costs are becoming less tolerable. Officials are now struggling to straddle two diverging goals: to control infections while shoring up the economy – one new study suggests lockdowns are costing at least $46bn a month. A “dynamic zero-Covid” approach of targeted restrictions, mass testing and isolation seeks to allow the swift relaxation of controls and minimisation of disruption and economic shock. Its biggest test to date may have arrived. Early on Monday, Shanghai – the country’s financial centre and home to 25 million residents – began a two-stage lockdown. The half of the city east of the Huangpu river is under tight restrictions until Friday, with mass testing (8 million in one day reportedly) and isolation of those found to be positive; it is then due to reopen while the other half closes. The leap in cases should be put into context. Earlier this year, China was reporting fewer than 100 cases a day; the 5,000-plus recorded on Monday are still a long way short of the 42,000 reported in the US that day. But Hong Kong, which earlier this month had the worst death rate in the world – recording more deaths per day than it had in the whole of the pandemic until then – has shown how quickly an outbreak can escalate. On the mainland, vaccination rates among older people are better, but the over-80s in particular are poorly protected. Reliance on a less effective homemade vaccine has come at a cost (intriguingly, there are reports that Shanghai is now supporting the import of Pfizer vaccines, though the decision will be Beijing’s). China may also be a victim of its own disease-control success, with people simply assuming they won’t encounter Covid. Though experts are clearly keen to edge away from zero-Covid, Beijing is unlikely to abandon the strategy before the year’s end (let alone admit to doing so). One reason is scientific: by then, China hopes to have more effective domestically produced vaccines. But the primary factor is political: this autumn will see the Communist party’s national congress, where it is assumed that Xi Jinping will break precedent by claiming a third five-year term as general secretary of the party. Social stability is paramount until then. So the country is likely to creep towards living with the virus long after others have cast off all restrictions. If that reflects an excess of caution, it also speaks to recklessness elsewhere. Living with Covid is not the same thing as pretending it does not exist. A calibration of measures makes more sense than an all-or-nothing approach. Free testing, decent sick pay, ongoing investment in prevalence studies, masking in spaces such as public transport, and improved ventilation would all help to keep rates down and protect the vulnerable. Britain, which has also seen infections surge in the last month, should take heed.",2022-03-29 17:39:59+00:00,142685,2
142806,commentisfree/2022/mar/29/breast-cancer-no-symptoms-routine-mammogram-saved-life-covid,Opinion,"I have breast cancer, but had no symptoms. A routine mammogram saved my life | Dawn Butler",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/breast-cancer-no-symptoms-routine-mammogram-saved-life-covid,"Being told you have cancer is one of the biggest shocks you can go through. The coronavirus pandemic and cancer are a nasty combination. All the normal support, even if it’s just a big hug, is something you need but are deprived of. But the main thing is catching breast cancer early and I was lucky enough to do that. We have had it drummed into us that we should “CoppaFeel”, so that whatever your age or gender you are aware of the symptoms of breast cancer, feel for lumps and look for changes in your breasts. But what happens if none of that applies and you still have cancer? That’s what happened to me. The truth is a routine mammogram saved my life. I had no symptoms whatsoever but because of a mammogram in November last year, doctors discovered my cancer early. This early diagnosis means that I’ll make a full recovery. Sadly there are many women whose cancer will go undetected, or only be detected too late. The charity Breast Cancer Now estimates that about one million women in the UK missed appointments for mammogram screenings due to Covid-19. And about 8,600 women could be living with undiagnosed breast cancer after missing out on the screening. The NHS Breast Screening Programme invites all women from the age of 50 to 70 for screening every three years. But all screening was effectively paused in March 2020 because of the pandemic, and now women have sadly fallen through the cracks. Although it’s since resumed, there are big delays as the NHS works through a backlog of people who weren’t able to get an appointment. When breast cancer is only detected at a later stage, it can be harder to treat. I’m deeply concerned about this, and I urge anyone who has symptoms to contact their GP straight away. But also, those of you who do not have symptoms: please don’t leave it too late. Book a routine appointment and get checked now. I would also like to make a specific appeal to other women of colour to please take it up, as we know that uptake of cancer screening is lower among this group. Research by Cancer Research UK and Public Health England found that black women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer as white women, in part because of lower screening uptake. The incredible NHS doctors, nurses and staff will be there to help, as they were with me. I am telling my story to raise awareness and so that other women can be alert and take up their mammogram whether they have symptoms or not. Hopefully the more we talk about it, the less of a struggle it will be for some people to cope. I’m hoping that by talking about this publicly, I can make a dent in the million women who have missed appointments and help save lives.

142830,commentisfree/2022/mar/29/herd-immunity-covid-minimisers-sabotaging-pandemic-progress,Opinion,"From ‘herd immunity’ to today, Covid minimisers are still sabotaging our pandemic progress | William Hanage",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/herd-immunity-covid-minimisers-sabotaging-pandemic-progress,"So, is that it? After wave upon wave of infections, the combination of vaccination and Omicron’s comparatively mild (though still serious) properties has led the UK to declare the pandemic, essentially, over. After two lockdowns, a huge burden on healthcare and at last an extremely prompt and effective vaccination campaign, the UK has still registered more than 160,000 lives lost to the pandemic, roughly half of them in the Alpha wave. And in case you hadn’t noticed, “herd immunity”, much like Godot, has stubbornly failed to arrive and expel the virus from the population. Nobody should be under any illusion: it could have been much worse. Poor Peru was hit by dreadful waves of infection before vaccines could be deployed; it has lost roughly three times as many people as the UK, accounting for population. It should be astonishing given these facts, but some stubborn voices have continued to argue that in the autumn of 2020 we should have rushed to remove restrictions on all except those most at risk – who would be somehow saved by untested, implausible means gathered together under the heading of “targeted protection”. At that point no vaccines were widely available, and the effective therapies we now have against Covid were pie in the sky. Shockingly, there are now attempts to rehabilitate these ideas in parts of the media.
Reaching back to relitigate such already-discredited approaches is nonsense. And worse, it makes reasonable discussions about pandemic management that much harder. Distraction has always been the goal of such revisionism. We saw this around targeted protection, we saw it in early arguments that Covid was “just the flu”, we saw it when many people were still arguing that PCR tests were overcounting cases in the UK in the fall of 2020, even as hospital beds and ventilator wards filled up and the death toll steadily mounted. The point of all those fights was to play down the seriousness of the disease and ultimately to blunt our response to it. It started with saying the pandemic wasn’t a real threat, and, when that became undeniable, it became about declaring it over or past, again and again. As I wrote in April 2020, instead of a single peak, we got a mountain range. Ultimately, these arguments – despite being lost individually – seriously hampered the possibility of a real, sustainable strategy emerging to help us handle the grim pandemic terrain. To want a sustainable strategy is not about being a “Covid hawk”. March 2022 is very different from October 2020. To suggest that restrictions might be relaxed once vaccination has been deployed is a reasonable discussion. Before that point it was guaranteed to lead to more preventable transmission, more serious illness, more hospitalisations and more deaths. How our pandemic response should change is a question I get asked all the time. And my answer is always the same: what do we want to achieve? The minimum is to avoid healthcare being overwhelmed. But healthcare gets compromised when things like elective surgeries and screening are delayed – which will happen if huge numbers of staff and patients are sick. And this has indeed happened, over and again, as a result of uncontrolled transmission of the virus in the community.
Here’s a basic pandemic strategy fit for 2022: maintain awareness of the situation with cross-sectional testing of the population to determine how much virus is around, and combine it with wastewater surveillance to spot any rapid changes. Aggressively investigate any new variants because we can expect them, and they could still make a lot of people sick, fast. Make sure people who are in a vulnerable category get treatment early in infection, when it is most likely to help. Above all, emphasise being “up to date” with your vaccination status rather than “fully vaccinated” or “boosted” because we don’t know what might be needed in future. And we should not forget other effective measures that we have known about for ages. More than a century and a half ago, we started to think seriously about cleaning the water we drank, after repeated cholera epidemics, and infections like typhoid whose victims included Queen Victoria’s Prince Albert in 1861. We could do the same for the air we breathe now with better ventilation. What about improved sick pay? It enables people who are infectious with Covid or anything else to not infect people in the workplace, by staying at home. These interventions would blunt future pandemics of respiratory infections. And they would help in the autumn and winter of this year, when Covid and influenza will be tussling for pole position. Hell, you don’t need to talk about future pandemics to advocate for the benefits of such structural change, it’s clear right now. After almost all interventions were removed, the UK has been predictably buffeted by a wave of BA.2 infections. For now, it appears that the disease is comfortingly similar to BA.1, by which I mean readily handled by the great majority of vaccinated folks. But to insist that future variants will be similar is a gamble, not a policy. Rather than maintaining its world-beating scientific effort to understand the properties of the variants as they emerge, the UK is scaling back funding. It doesn’t end because you want it to. Every time you’ve heard a voice state it’s time to “live with the virus” remember that doesn’t mean doing nothing about it. • This article was amended on 31 March 2022 to give typhoid, not cholera, as the cause of Prince Albert’s death.

142977,commentisfree/2022/mar/28/no-covid-approach-bad-press-but-worked,Opinion,"The ‘zero-Covid’ approach got bad press, but it worked – and it could work again  | Laura Spinney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/no-covid-approach-bad-press-but-worked,"It was the alt-history, the policy that didn’t get enacted. No-Covid, zero-Covid or elimination aimed to stamp out community transmission of Covid-19 in a given area, rather than just reduce it to “manageable” levels. Most of the world eschewed it, and it got bad press from the start. Only autocratic regimes could pull it off, one mantra went. Countries like China and ah, New Zealand and, oops, that notorious police state Davis in California. There was something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about this. Many people thought No-Covid was impossible, but the handful of places that embraced it proved them wrong. Now that some of those places are themselves shifting to a reduction or mitigation strategy, countries that opted for mitigation from the beginning are enjoying a “we told you so” moment. But No-Covid’s early champions had to shift in part because other countries let the virus rip. Even if their strategy didn’t remain the optimal one, it bought them time to prepare others. It’s important that we remember that when the next pandemic sidles along. The power of language is terrifying sometimes. We talk about pandemics “erupting” – I’ve done it myself – but sidling seems a more appropriate verb for something that grows quietly in the dark before exploding into the light. The concept of exponential growth is one we have trouble grasping, yet grasping it empowers us. It means that for a time the disease spread is limited and potentially controllable. It means that explosive growth falls off rapidly once it is deprived of fuel. And it means that not everybody has to pursue elimination for it to succeed – as long as a critical mass do.
No-Covid was dogged by problems of definition. People confused elimination with eradication, for example. Only one human disease, smallpox, has been eradicated, but plenty have been eliminated. The UK was measles-free until 2017, when partly, due to low vaccine uptake, it lost that status. Elimination is not an unattainable dream, but it does require a concerted effort. In the current pandemic, the word often applied to such efforts was “restrictions”, as if the efforts themselves deprived us of liberty. No. The virus deprives us of liberty; the efforts preserve it. That’s why nobody in Davis is complaining, 18 months into their No-Covid experiment, and why they’re puzzled other US towns haven’t followed suit. Though lockdowns might have been necessary in the beginning, because we had no other shields against the virus, they soon stopped being synonymous with elimination. Cheap mass testing plus isolation of the infected, ventilation, masking, distancing and – importantly – social and financial support for those inconvenienced by these measures, became the preferred tools, used most effectively in combination. The claim that elimination exacerbates inequality is a red herring; it doesn’t, with the right support. A circulating virus certainly does, on the other hand, by preferentially encountering gig workers, keeping kids out of school, and closing mental health clinics. It’s true that some diseases are easier to eliminate than others. Many western countries assumed that Covid would behave like flu, and decided that elimination would be too difficult. China assumed that it would behave like Sars, which it successfully beat 20 years ago. It actually behaves a bit like both, but not exactly like either. Countries tended to get the outcome they aimed for. Last June, a study in The Lancet showed that those that chose elimination over mitigation did a better job of protecting life, the economy and civil liberties – the hat-trick. But no country is an island to a highly transmissible virus – even those that are islands – and the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, combined with the rollout of vaccines that protect against severe disease and death, was bound to change the calculus. Some who favoured elimination previously now think it has outlived its usefulness. New Zealand, for example, has switched to a mitigation strategy. Epidemiologist Michael Baker expects his country’s high levels of vaccination will protect it from a wave of hospitalisations and deaths as Omicron sweeps the country. Hong Kong, which also pursued No-Covid until recently, has tragically not avoided that fate, due to its relatively low vaccination rates. The lesson from Hong Kong is not that elimination doesn’t work, it’s that you need a plan B in case the context changes. Baker and economist Donald Low, who has chronicled Hong Kong’s experience, agree that elimination was the right strategy for the first 18 months of the pandemic. Baker stands by his analysis of December 2020 that, “Elimination might be the preferred strategy for responding to new emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential and moderate to high severity, particularly while key parameters are being estimated.” What we’re learning about long Covid – or post-Covid-19 condition as the World Health Organization (WHO) now calls it – only strengthens that case, since it’s looking increasingly likely that countries that tolerated high infection rates, including the UK, are facing a sizeable burden of long-term disability. The vaccines do not stop transmission completely, and by abandoning the non-pharmaceutical interventions that do, those countries also increase the likelihood – far from trivial, as scientists highlighted again this month – that a variant more severe than Omicron or its “stealth” subvariant could arise. These emerging facts demonstrate how pointless it is to cost elimination, or any other containment strategy. How do you measure what it has saved you? In speculative fiction terms, what’s the counterfactual? The right way to respond to an unknown disease is to fix a goal and work towards it, adjusting your strategy as you learn. Because there’s another unknown in the equation, human determination, no response should be ruled out initially. As Nelson Mandela said, and the WHO itself likes to quote: “It’s only impossible until it’s done.” Laura Spinney is a science journalist and the author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World",2022-03-28 12:22:57+00:00,142978,2
143034,commentisfree/2022/mar/28/uk-cant-rely-on-boosters-new-wave-covid,Opinion,Why the UK can’t rely on boosters to get through each new wave of Covid | Danny Altmann,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/uk-cant-rely-on-boosters-new-wave-covid,"This time in 2020, we watched with horror as the realities of the pandemic and its death toll unfurled. Most hardly dared imagine that effective vaccines might appear in a fraction of the time taken for previous efforts, effectively stemming the pandemic tide. But despite the success of the vaccines in greatly reducing the odds of hospitalisation or death, viral evolution had plenty more to throw at us. The onslaught of highly immune-evasive variants was, for most of us in immunology and virology, unforeseen. We’d come to think of the coronavirus family as being rather more stable – less error-prone in terms of mutations – than many viruses. And we had never before had to roll out relatively new ways of developing vaccines, involving mRNA or recombinant adenoviruses, at this scale and in the heat of battle. Having started out brilliantly, the real-life state of play today is self-evidently suboptimal. The vaccines rapidly induce hugely high levels of protective, neutralising antibodies in most people, but these levels wane within months of each sequential dose. Meanwhile, Omicron and the subvariant BA.2 have managed to mutate almost every amino acid residue targeted by protective antibodies, escaping protection. And so you have the unhappy equilibrium currently endured by the UK: more than 300,000 new cases a day, as of late last week, and a continuing caseload of more than 3 million, with hospital admissions and excess deaths holding steady at a new – high – setpoint. All this despite one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. We are living in a precarious truce imposed through frequent mRNA boosters to keep the viral caseload “manageable”. But there are signs this isn’t sustainable, and that a strategy simply consisting of boosters in perpetuity may not be fit for purpose. Recent case surges in Hong Kong, Denmark and Scotland emphasise the fragility of that balance. And new evidence from the past two years suggests that encounters with different variants of Covid or different vaccine types can alter the effectiveness of later jabs in surprising ways – an effect called immune imprinting. This raises the possibility that booster performance could be even less predictable and effective in the future. Sars-CoV-2 began as a single variant, which we term the Wuhan strain. But we now inhabit a world where no two people share precisely the same exposure history: we have never been infected, or were asymptomatically, mildly or severely infected during any or a combination of the Wuhan to Alpha, Delta, Omicron or BA.2 waves, and we’ve all had somewhere from zero to four doses of diverse vaccines. The combination of these exposures gives each of us a unique immune memory repertoire. Imagine a huge jar of pills of different colours, each especially good for responding to a given present or future variant. Someone whose experience has been an Alpha infection plus three doses of Pfizer may have brilliantly built up lots of green pills at the expense of others. But this is less good for you if the next variant mainly needs yellow pills. It turns out the order and type of exposure can affect how our immune system responds later on. In a recent paper reported in the journal Science, we compared protective immunity between people infected in the first wave with the original strain and in the second wave with the Alpha variant. In second wave-infected people, encounters with an Alpha infection plus two vaccine doses gave lower protective (known as neutralising) antibody responses against the Wuhan and Beta variant, yet higher responses against Delta. Given the number of vaccines and strains, these interactions are unpredictable, but will shape how our immunity holds for future waves. It needs more investigation. These are complex problems demanding careful research, long-term planning, trials and even some intelligent crystal ball-gazing. We must evaluate many approaches. Some places have announced a fourth dose rollout for first generation Pfizer vaccines (which cross-neutralises recent variants, but very suboptimally); some vaccine makers have pivoted to targeting the Omicron spike; others are working on polyvalent vaccines to include several different versions of spike, or clever structural approaches to target those parts of spike that would be the same across all past and future variants, and maybe even across those coronaviruses still awaiting crossover from bats and pangolins.
This latter approach is exciting and the subject of recent efforts across many teams, including research trials through the US National Institutes of Health and at Cambridge University. There are also advanced programmes considering intranasal – nose – vaccination to achieve local mucosal immunity, increasing the chances of blocking transmission at that site altogether, and vaccine platforms that could be much more durable. The take-home message is that the pandemic is very much with us and evolving dynamically, with a long, bumpy road ahead. The option to sleepwalk through this, taking automatic-pilot choices based on what was “good enough” in the first wave is one we adopt at our peril. We must look at options besides simply boosting through every successive wave. At a time when the US has cut future vaccine research funding, and the UK also needs to maintain its momentum, this should be an urgent priority.

143765,commentisfree/2022/mar/24/countries-covid-trust-damage-pandemic,Opinion,We’ve found one factor that predicts which countries best survive Covid | Thomas Hale,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/24/countries-covid-trust-damage-pandemic,"In 2019, the Global Health Security Index published a report ranking countries on their preparedness for pandemics. The US scored highest, followed by the UK. Two years later, both countries rank among those with the greatest loss of life from Covid. How could this be? A large part of the answer is trust. Countries that looked good on paper in 2019, such as the US, UK, Spain and Slovenia, found they lacked this intangible but critical layer of defence. And this figure from our research over the past two years at the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker shows it in stark terms. On the left (see below) you can see that a higher global health security score in 2019 is not correlated with fewer deaths during the pandemic, at least among the countries whose health systems have a minimum threshold of capacity.
But on the right, we see that a far better predictor of how many people would die – or survive – during the pandemic is the level of interpersonal trust in a society. This doesn’t mean trust in governments or institutions: both have received lots of coverage during the past two years, and yet appear to have little effect. Rather it’s a measure of how much people think they can trust another citizen who they don’t already know. At every stage in this pandemic, this kind of trust has been a vital resource. After two years we can now see clearly how important it was, raising the question of how we might build it up to deal with both the ongoing threat posed by Covid, and the next pandemic. Results from the past two years show that the extraordinary measures we were asked to follow to “flatten the curve” really can work to reduce or even eliminate infections, particularly when they are deployed during the beginning of a wave. But dig in a little further, and we see that these restrictions work better – and often don’t have to be as harsh or long – in high-trust countries. Countries in the top quartile of interpersonal trust actually spent 30% less time with a stringency index over 70 – meaning living with stay-at-home orders, school and workplace closures, and similar restrictions – than those in the bottom quartile. They also saw half as many deaths per capita in 2020 and 2021. In other words, societies in which people trust each other were able to get far more health benefit from looser restrictions. But interestingly, this effect only holds for interpersonal trust, not for trust in governments. We do not see any difference in the stringency of restrictions applied in countries where citizens trust the government compared to countries where trust in the government is low. Trust in other people is so important because many aspects of fighting a pandemic require collective action. The only way to break a chain of infection is if everyone takes part, for example by following the rules around social distancing. Individuals are much more likely to change their behaviour if they trust others to do so as well. After all, if you expect others to break the rules, why should you be the sucker still sitting at home? In addition, trust may be particularly key for light-touch measures such as contact tracing and self-testing, which are likely to remain key elements of a “new normal” in many countries. If you test positive, do you isolate yourself and help identify those you might have put at risk? If you trust others to do the same, you are more likely to do so. We now know this kind of trust matters immensely. We also know it is in short supply. And, worse, we see evidence that it has fallen during the last two years. The most recent Edelman Global Trust Barometer found sharp declines in overall trust levels in countries such as the US, Germany, Australia and South Korea between 2021 and 2022. These results fit with decades of research showing declining levels of trust in institutions and trust in other people across the globe. These trends are bad news for future preparedness. But there is hope. One of the most surprising findings in the report is that trust in co-workers and neighbours is up around the world. Many of us can think of anecdotes from the past two years when communities have come together to help each other, particularly during those uncertain first months. People organised food delivery for elderly neighbours and stood at their windows to cheer and clap in support of health workers. Through their response to crisis, people showed they could build trust. The key lesson is that trust is not like some natural resource buried in the ground that some societies are lucky to have and that others can never get. Trust is something we all, individually and collectively, produce through our actions, behaviours, beliefs and institutions. That means it can be built up. Governments and policymakers need to ask what can be done to further increase trust. Scholars have identified several key interventions that can promote trust by looking at changing levels of trust in societies across decades: reduce income inequality; fight misinformation on social media; trust people by communicating to them with transparency and honesty. None of these things are easy, none are panaceas, and none depend on governments alone. But government policies and strategies can make them better– – or worse. The research suggests that governments should take this seriously. Building trust can be just as important as investing in new vaccines or hospital beds. As we aim to build a better immune system for the body politic, long-term investments to build trust will be invaluable.

143851,commentisfree/2022/mar/24/scientists-wrong-covid-virus-experts,Opinion,Why can’t some scientists just admit they were wrong about Covid? | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/24/scientists-wrong-covid-virus-experts,"As Britain slowly emerges from the pandemic, after two bruising years, Covid camps are one of the lasting legacies. What I mean by Covid camps are people or groups with particular pandemic positions taken early on that they then continually reinforce by selectively sourcing information, eventually building a base of followers that organise around that position and defend it viciously. It’s unsurprising: similar camps developed around Brexit and other key issues. However, the emergence of scientists also dividing themselves into camps over Covid is more novel. These camps include those who have always compared Covid to seasonal flu and advocated a “let it rip” approach; those who have argued for maximum suppression (and still do); and those who have changed their stance based on emerging data, including around vaccines and variants. There are also camps for those who have always been against masks, noting the lack of evidence over effectiveness; those who have argued for masks regardless of age and context; and those who analyse their cost and benefit in different situations and age groups. The essence of science is asking questions, forming hypotheses for possible answers, and then revising these based on new data. Covid has been a constantly changing situation. One only has to look at the emergence of variants and how policy response had to modify with a steep rise in Delta cases – which was more severe than the original Sars-CoV-2 – and then again with Omicron (which is milder than previous variants). There were also early hypotheses suggesting that many people may have prior immunity from other coronaviruses against Sars-CoV-2. The pandemic has been like seeing something coming through the fog – but being unsure of the contours or exact characteristics of what was approaching. Humility and flexibility in responding were two hallmarks of effective policy response. For example, delaying infections through pursuing maximum suppression or a zero-Covid response were optimal in a pre-vaccine, pre-antiviral era. Every infection averted was giving someone a chance to have access to scientific tools – and live many more healthy years of life. Early in the pandemic we also didn’t understand the full impact of the virus and so had to take a more cautious approach. “Living with Covid”, now that science has largely defanged it, involves ensuring widespread vaccination, as well as creating schemes such as the US government’s “test to treat”. The latter involves Americans going to pharmacies to get tested for Covid and if positive, immediately receiving antivirals on the spot, free of charge. Testing, treatments and vaccines mean that governments can find their “exit” from the pandemic and manage Covid as another one of the many infectious diseases they have to deal with. But instead of evolving their position based on new data, some, instead, keep trying to show how they were still right in early 2020, digging themselves an even deeper hole. A case in point is Stanford professor John Ioannidis, who, in March 2020, argued that governments were overreacting to the threat of Covid. He mocked those who worried that the “68 deaths from Covid-19 in the US as of 16 March will increase exponentially to 680, 6,800, 68,000, 680,000”. He estimated that the US might suffer only 10,000 deaths. He also was cynical that vaccines or treatments could be developed in any timeframe that would affect the trajectory of the pandemic. Two years later, the current US death toll stands at 969,000, with almost 250,000 of those being people under 65. These numbers would have once been seen as outlandish. In addition, in less than a year we had developed safe and effective vaccines – and a year after that, safe and effective antivirals. One would expect these facts to prompt an academic to reconsider their initial assumptions – but instead, Ioannidis has continued to publish articles solidifying his starting position. Why is this the case? Why can’t academics just admit that they might have got their assumptions wrong at the start, or reassess their positions? I think it’s a mix of playing to a fanbase that has formed over two years (in this case, an anti-lockdown, “Covid-as-flu” base), and the idea that moving with new data is a sign of backtracking and weakness, instead of the basic scientific virtue of reflection and re-analysis. The overall need is to be proven “right” for oneself and a small group of followers, rather than right for society. Governments (and the public) have expected scientists to be oracles who can predict the future – and have put them in the spotlight in a previously unusual way. Social and mainstream media have amplified extreme positions – for the sake of debate and the impulse to show “two sides” – instead of trying to find a sensible middle ground. The move in society and workplaces towards largely virtual communication during the pandemic has made this polarisation even worse, with so many primarily communicating via Zoom and social media platforms. In this way, extreme positions have received disproportionate exposure in comparison to the “silent majority” who seem to understand the complexity of the situation – and the need to rely on expertise grounded in data. I have respect and admiration for scientists who have admitted what they got wrong, and also understand that each stage of the pandemic has required a different response, based on the latest data, tools and analysis. “Experts” and influential people stuck in these Covid camps continue to influence the narrative. In some ways, this keeps us stuck reliving and relitigating arguments from early in the pandemic at the very moment we should be focused on the best evidence and policies to help us “exit” the pandemic safely. This should involve the equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics around the globe, protecting those vulnerable to severe disease and rapid-response public health plans based around surveillance. In these moments it’s important to remember the two principles of humility and flexibility in response – and how these don’t fit easily with the new world of media.

144048,commentisfree/2022/mar/23/nhs-covid-desperate-conditions,Opinion,The claim that the NHS 'coped' with Covid is not true - it's drowning and damaged | Rachel Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/nhs-covid-desperate-conditions,"Is truth the first casualty of pandemics? Of all the deplorable claims made about Covid, for me the most brazen was one of the earliest, in April 2020, by Boris Johnson. He said we “succeeded in the first and most important task”, because “at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed. No patient went without a ventilator. No patient was deprived of intensive care … We avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic.” When the prime minister uttered those extraordinary words, immediately after his own hospitalisation with Covid, I nearly choked in disbelief. Our death toll that day had reached 26,771. It was a dizzying number, too vast to comprehend. You grope for analogies to anchor such losses in your mind. This was like 60 jumbo jets full of human beings, each packed to capacity, falling from the sky. The insensitivity of attempting to spin as “success” such manifest horror took my breath away. The truth is, Covid caused a collapse of healthcare as we know it – in both the first and subsequent waves. The NHS was overwhelmed. Two years on, so much rewriting of history has happened, it is easy to forget just how anarchic and desperate conditions were inside our hospitals in early 2020. NHS staff threw everything they had at increasing ICU capacity, but England’s starting point was only 4,000 critical care beds – one of the lowest numbers per head of any country in Europe. Horrified by the images from China and Italy, frontline staff like me implored the government to lock down. Yet hospitals were literally beginning to run out of oxygen before Johnson finally decided to act. The service did not cope so much as shut down. In the frantic scramble to claw together as many ventilated beds as possible, surgical procedures in their thousands were cancelled. Cancers were left undiagnosed. Vulnerable patients dug in at home, too fearful or obedient to present to hospital. Staff couldn’t get tested for Covid. The PPE shortages were real and deadly. As for that “protective ring” Matt Hancock would later try to claim he threw around care homes, it was pure fiction. We all know what really happened to care home residents. Ignored and overlooked, they died in their thousands, not so much “cocooned” – as the government claimed – but incarcerated with Covid.
It serves many people politically to try to rewrite the grim realities of the pandemic as they actually unfolded inside the NHS. If anything, the attempts to spin, erase and deny the lived experience of health and care workers are more concerted now than ever. The mythologising of NHS “heroes” has been replaced by a pernicious new narrative, seductive to those of a libertarian bent, that lockdowns were draconian blunders – a panicky overreaction that must never be repeated. Last month, for example, the Telegraph published a piece by Fraser Nelson dramatically entitled: “Our liberty rests on whether Sage will admit to its horrendous lockdown mistakes.” This could not be more wrong. Certainly lockdowns were a last resort, to be avoided if at all possible. But had we not locked down two years ago today, and again in January 2021, we would have seen corpses in hospital car parks, much like those harrowing images of Covid tents springing up outside hospitals in New York. Even as it was, there were too few ambulances, ventilators and critical care beds to go round. Patients died in corridors, they died in waiting rooms, they even died in hospital toilets. They died at home, alone, waiting for overwhelmed paramedics who couldn’t get there in time. I write these facts not to shock but to urge reflection. It may be politically convenient for the government to embrace the “end” of the pandemic, for example – ending free testing, tracing and the requirement to self-isolate – but 11,000 hospital beds in England remain occupied by patients with Covid. Staff morale, meanwhile, has never been lower. A record number of more than 400 employees in NHS England are quitting their jobs every week. One NHS intensive care consultant recently tweeted: “We started the pandemic with 17 ICU consultants. Over the last 24 months, two have retired, one has resigned, one is on long-term sabbatical, three have been off for long periods with stress – all needed psych support.” Clearly there isn’t a hope of reducing the 6.2 million-strong waiting list in England with staff attrition like that. The bottom line is that the NHS is not coping much better now than it was at Covid’s peaks. We are drowning – in Covid patients, cancer patients, the patients on the waiting list backlogs, and the patients whose conditions have become infinitely more complex and harmful because they’ve been waiting so long. There are so few staff – and those left are so burned out and traumatised – that patients are inevitably being neglected. Oddly, NHS England seems to be following Sajid Javid’s lead in remaining silent about this. So much for NHS candour. If patients matter, then being candid about Covid matters. The government must first be honest about the crisis conditions inside the NHS, and then commit to resourcing an urgent and long-term expansion of frontline staff, future-proofing the NHS against new waves of Covid. False narratives about the NHS “coping” are unhelpful and damaging. Is it any wonder our morale is at rock bottom when our lived experience – the world we inhabit daily – is sanitised, airbrushed and erased, and our political leaders – and much of the media – seem determined to ignore it and “move on”?

And tetanus and diphtheria. And polio. In the race to vaccinate the world against Covid-19, the global drive to suppress some of the biggest killers in history has fallen back. Almost 12bn doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in less than 18 months – a stunning achievement, even if the global distribution has been uneven. Yet more than 30 million children have missed out on other basic vaccinations during the pandemic, with south-east Asia and the eastern Mediterranean region being the worst hit. This means large numbers of young people will be vulnerable to diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus, as well as measles – a disease that continues to kill tens of thousands of people every year. Part of the decline in routine vaccination will have been because of clinics closing and staff being diverted, or falling ill themselves – problems that will gradually improve as health services begin returning to normal. But there are also people who haven’t accepted vaccines for themselves or their children when they’ve been offered them. Given the dangerous dip in vaccination levels, the challenge of building trust in vaccines has now become more important than ever as we enter World Immunization Week. The good news is that we now know a lot about how to increase vaccine uptake, and the pandemic has taught us some important lessons. First, while the past few years have, perhaps understandably, increased many people’s hostility towards those who refuse vaccines, lumping them together into a homogenous group of “anti-vaxxers” is unwise – especially as dialogue with these groups is crucial to increasing the overall vaccine uptake. Some find this term offensive: they may not be “anti” anything but have questions or concerns about a vaccine or vaccines. The reality is that vaccine hesitancy is a spectrum. At one end are the hardliners whose appetite for absorbing attention is insatiable but who are not for changing. At the other are those whose views are not yet permanently fixed. In Target the Fence-Sitters, a landmark 2011 Nature paper, Prof Julie Leask of the University of Sydney, made the case for engaging with those who can be won over. Coaxing – or insulting – the hardliners is a waste of energy, and risks nudging mildly hesitant people in the wrong direction. More than a decade on from that much-cited publication, research on why people vaccinate (or not) is mounting. Some of this has been applied to good effect during the Covid-19 rollout, yet there is still much to learn. One important problem is that vaccine conversations have become more polarised and political during the pandemic. Health authorities need to work on reducing the “cost” of changing one’s mind about vaccination. Doing a U-turn doesn’t feel good. If choosing to vaccinate is seen as a personal capitulation or political concession then it becomes deeply unconformable. No political grouping has a monopoly on absorbing vaccines into their worldview. In the US, right-leaning voters are less likely to be vaccinated; in the UK, Tory-voting constituencies are more likely to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, “wellness influencers” are a growing source of vaccine misinformation as part of what Prof Heidi Larson, of the Vaccine Confidence Project, calls the “pursuit of purity”. As vaccination is increasingly wrapped up in people’s identity, attitudes can calcify quickly. The trouble with this is that it can make people feel as if they are betraying themselves or their “tribe” if they later opt to be vaccinated. And once someone has opted out of one vaccine, they become more likely to opt out of others. This means those who refuse a Covid jab might not take their next flu vaccine. Uncoupling vaccines from people’s philosophical, religious or political attitudes prevents hesitancy hardening into refusal. Politics aside, there are more practical steps that can be taken to improve vaccine uptake. For starters, there is evidence that “presumptive recommendations” can increase acceptance, so instead of opening a debate on vaccines with every patient or parent, doctors might say, “It’s time for Charlie’s measles jab” rather than, “Would you like to make an appointment for Charlie’s measles jab?”. Engaging in greater depth would happen with those who have questions. For those who are hesitant, motivational interviewing – a time-consuming but effective way to inject a little empathy into doctor-patient conversations on vaccination – has also shown promise in improving vaccination receptiveness by discussing individual drivers of scepticism. The crucial skill is listening. Doctors ask their patient to voice their concerns about vaccines, offering specific responses in a non-judgmental manner. Both parties accept that they may not see vaccines in the same way but are open to discussion. This takes the heat out of any potential conflict and leaves the door open to a change of heart. In 2014, a report by a WHO working group set out the 3Cs of vaccine hesitancy: convenience, complacency and confidence. Easy access to free immunisation may be a bigger challenge in the global south, but convenience is too often overlooked while we obsess about confidence. The best way to find out why people skip vaccines is to ask them. When measles outbreaks gripped orthodox Jewish communities in London, it may have been tempting to imagine a religious or philosophical objection to the MMR vaccine. But when asked, parents – many of whom had large families – cited as an obstacle the inconvenience of taking several children across the city on public transport. Service providers responded by scheduling clinics nearby on days that suited the community, supported by information leaflets and reminders. Complacency matters too. To reach herd immunity against measles, uptake needs to hit about 95%. But once the virus is suppressed this can slip, opening the door to a resurgence. Confidence, of course, is still hard won and easily lost. But there are lessons that Covid campaigns – and rejuvenated routine immunisation drives – can learn from how dips in public trust in other vaccines have been reversed. When HPV vaccination rates in Ireland fell from 87% to 50% in 2015, a broad alliance of health professionals, teachers, parents, cancer societies and children’s advocacy groups came together to show their support for the campaign. A media campaign fronted by a high-profile cervical cancer patient helped Ireland to arrest the decline and made vaccination the norm. To the credit of some health authorities, several Covid-19 immunisation campaigns have adopted personalised vaccine invitations and made vaccinations more convenient by allowing community pharmacists to offer the jab. Most have avoided the kind of blunt myth-busting and debunking that can backfire, instead finding ways to apply science communication research and tackle misinformation in the real world. There is a growing acceptance that facts alone are not enough to win people over.
Australia has developed decision aids to walk people through the pros and cons of signing up, the US has been quick to try mobile pop-up vaccine clinics, and Romania has offered jabs at popular tourist spots (including Dracula’s castle). And aside from Emmanuel Macron’s ill-advised pledge to “piss off” the unvaccinated, France has recorded stellar uptake of Covid-19 vaccinations – despite being dubbed “the most vaccine-sceptical country in the world” and polling indicating that French people would shun the vaccine. The lesson: even countries steeped in vaccine scepticism can turn things around if they get the incentives right. Now it’s time to apply all of this with unprecedented energy to closing the immunisation gaps that have emerged during the pandemic.

147426,commentisfree/2022/may/25/monkeypox-disease-climate-change,Opinion,Monkeypox isn’t the disease we should be worried about | John Vidal,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/monkeypox-disease-climate-change,"In the past three weeks there have been nearly 100 cases and 18 human deaths from a rare tick-borne disease in Iraq; a fourth case of the Ebola virus and more than 100 cases of bubonic plague have been found in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and just two years after Africa was declared free of wild polio, new cases have turned up in Malawi and Mozambique. A dangerous strain of typhus is circulating in Nepal, India and China. There are alarming outbreaks on several continents of mosquito diseases such as malaria, dengue and West Nile virus. Set against this global context, the so-far very limited monkeypox outbreaks that have started to appear in the last month – including 71 cases detected in the UK – are only remarkable because they are being reported in rich countries. It has been a bad month for infectious disease, according to the ProMED website, the world’s largest open surveillance system for reporting outbreaks. Covid and HIV are both still globally rampant, and now animal pandemics are on the march, too. African swine fever continues to ravage the world’s pigs and several strains of lethal avian – or bird flu – are spreading, forcing the cull of hundreds of millions of poultry. Vets and ecologists have warned this month, too, of mysterious fungal diseases being found in fish and marine life in Australia and in Middle Eastern countries, well as lethal dog and other pet illnesses.
We live uneasily with many thousands of potentially fatal viruses circulating in other species, but what is remarkable is that most of those that affect humans today were unknown just 70 years ago. Not only are new pathogens jumping from animals to humans more often, but an increasing number are linked to the changes in the global and local environments. It is no coincidence that since 1940, 335 new and potentially fatal diseases have emerged globally, over a period when the human population has trebled, the climate has changed and more meat is being eaten. Disease ecologists say that nothing increases the risk of a crossover of a pathogen from one species to another like the uncontrolled expansion of farming, and the exploitation by humans of wild species. It is now payback time for nature. The more human numbers have grown and we have encroached on wild spaces or imposed unnatural conditions on other species, the more we have created the ideal environments for viruses and pathogens to spill across species, mutate and spread. HIV, Ebola, Lassa fever and monkey pox in Africa; Sars and Covid-19 in China; Chagas, Machupo and Hantavirus in Latin America; Hendra in Australia; Mers in Saudi Arabia – all have all emerged in the past 75 years just as we have accelerated deforestation, moved to cities, come closer to animals and created a global economy. Most worrying for humans is not monkeypox, plague or even Ebola, which sound dangerous and exotic but are actually more or less controllable now with vaccines. Instead, the threat of a new bird flu, just as likely to come out of a farm in New York or England as one in China or Bolivia, now stalks humanity. Chicken is now the rich world’s most popular meat and tens of millions of near-genetically identical birds prone to catastrophic disease are being mass-reared at any one time, often in unhygienic conditions, and are able to mix with wild birds. It is only a matter of decades before a new highly pathogenic avian influenza strain evolves to be easily transmissible between humans. As much by luck as good judgment, humans dodged a bullet with Sars in 2003 and to some extent with Covid, which so far has killed about 1% of people infected. But major flu pandemics with very high mortality rates come along every 30 years or so and we are well overdue the next. If we are lucky we will find a vaccine fast and it will only kill 10-20% of people it infects. If we are unlucky, it could be just as transmissible as Omicron and as fatal as Ebola – in which case it would effectively be game over for much of humanity and the global economy. But we may have seen nothing yet. Climate change is now kicking in, creating a hotter, sicker world with a potentially catastrophic impact on disease. Global heating fundamentally changes the landscape of disease by forcing or enabling species to survive in new places and mix with others. Insects already kill about 700,000 people a year, but global heating allows mosquitoes, mites, fleas, ticks and other vectors to flourish in new areas, spreading dengue, chikungunya, and other diseases to higher ground or to previously cooler climates.
Canadian bacteriologists have shown how in times of great historical environmental change – like now – pathogens jump more easily to new, susceptible hosts. All they need is the opportunity for contact, and warming does just that. Once they have expanded to new hosts, novel variants are more likely to emerge, each with new infection capacities. The situation looks bleak, but it is well within human ability to repair and turn this round. Science and new technologies are catching up with vaccines for rare and neglected diseases, and global surveillance and the early detection of potential virus spillovers in the wild can be greatly enhanced. But above all, global finance can be directed to improve creaking public health systems, especially in developing countries. They are the first line of defence and the surest precaution of disease containment. The big lesson of Covid – and now of monkeypox – is that much infectious disease has its roots in ecological change. That means the health of the planet and the health of humans and must be considered alongside that of animals. It also means we should prepare now for the unexpected, invest in public health as never before, stop cutting down the forests, address climate change and phase out intensive farming. A “one health”, planetary approach to health is the best – and possibly the only – hope we have. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor",2022-05-25 05:00:26+00:00,147427,2
148043,commentisfree/2022/jun/30/polio-virus-britain-london-sewer-vaccination,Opinion,The discovery of the polio virus in Britain proves we can never let our guard down | Andrew Pollard,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/30/polio-virus-britain-london-sewer-vaccination,"The finding of a polio virus in repeated sampling from the sewage system in London during 2022 is less of a concern for highly vaccinated communities in the UK, where children are immune to the rare chance of paralysis. However, it is a portent of potential individual catastrophe for families with unvaccinated and undervaccinated children in our capital unless there is urgent action. In these pandemic times, we shouldn’t need much reminding that there are some bad viruses out there, and there always have been. But intervening urgently to control epidemics and outbreaks with vaccines is relatively new. The devastating polio epidemics of the 1940s and 1950s, which left thousands of children paralysed in the UK, were very much in the public eye at the time, with the familiar images of hospitals full of children in coffin-like iron lungs or paralysed children with their legs in callipers.
These epidemics were finally extinguished in many countries as a result of the mass deployment of two different polio vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. Here, the success of the polio programme led to the formation of JCVI, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in 1963, and development of a coordinated immunisation programme that protects our children to this day. By the 1980s, despite the invention of the vaccine 30 years earlier, there were still more than 300,000 yearly polio cases worldwide because of failures in coordination globally and lack of deployment in many countries. But, as a result of huge efforts, a remarkable impact has been seen since then. Two of the three types of wild polio virus (type 2 and type 3) have been driven to extinction by vaccine immunity; only type 1 is left. It may be possible to eradicate this virus completely from the world. And we are very close to seeing the back of it – in the past 12 months there were only 16 documented cases of paralytic polio caused by the remaining type 1 virus globally (down from 176 cases in 2019). This success has largely been driven by use of Sabin’s live oral vaccine, which anyone over the age of 18 will have received as drops by mouth or, like me, will fondly remember as a dose on a sugar cube. This vaccine is especially good at preventing the disease and also halting transmission of the virus. It has already stopped polio in most of the world. There are huge efforts towards eradication, focused on improving vaccine coverage in the few remaining countries where the virus is still found, with most attention on improving access in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is 42 years since smallpox was eradicated, could it be time for polio? We are not there yet and there were some notable setbacks with cases in Malawi and Mozambique in the last year, but the end of another menace of history feels possible. While we are tantalisingly close to eradicating wild polio, it isn’t straightforward. The live Sabin vaccine, which has been saving the world from polio epidemics for 70 years, can very rarely undergo freak mutations, which paradoxically renders it capable of causing paralysis in undervaccinated populations. Nevertheless, the Sabin vaccine continues to be a critical part of the global programme because of its special characteristics in improving immune responses in the gut and thereby reducing spread of wild polio. Now that polio is on the retreat, greater attention is being turned towards avoiding rare cases of paralysis caused by mutated Sabin viruses. The most important part of the approach is, perhaps counterintuitively, to improve vaccine coverage with the Sabin vaccine, as paralysis does not happen in highly immune populations. Many countries that have managed to eliminate the virus, usually using the live Sabin vaccine, have changed to using the Salk vaccine. The Salk vaccine contains a killed virus that cannot mutate or spread and has been part of the routine vaccine programme in the UK since 2004. All children in the UK are offered five doses of the injected Salk polio vaccine during childhood. It is an imported Sabin virus in the sewage in London that threatens children there, and the risk can be eliminated by improving vaccine coverage. Unfortunately, some of the lowest vaccine coverage in the UK is in some parts of London, in the very places where children are at potential risk from this virus. The solution is simple, free and safe: children who haven’t had a dose, or have missed doses, must get vaccinated as soon as possible. Polio isn’t the only vaccine-preventable disease out there, and can strike if we drop our guard and let vaccine coverage fall. Outbreaks of measles, mumps and diphtheria have all occurred in undervaccinated individuals in the UK over the past decade. Vaccines are immensely powerful in controlling infectious threats – but they only work if we use them.

148059,commentisfree/2022/jun/30/covid-uk-cases-vaccines-matt-hancock,Opinion,"Yes, the number of Covid cases in the UK is rising – but that is no cause for alarm | Matt Hancock",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/30/covid-uk-cases-vaccines-matt-hancock,"Four months ago, the UK took the decision to end all remaining legal Covid-19 restrictions, becoming the first major country in the world to do so. While some said it was too soon and that it would lead to a surge in cases, hospitalisations and deaths, this has thankfully not been the case. Instead, we have replaced the protection from lockdowns with the protection from science in the power of vaccines. Seeing and taking part in the incredible scenes around the UK to celebrate the Queen’s platinum jubilee just over three weeks ago showed just how far we have come in living with this virus. But even though we can rely on vaccines to protect us from severe illness or death, a virus as transmissible as Covid will not be eradicated. I have consistently said that Covid “will always be around” and that we should “live with Covid as we do flu”. It was striking, therefore, to read yet more alarmist stories last week about the rise in Covid-19 cases, with some even calling for the reintroduction of restrictions. There are some saying that the pandemic is not yet over. As the man who led calls for restrictions during the pandemic as health secretary, I understand the worries that people have; this is a truly horrible virus. So many people have died, here and around the world, and many more have had awful experiences with the disease. But I also know that we now have the tools to deal with this virus and any calls for restrictions should be categorically rejected. The question I ask those who want more restrictions is where does it end? We said throughout the pandemic that our strategy was to suppress the virus until vaccines could keep us safe. Nearly 9 in 10 people aged 12 and over have had two vaccine doses and nearly 7 in 10 people aged 12 or over have had their booster vaccine. In all, more than 149m doses have been injected into our arms. This is an incredible feat considering we were told in January 2020 that a vaccine might not ever be available, and could take up to 10 years to create. While the latest Office for National Statistics survey shows that infections are rising, we are not seeing nearly the same levels of hospitalisations or deaths as we did before the vaccine. Figures published just last week show that an estimated 99.3% of the population have antibodies – whether through infection or vaccination. So as a result, although infections are rising, we are not being swamped by yet another Covid wave. Just as we come forward each year for our flu inoculation, we must do the same for our yearly Covid vaccine. The solution to rising cases is not lockdowns or restrictions on our liberties, but vaccines. This is not just the case in Britain, but around the world. Covid is a global virus, so needs global solutions. Because while Covid is endemic here, it is still having a major impact on much of the developing world. I read with great pride that Covid vaccines reduced the global death toll by almost 20m in their first year. The UK should be proud of its contribution to this global effort. The UK government, working with Oxford University and AstraZeneca ensured that our vaccine would be available at cost around the world. We waived any charge for intellectual property for the Oxford vaccine to allow more areas to manufacture vaccines and increase global supply. Almost two-thirds of the global population have received at least one vaccine. An estimated quarter of these have been delivered with the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab – and because we supplied it at cost, that proportion is much higher in developing countries. It is a huge credit to the whole team that 179 countries now use the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. As well as this very direct contribution the UK was also one of the earliest backers of the Covax scheme and invested over half a billion of taxpayers’ money into the scheme so we could help the world get vaccinated. There is clearly more that must still be done. We must be ready for variants that evade the vaccine, as well as for the next pandemic, and other new diseases. But let’s not fall into the trap of yet more restrictions and scaremongering. This will just set us back further. Let’s instead back the team to deliver the vaccines we need to protect us all and make the most of our freedoms.

You may have been stuck in bed with it twice or even three times by now; by April 2022, England alone had recorded almost 900,000 reinfections. When the public asked to “return to normal”, I’m not sure a regular hacking cough was what they had in mind. It is an odd situation. Last week, Covid infections were reported to have soared by 43%, while hospitalisation from the virus rose by 23%. An estimated 1.7 million people in the UK tested positive over those seven days. Two million of us now have long Covid, with about two in five of those – or 826,000 people – having symptoms for at least a year. And yet, listen to Boris Johnson or his ministers and you’d be forgiven for thinking none of this was really happening. As a new coronavirus wave threatens to hit the country once again, the government appears more interested in scrapping human rights than protecting human lives. Welcome to sick man Britain: where the public are left to catch coronavirus repeatedly, and ministers pretend everything is fine. Back in February, Johnson said the government had created a plan to start “living with Covid”, but what it really did was form a plan to catch and spread Covid. After all coronavirus prevention measures were dropped on 1 April – from the legal obligation to isolate if you had Covid, to the end of most free testing – the public were left wide open to mass infection. Even hospitals were told by ministers to ditch mask mandates, though some worried trusts have defied the rules and kept them. That all precautions were pulled back just when most people’s vaccine immunity was beginning to fade, and the virus was evolving to be more transmissible, gives a hint at how little logic ministers applied. One of the biggest problems facing Britain’s attempts to quell the virus is that this government doesn’t really want to. There is hope – the number of people dying from Covid has reduced since its peak – but excessive focus on this has long hidden the fact that loss of life has never been the only thing that matters: how many people are infected with the virus matters too. A strategy that lets the virus rip through the population increases the risk we all face, be it from surges, new dangerous variants, or in developing long Covid. Fundamentally, it means accepting a reality where it is deemed normal for many of us to be (possibly severely) sick, from a virus whose long-term effects – and the effects of repeated reinfection – we still know little about. The likely longterm impact on the economy and society is similarly grim. It means more pressure on an NHS that’s already creaking under the weight of backlogs. It means sickness absences across key sectors and frontline workers, from nurses to teachers. Children missing more school. Not to mention soaring social security bills from long Covid patients who are too sick to work (the government’s solution to this appears to be turning them down for disability benefits).
There will be few greater casualties though than the 3.7 million clinically extremely vulnerable people, especially the 500,000 who are immunocompromised and can’t get much or any benefit from a booster jab. Trying to avoid the virus in a country that has forgone all safety measures means risking your life when you pop to the shops. Ministers who are content for repeated coronavirus infection to just become part of British life are content for isolation to be part of clinically vulnerable people’s. There is an alternative. Campaigners are calling on the government to reinstate free lateral flow tests, the isolation requirement for those with a positive test, and financial help such as sick pay – few rational voices could disagree. Fixing our dire sick pay rates is only becoming more pressing in a cost of living crisis that means low-paid and insecure workers are likely to feel obliged to go into work when they have Covid. We must also start a long-term investment in ventilation and air filtration that can help make schools and workplaces safer, as well as making lifesaving antiviral treatment more accessible to clinically vulnerable patients. It’s also time for a renewed public health campaign for boosters; as of this month, around a fifth of people aged 75 and over in England are yet to have a fourth Covid jab. And fiddly though it is, wearing masks in busy and enclosed spaces again is the right thing to do; just under half of Britons (48%) reported wearing a face covering when outside their home last month, down from about 95% during the January Omicron wave. After two long, tough years, no one wants to still be dealing with coronavirus. I don’t want to be writing this column. But unless we wish to sign up to getting repeatedly sick for the foreseeable future, and to the risk of long-term disability from long Covid, we are going to have to bring back low-effort protective measures to curb it. A recent public health campaign in Ireland, which encourages people to think of clinically vulnerable people in their daily interactions, shows how easy it is to do things differently. The government may want to stop thinking about coronavirus, but in doing so, it is ensuring that all of us have to think about it for a long time to come. That’s something we will surely all get sick of fast. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist",2022-06-28 07:00:09+00:00,148515,2
148629,commentisfree/2022/jun/27/nhs-british-public-health-service-press,Opinion,The NHS wreckers cannot accept that the British public still back it | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/27/nhs-british-public-health-service-press,"“Are we falling out of love with the NHS?” That Spectator question ricochets around the rightwing media in a hailstorm of attacks on the NHS. They expect trouble if next month’s NHS pay review bodies recommend deeper real pay cuts for staff already earning considerably less than in 2010. The aim of these Tory attacks is clearly to see that blame lands squarely on the NHS itself, not on the government. Here’s a sample of this rightwing groundswell, for Guardian readers who may not see the anti-NHS rhetoric that Tory politicians and voters imbibe daily. The Mail says the NHS has made us “the sick man of the world”. “It’s time to realise the NHS is not a ‘religion’ – our hospitals are not the envy of the world,” blasts Trevor Kavanagh of the Sun. “The NHS is failing us all,” says the Spectator. The Telegraph emits such a powerful crescendo of assaults that the Health Service Journal has added its editor to its 2022 list of the 100 most influential people in health. One Telegraph editorial accuses the national insurance levy of “squeezing largely Tory voters in order to prop up an unreformed, and increasingly unpopular, socialised behemoth”. The Telegraph’s Charles Moore relishes every bad news NHS story: “Patients are failed by the NHS’s blind belief in its own altruism – and no politician can admit it,” and “Tinkering with NHS governance is hardly the radical reform patients crave.” More intemperate Telegraph assaults come from Allison Pearson: “Surprise surprise, the NHS has spent its windfall on yet more waste and wokery.” She takes a swing at “so many doctors on the golf course, feeling fatigued or attending to pressing matters in the Dordogne”. Her columnist colleague Judith Woods rails: “It’s time to ditch the mawkish NHS love-in”, bewailing “hand-wringing sentimentality about the need to preserve our creaky NHS from the ‘threat’ of a social health insurance system that would raise standards”. Recent attacks draw on a report from Civitas, the rightwing thinktank, not short of ammunition as it adumbrates all the bad numbers easily found in the parlous state of the NHS. The Spectator’s Kate Andrews, late of the opaquely funded rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs, wrote in the Telegraph, “As healthcare delivery continues to worsen, criticism of the UK’s sacred cow seems – ever so slightly – more mainstream. But underperformance in the NHS is nothing new … [It] was letting down patients long before the pandemic hit, and without serious reform is likely to continue to do so long after.” That drew a sharp riposte from Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners writing with the leaders of the NHS Providers and NHS Confederation, calling Andrews’ article “insulting and inaccurate”. “People throughout our NHS and social care system are moving heaven and earth to recover ground and reduce care backlogs while dealing with the continuing impact of Covid-19 … Ambulance services are working at a level never seen before … With more than 2.1 million A&E attendances, hospital emergency care saw the busiest March on record … GP appointments are exceeding pre-pandemic levels. More people have been seen for suspected cancer.” And no, NHS leaders “do not see the NHS as a sacred cow that cannot be improved”. The Telegraph hit straight back in a leader column, accusing NHS officials of ignoring “how the NHS is failing” which “people can see for themselves”. Those “challenging the experience of millions are engaged in a form of ‘gaslighting’ – defined as making someone question their own reality”. Gaslighting! No one denies the dire state of the NHS. Critics don’t need to stretch the truth. Not with the current waiting list of 6.2 million people – the longest on record. The argument is about who is to blame – and these critics are sharpening their knives for that fight. Of course they exaggerate, gleefully cherrypicking the worst anecdotes from the news or family and friends. It’s worth remembering that most treatments go well: the Care Quality Commission’s latest adult inpatient survey found 84% “had confidence and trust in the doctors … treating them”, and 85% said “they were always treated with respect and dignity”. Answering falsehoods about featherbedded bureaucrats, Amanda Pritchard, the head of NHS England, reminded the annual NHSConfed conference this month that just 2p in the NHS pound was spent on administration: “In France, it’s double that, and in the USA, it’s four times.” Whenever the NHS falls into the abyss through underfunding it hits an existential crisis when its ancient ideological opponents, dormant in the good years, creep out of the earth like a revived locust plague. What excited them this time was the latest British Social Attitudes survey showing that public satisfaction with the NHS had plummeted to 36%. It has only ever been lower once, at 34% in 1997, presaging the fall of a Tory government. Hoping for a popular revolt against the NHS, critics ignore the rest of this survey. The reasons for dissatisfaction were obvious: waiting times for GP and hospital appointments, staff shortages and government underfunding. Only 25% think the NHS should not get more funds. Across Labour and Tory supporters there were “high levels of support” for NHS founding principles – 94% backing free for everyone, 86% for funding through taxes. No solace there for the “reformers” wanting private insurance and top-ups. They always leave to the last line a coded yearning for this “reform”, because they know it reads badly, and because if they have done an iota of research, they can only find facts showing it would be more expensive for all, with far higher admin costs. Their nebulous praise for other EU systems ignores that, one way or another, they are more or less the same as our national insurance topped up with income tax. The true comparison with similar countries is that France and Germany have always spent more, with many more beds, doctors and nurses per head of population. Above all, they omit the UK’s decade of its harshest NHS funding ever, which began with deep cuts to doctor and nurse training, whose effects we feel now. They prefer facts like these: “The service ranks 15th [in the OECD] for perinatal mortality” (Kate Andrews again in the Telegraph). They never say that this is a shocking and novel phenomenon of this Tory decade, and is, as the health inequalities expert Michael Marmot shows, caused more by British poverty than NHS failings (like so many bad health results). However, take heart: the public is not falling out of love with the NHS, but with the NHS wreckers. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",2022-06-27 14:19:38+00:00,148630,16
148643,commentisfree/2022/jun/27/polio-detected-uk-outbreak-infectious-disease,Opinion,Should we be worried that polio has been detected in the UK?  | Devi Sridhar,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/27/polio-detected-uk-outbreak-infectious-disease,"Covid-19 variants, monkeypox and now polio: you might wonder what else will be thrown at us in 2022. Last week in London, polio was detected in sewage screened by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), which has been surveilling the disease for decades as part of an international commitment to the World Health Organization. The latest screening and analysis with metagenomics indicates that this polio strain is derived from the oral polio vaccine (OPV) still used in some parts of the world. Some countries use live, non-infective, non-virulent polio virus for their inoculations, which can evolve to become infectious in some cases. So we now know there has been introduction and then transmission of one of these strains within London – though the exact cases have yet to be identified. Most people’s introduction to the concept of global health has been through Covid-19, and so it has come to be associated with broad population-wide measures such as mask mandates, closure of sectors, stay at home orders and limits on mixing. When hearing about polio and monkeypox, the response to Covid-19 might jump to mind. But this was a new disease, spread through respiratory mechanisms, for which there was no vaccine or established therapy, that threatened to bring about complete heathcare collapse. Covid-19 prompted a broad and extreme response given the threat of mass death. The response to polio is different. First, in the UK we have a safe and incredibly effective vaccine for polio, commonly referred to as IPV. This is administered as a jab by a trained medical professional. IPV is part of the standard childhood immunisation programme and, with all four doses, is 99-100% effective. There is no live virus in this vaccine. For this outbreak, the key steps are for public health teams to track down these cases in London to limit spread and stop further transmission, and for parents to be encouraged to check their children are vaccinated against polio. Vaccination is the best protection, but good hygiene measures are important too: polio is introduced into the body through the mouth and often from faeces (poo). Recent outbreaks of measles and mumps in Britain reveal how many children have not had their routine childhood jabs, and how complacency over vaccination has taken hold as memory of diseases such as whooping cough and tetanus fades. The emergence of polio in London also reminds us of the irreducibly global nature of health. Because of the relatively higher cost of IPV, and the need for decent health systems (including staff and equipment) to administer it, the live oral vaccine is still used in many places. Virus-shedding from someone recently vaccinated can spread to others. Mutations during transmission among unvaccinated individuals can result in a vaccine-derived poliovirus which can have the same negative impact as wild polio (ie paralysis). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is now working to replace the use of OPV, given its risks, with at least one dose of IPV. While wild poliovirus is endemic in just Afghanistan and Pakistan, vaccine-derived polio cases are regularly identified in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world. Contending with multiple infectious diseases at the same time is normal in most parts of the world. Cholera, plague, malaria and measles still circulate and cause illness and death, despite major global health efforts to support governments in managing them. We know about these recent polio cases because of surveillance: having routine testing in place meant that the underlying pathogen and its genetic sequencing were quickly detected and identified. And as part of the scientific advances made during the Covid-19 pandemic, surveillance has become better, especially in richer countries. However, it’s not the only reason we’re hearing more about outbreaks. We are actually having more outbreaks across the world, and diseases are spreading in unexpected ways. The underlying reasons are: more contact between animals and humans (when spillover events happen); animals being kept in unhygienic conditions (such as industrial farming); deforestation; increased urbanisation (people living close together); and connectivity (people travelling all over the globe). Hearing the news from London feels like a step backwards given how close the entire world has been to global polio eradication in recent years; however, we have managed polio outbreaks before, and it will be controlled again. The history of humanity is the history of various pathogens trying to disable and kill us – and equally the history of scientific and public health advances, and human ingenuity in staying ahead of them. Some humility in the face of infectious diseases and recognition of our global interdependence are always needed.

An estimated 1.4 million people in the UK – more than 2% of the population – would have tested positive last week according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey. Chances are you know someone who’s got the disease. Covid hospitalisations have also been rising for the past couple of weeks. On Monday there were more than 1,000 admissions in England – the first time we’ve reached that level since April. It’s possible that some of the stark 40% week-on-week rise in prevalence reported last Friday is due to large numbers of people getting together over the extended platinum jubilee weekend. However, scientists who have been monitoring the Covid situation closely have been predicting an uptick for a while now. Two new subvariants – BA.4 and BA.5 – of the Omicron variant have been increasing their share of UK infections for several weeks. Last week they finally overtook the BA.2 version of Omicron responsible for the most recent wave that the UK experienced, in March and April. Although there is no evidence that these new subvariants cause more severe disease, their rise to dominance suggests that they can, at least to some degree, evade existing immunity. There are, however, some reasons for optimism. It’s far from certain that we will see the same level of infections or hospital admissions that we saw in the previous two Omicron waves. Portugal is coming down from a BA.5 wave in which hospitalisations reached 80% of their previous Omicron peak. In contrast, South Africa, which is over the worst of its BA.4/5 wave, hasn’t seen hospitalisations climb anywhere near the levels of the December/January Omicron peak. Another positive is that we are starting from a lower baseline than the most recent wave. Steep falls in infection levels have given hospitals some opportunity to recover from the Covid-related pressures they were experiencing. While it’s important to remember that there is a lag between cases rising and people ending up in the ICU, it is promising to note that steep rises in hospital admissions have not yet been accompanied by commensurate rises in the number of Covid patients in mechanical-ventilation beds. Nevertheless, hospitals are still under severe strain with waits for ambulances far above their targets; accident and emergency waiting times are through the roof; and almost one in nine people in the UK are waiting to start NHS treatment.
As well as the potential impact on hospitals and the inevitable increase in the nearly 200,000 people who have lost their lives to Covid, any rise in infection levels will necessarily lead to more people with long Covid. About 2 million people in the UK are living with self-reported long Covid, according to the latest ONS survey. Almost 400,000 of these suggest it has a significant impact on their day-to-day activities. With the recent tribunal ruling that long Covid is a disability, we must start to ask questions about the long-term economic viability of continually and repeatedly allowing huge swathes of our population to become infected with a potentially disabling virus. Surely, we must start to invest in technology, like ventilation and air filtration, which will help to make schools and workplaces safer. We should also seriously consider improving sick pay so that people can afford to self-isolate when they are unwell, rather than going into work and infecting their colleagues. When Boris Johnson suggested in his February “living with Covid” strategy that we should learn lessons from our German counterparts, who are “much more disciplined about not going to work if you’re sick”, he neglected to mention that Germany has one of the best and most comprehensive sick-pay policies in the OECD, whereas the UK has one of the worst. The other bad news regarding this wave relates to its timing – in the middle of a patch of good summer weather. If ever there were a period when we would hope to see sustained falls in the levels of Covid it would be now, when it’s more attractive to meet in low-transmission outdoor environments. Sadly, this solstitial resurgence indicates that the pattern of repeated variant-driven waves is one we might expect to live with for the foreseeable future.
While huge swathes of the world’s population remain unvaccinated, high levels of Covid transmission present the opportunity for new immunity-evading variants to emerge. That fact makes the UK’s international Covid strategy seem perverse. Embarrassingly, the UK was one of the last hold-outs to the World Trade Organization’s belated partial agreement to waive vaccine patents. And despite promising last year to donate 100m vaccines to low-income countries, by May of this year fewer than 36.5m had been dispatched. The word pandemic derives from the Greek pandemos meaning “pertaining to all the people”. To solve this global problem, we need truly global solutions that make all the people of the world safe. We cannot, despite Matt Hancock’s claim, unilaterally declare ourselves “past the pandemic”. It doesn’t work like that. • Kit Yates is director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath and author of The Maths of Life and Death",2022-06-23 11:42:36+00:00,149460,2
